  "The  early  policy  of the  East  India  Company  was  that  of  non\u00ad",
  "intervention  in Indian social matters.  Along with pragmatism  that ",
  "demanded  continuation  of existing systems, there was also a respect ",
  "for  traditional  Indian  culture  that  expressed  itself  in  Warren ",
  "Hastings's  policy of Orientalism.  It meant,  as we have discussed in ",
  "the  previous  chapter,  an  attempt  to  learn  about  Indian  culture ",
  "through  a study of scriptures in Sanskrit and Persian languages, and ",
  "to use that  knowledge in matters  of governance.  The result of this ",
  "endeavour  was the establishment  of the Asiatic Society of Bengal, ",
  "the Calcutta Madrassa  and the  Sanskrit College at Banaras. Know\u00ad",
  "ledge about  the  subject population,  their  social customs,  manners ",
  "and codes were regarded  as a necessary prerequisite  for developing ",
  "permanent  institutions  of rule. Hastings's policy to govern the con\u00ad",
  "quered  in  their\u00b7 own  ways and  resist Anglicisation  thus  reflected ",
  "Orientalist  ideological preferences and also political pragmatism. ",
  "Since the  end  of Hastings's  tenure  there  was a  gradual  move ",
  "towards  cautious  intervention  in  Indian  social  institutions.  What ",
  "contributed  to this shift, as we have seen earlier, were several ideo\u00ad",
  "logical influences in Britain, such as Evangelicalism, Utilitarianism ",
  "and  free  trade  thinking.  While  the  Utilitarians  began  to  talk  of ",
  "appropriate  social  engineering  and  authoritarian  reformism,  the ",
  "Evangelists argued  about  the necessity of government  intervention ",
  "to  liberate  Indians  from  their  religions  that  were  full of supersti\u00ad",
  "tions, idolatry and tyranny of the priests. The free trade thinkers too ",
  "wanted  government  intervention  to free Indian  economy  from  the ",
  "shackles of tradition  to ensure  a free flow of trade.  But the  Com\u00ad",
  "pany's  government  was still tentative  about  interfering  for fear of ",
  "adverse Indian  reaction.  It could  not  do so unless a section  of the ",
  "Indian society was prepared  to support  reform.  Such a group  that ",
  "would  support  wide  ranging  social  reforms  in India  was soon  to https://telegram.me/UPSCMaterials https://telegram.me/FreeUPSCMaterials https://telegram.me/MaterialforExam",
  "140  FROM  PLASSEYTO  PARTITION ",
  "emerge  through  the  introduction  of English  education,  which  be\u00ad",
  "came therefore  the first and the most important area of intervention ",
  "and innovation  for the Company's  state in India. ",
  "English education  was introduced in India in the eighteenth cen\u00ad",
  "tury through the charity  schools  run in Calcutta,  Madras and Bom\u00ad",
  "bay for the education  of the European  and Anglo-Indian children. ",
  "The Company  supported  these schools in various  ways, but did not ",
  "take  any direct  responsibility  for the education  of the indigenous ",
  "population  until  1813.  Charles Grant's advocacy of English  educa\u00ad",
  "tion  to be introduced  in  India  fell on deaf ears before the Charter ",
  "Act of 1793 for fear of political  unrest. His major concern was how\u00ad",
  "ever about  the misrule of the Company officials. The real hegemony ",
  "of the British, he thought, could be established  in  India through  a ",
  "display of the superior  moral and ethical values of the West as mani\u00ad",
  "fested  in  its  Christian heritage.  Christian  instruction  was  the  best ",
  "guarantee against rebellion,  as it would rescue the natives from their ",
  "polytheistic Hinduism  and  make them parts of the assimilative pro\u00ad",
  "1 ",
  "ject of colonialism.  But the missionaries still remained banned  from ",
  "entering  India  for another  twenty  years. Despite  the ban,  the mis\u00ad",
  "sionaries  continued  to use various ingenuous  means  to arrive in the ",
  "country and work for the dissemination  of Western education, which ",
  "they believed, would lead to proseylitisation. Thus, while the Protest\u00ad",
  "ant missionaries started  working from the Danish station in Madras ",
  "from the early  eighteenth  century,  the Srirampur  Danish  settlement ",
  "near Calcutta became,  towards the end of the century, the refuge of ",
  "three  Baptist  missionaries:  Dr  William  Carey,  Ward  and  Joshua ",
  "Marshman.  Apart  from running  a printery  and  translating  the Bible ",
  "into local languages,  they also ran schools  for both  boys and girls. ",
  "Unless they directly  offended  the religious sensibilities  of the local ",
  "population,  the  Company's  government  tolerated  such  missionary ",
  "activities,  the  number  of  which  before  1813  was  however  very ",
  "small.2 ",
  "The real beginning of Western education in India can therefore be ",
  "dated  from  the  Charter Act of 1813,  which  not  only  allowed  the ",
  "missionaries to travel to India, but provided for the allocation of one ",
  "hundred  thousand  rupees per  year for two  specific purposes:  first, ",
  "\"the encouragement  of the learned  natives of India and the revival ",
  "of and  improvement  of literature;  secondly,  the  promotion  of a ",
  "knowledge  of  the  sciences amongst  the  inhabitants  of that coun\u00ad",
  "try\"  This was unprecedented  in an age when publicly funded edu\u00ad",
  ".J ",
  "cation was not in vogue even in England.  The immediate concern of ",
  "the Parliament  in forcing the Company into this commitment  was https://telegram.me/UPSCMaterials https://telegram.me/FreeUPSCMaterials https://telegram.me/MaterialforExam",
  "141 ",
  "REFORM  AND  REBELLION ",
  "once  agam  the  corruption  and  degeneracy  of its officials  in India; ",
  "but beyond  that,  there  was also an agenda  for greater  territorial  con\u00ad",
  "trol.  The  officials  rampantly  exploited  the country  as they  viewed  it ",
  "as  a  temporary  territorial  possession,  argued  Charles  Grant.4  So ",
  "greater  commitment  to  the  development  of the  natives  would  pro\u00ad",
  "vide  a greater  sense  of security  or in other  words,  a sense  of duty  to ",
  "the  people  would  lead  to the  development  of a context  for  greater ",
  "consolidation  of  power.  But  this  decision  did  not  immediately ",
  "decide  the  nature  of education  to be provided  for the Indians,  as this ",
  "specific  clause  43 was rather  vague  in its language  and  was open  to ",
  "interpretation.  In official  thinking  in India,  the  Orientalist  thoughts ",
  "were  still powerful,  having  received  strong  support  in a then  recent ",
  "Minute  of Lord  Minto,  the  governor  general  between  1806  and ",
  "1813.  The  new  General  Committee  of Public  Instruction  was  domi\u00ad",
  "nated  by  the  Orienralists,  who  interpreted  the  clause  to  mean ",
  "advancement  of  Indian  classical  literature  and  the  sciences  of the ",
  "land. The  programme  they  chalked  out  was for the establishment  of ",
  "a Sanskrit  College  in Calcutta,  two  more  Oriental  Colleges  at Agra ",
  "and  Delhi  and patronage  for the tols and  madrassas as institutions  of ",
  "indigenous  learning. ",
  "In the  meanwhile,  however,  public attention  in India  was steadily ",
  "being  drawn  away  from  this  tradition  of indigenous  classical  learn\u00ad",
  "ing.  Christian  missionaries  and  European  individuals  like  David ",
  "Hare,  started  opening  schools  in all  parts  of India,  where  English ",
  "became  the  medium  of instruction.  And  then  the  Calcutta  School ",
  "Book  Society  and  later  Calcutta  School  Society  (started  in  1819) ",
  "began  to promote  vernacular  schools  for elementary  education.  The ",
  "tide  seemed  to  shift  decisively  in  the  other  direction  when  Raja ",
  "Rammohun  Roy  sent  a memorandum  to  the  governor  general  pro\u00ad",
  "testing  against  the  founding  of the  Sanskrit  College  in Calcutta.  Roy ",
  "represented  a generation  of Indians  who  believed  that  modernisa\u00ad",
  "tion  of India would  come  through  English education  and the dissem\u00ad",
  "ination  of knowledge  of the  Western  sciences.  The  balance  finally ",
  "tilted  in favour  of the Anglicists  when  William  Bentinck,  a Utilitarian ",
  "reformist,  took  over  as  governor  general  in  1828  and  Thomas ",
  "Babington  Macaulay  was appointed  the  law member  in his council ",
  "in 1834. The  latter  was immediately  appointed  the  President  of the ",
  "General  Committee  of Public  Instruction.  On  2 February  1835  he ",
  "issued  his  famous  Minute  on  Indian  Education,  which  became  the ",
  "blueprint  for  the  introduction  of English  education  in India.  Full of ",
  "contempt  for  Oriental  learning,  Macaulay's  Minute  asserted  that  \"a ",
  "single  shelf of a good  European  library  was worth  the  whole  native https://telegram.me/UPSCMaterials https://telegram.me/FreeUPSCMaterials https://telegram.me/MaterialforExam",
  "142 ",
  "FROM PLASSEY TO PARTITION ",
  "literature  of India and Arabia\".  What  he advocated,  therefore,  for ",
  "the  Indians  was an education  in  European  literature  and  sciences, ",
  "inculcated  through  the medium of English language. Such an educa\u00ad",
  "tion, he argued,  would create \"a class of persons between us and the ",
  "millions  whom  we govern,  a class of persons  Indian  in blood  and ",
  "colour,  but  English in taste,  in opinions,  in morals  and  intellect\" .. s ",
  "Bentinck immediately  endorsed  his proposals in an executive order ",
  "of 7 March  1835, and did not budge from this position  despite loud ",
  "protests  from the Orientalists, Thus, as Sabyasachi Bhattacharya  has ",
  "put it, a new education  system was introduced  in India, in which the ",
  "task  of  producing  knowledge  wa\ufffd assigned  to  the  metropolitan ",
  "country, while its reproduction,  replication  and dissemination  were ",
  "left  for the  colonised  people. 6  This was the  beginning  of the  new ",
  "modernisation  project  for India. ",
  "English education, as Gauri Viswanathan  has argued,  was present ",
  "in India in various forms before  1835. But while previously English ",
  "was studied  in a classical fashion  primarily  as a language,  the  new ",
  "shift  was towards  the  study  of  literature  as a medium  of modem ",
  "knowledge. English literature, it was believed, was an ideal represen\u00ad",
  "tation  of English identity,  sanitised  and  abstracted  from  the  more ",
  "immediate  history  of  exploitation  and  oppression.  Moreover,  it ",
  "would  inculcate an appropriate  training  in morality,  ethics and cor\u00ad",
  "rect  behaviour, and  thus  incorporate  a group  of  natives  into  the ",
  "structure  of colonial  rule,  which  was the  main  political  agenda  of ",
  "Anglicism.7  The major feature of this new English education  policy ",
  "was therefore  the theory of \"downward  filtration\".  It was not meant ",
  "for the masses, but for \"the  rich, the learned,  the men of business\", ",
  "as C.E. Trevalyan described them,  as they already had a literate tra\u00ad",
  "1 ",
  "dition, had eagerness as well as means to learn and above all had suf\u00ad",
  "ficient  leisure.  Once  these  men  were  trained,  they  could  act  as ",
  "teachers  and through  them  elementary  education  would  percolate ",
  "downward  through  regional languages, at much less public expendi\u00ad",
  ".ture. Thus the whole indigenous society would benefit from Western ",
  "knowledge  and superior  moral and ethical ideals. ",
  "The  reports  of William Adam,  recommending  improvement  of ",
  "vernacular  education  through  indigenous  village  schools  were, ",
  "therefore,  ignored  for being  impractical  and expensive.  The  same ",
  "model-of  promoting  English education  and higher education  at the ",
  "expense  of classical and  vernacular learning  as well as elementary ",
  "education-was extended also to the Bombay and Madras  Presiden\u00ad",
  "cies. However, in the North-Western Provinces, Thomason,  an enthu\u00ad",
  "siastic  civilian,  experimented  with  vernacular  elementary  schools https://telegram.me/UPSCMaterials https://telegram.me/FreeUPSCMaterials https://telegram.me/MaterialforExam",
  "143 ",
  "REFORM  AND  REBELLION ",
  "and he was so successful that Lord Dalhousie  later recommended  its ",
  "extension  to Bengal and Bihar. In 1854, Charles Wood's Education ",
  "Dispatch  also  signalled  a similar  shift  away  from  the  downward ",
  "filtration  policy, as it recommended  the extension of vernacular ele\u00ad",
  "mentary education, which was endorsed by Dalhousie's administra\u00ad",
  "tion.  However, even in this shifting focus towards elementary  mass ",
  "education it is not difficult  to see a concern  for the political  econ\u00ad",
  "omy of the empire that rested on the idea of division oflabour.  This ",
  "policy proposed  that while a relatively small group  of highly edu\u00ad",
  "cated Indians would be needed to man the subordinate positions in ",
  "the administration,  the wider population  should  also  have \"useful ",
  "and practical knowledge\" in order to become good workers, capable ",
  "of developing  the  vast  resources  of the  empire, and  also  become ",
  "good  consumers  valuing  the  superior  quality  of British  goods  re\u00ad",
  "quiring a market.  So while elementary and technical education  was ",
  "advocated for the masses, higher education was also given a further ",
  "boost in 1857 through the creation of three universities in Cakutta, ",
  "Bombay and  Madras on  the  model  of the  University  of London, ",
  "which was found to be most suited to colonial conditions. Secondary ",
  "schools, where the medium of instruction was still English,  prolifer\u00ad",
  "ated under the liberal grants-in-aid scheme, with missionary and pri\u00ad",
  "vate Indian  initiatives.  But these schools  were required  to charge ",
  "fees, as free education, it was argued, would not be properly valued. 9 ",
  "The  scheme was replaced  in  1859 by Secretary  of State  Stanley's ",
  "idea of an education  rate;  and vernacular  elementary education suf\u00ad",
  "fered most as a result. ",
  "The Indian Education Commission in 1882 tried unsuccessfully to ",
  "resolve the problem of duality  in the education system by seeking to ",
  "readjust the balance between higher English literary education for a ",
  "few and elementary and  technical education  for  the masses.  \"It is ",
  "desirable\",  its  report  said,  \"that  the  whole  population  of  India ",
  "should  be  literate ... And to ensure  such  general  literacy  it recom\u00ad",
  "mended \"special  funds\" to be set apart particularly for the education ",
  "of backward communities\". 10 Yet, such backward groups as the vast ",
  "community of dalits or the untouchables,  continued to be excluded ",
  "from state schools,  as their  presence would  drive away the higher ",
  "caste pupils, who were meant to be the main target population  for ",
  "the colonial  education  system.  This  exclusion  happened with  the ",
  "active support of the colonial bureaucracy, succumbing in the name ",
  "of practicality  to the  pressures  of the conservative sections of the ",
  "Indian  elite,  many of whom  had by now become  grass-roots  level ",
  "functionaries of the empire.11  British  education policy thus endorsed https://telegram.me/UPSCMaterials https://telegram.me/FreeUPSCMaterials https://telegram.me/MaterialforExam",
  "144  FROM PLASSEYTO  PARTITTON ",
  "and supported  differentiation  in Indian society. By 1885 there was ",
  "in  India,  according  to  B.T.  McCully's  calculation,  \"an  English\u00ad",
  "educated  class of about fifty-five thousand  natives\";'!  but in 1881-",
  "82 out of a total  population  of more than  195 million, only a little ",
  "more than 2 million had attended  elementary  schools.'!  The impact ",
  "of this differentiation  on social and  political  development  of India ",
  "was indeed far-reaching. ",
  "ft was with various motives that English education was introduced ",
  "in India and its continuous  expansion  sustained. For missionaries, it ",
  "was supposed  to  open  the gates for proselyrisation  of the  Indians. ",
  "For Utilitarians  it was the ultimate  fulfillment of Britain's  imperial ",
  "mission;  \"imparting  education  to  natives  is our  moral  duty\", said ",
  "Lord Moira in 1815.14 On the other hand, East India Company  from ",
  "the  beginning of the nineteenth  century  was seeking to reduce  the ",
  "cost of governing  India by Indianising the subordinate  positions  in ",
  "the administrative  structure,  particularly  in the judicial and revenue ",
  "branches.  Manning  the administration  exclusively with Englishmen ",
  "was no longer financially feasible, nor it was politically expedient.  A ",
  "proper  education  in English-\"the  language spoken  by  the  ruling ",
  "class\",  as Macaulay  defined  it-was,  therefore,  a  means  to  train ",
  "them  for such subordinate  public services. However,  speaking  like ",
  "the Englishmen was not enough,  they had to think and behave like ",
  "Englishmen as well. This pedagogic enterprise  of imperialism, there\u00ad",
  "fore,  was to  inculcate  a spirit  of loyalty among  its Indian  subjects ",
  "who would  believe in its providential  nature  and its civilising mis\u00ad",
  "sion. Gauri Viswanathan  has argued that the colonial education  sys\u00ad",
  "tem  deployed  English  literary  studies  in  its  curriculum  as  \"an ",
  "instrument  for ensuring industriousness,  efficiency, trustworthiness, ",
  "and compliance  in native subjects. \"1s But as a moral study it did not ",
  "function  as effectively in India as it did in England,  firstly because ",
  "there  were  not  enough  material  rewards  for  liberal  education  in ",
  "India.  But more  seriously because the educated  Indians  selectively ",
  "adopted  this knowledge and deployed  it to interrogate  colonial rule ",
  "itself (see chapter  4.3 ). So the colonial regime could never abandon ",
  "the policy of using direct  force to uphold  its hegemony, and  main\u00ad",
  "tained  for  this  purpose  elaborate  police  and  army  establishments ",
  "throughout  the  period.  But  its social  control  was  certainly  but\u00ad",
  "tressed, as K.N. Panikkar argues as well, \"by an illusion created  by ",
  "ideological influences\", which always remained  the central concern ",
  "of the  imperial  educational  enterprises.16  The  Indians  who  were ",
  "attracted  to  English education  were  predominantly  Hindu  upper\u00ad",
  "caste  males  from  middle  and  lower  income  groups,  who  were https://telegram.me/UPSCMaterials https://telegram.me/FreeUPSCMaterials https://telegram.me/MaterialforExam",
  "REFORM  AND  REBELLION  145 ",
  "economically  very  hard-pressed due  to changes  of  the  time.  For ",
  "most of them,  education  had a functional utility: it was a means of ",
  "survival in difficult times, a tool for achieving economic prosperity ",
  "and getting power,  rather than just a pathway to intellectual enlight\u00ad",
  "enment.  However,  when that material expectation faltered,  it was ",
  "their knowledge which became their best weapon for confronting  an ",
  "authoritarian  colonial  state,  a story  we will return  to  in the  next ",
  "chapter. ",
  "Protagonists  of English education  like B. T. McCully argued  long ",
  "time ago that \"English education brought the native youth in contact ",
  "with a body ofthought which openly questioned many of the funda\u00ad",
  "mental  assumptions  upon  which  the  fabric  of traditional  values ",
  "rested\".11 More precisely,we may identify this new \"body ofthought\" ",
  "as post-Enlightenment rationalism,  which came to define \"moder\u00ad",
  "nity\" for a select group of educated Indians. They began to look at ",
  "their own society through a prism ideologically constructed by such ",
  "concepts as reason, utility,progress and justice. In 1893 Rabindranath ",
  "Tagore noted  the emergence of a \"public\" in India, which was not ",
  "yet matured, but keen to debate publicly-through their newspapers ",
  "and voluntary associations-e-various  issues affecting the well-being ",
  "of their society. In other words, there was the rise of a civil society, ",
  "though  very limited  it  was, but  articulate  in defending its rights, ",
  "while locating its identity in an Indian tradition.  But this tradition, ",
  "18 ",
  "it was also felt, needed reform,  because within this specific colonial ",
  "ideological context, all existing social practices and religious notions ",
  "appeared  to  be signs of a decadent  feudal  society that had  to  be ",
  "remodelled according  to the values of a bourgeois social order.  In ",
  "other words, 'Enlightenment' seemed to be the \"panacea\" for all the ",
  "evils  and  backwardness that Indians  were  being  blamed  for.\"  for ",
  "this new elite,  striving to move forward  in a new global order intel\u00ad",
  "lectually defined for them by colonialism, \"science\" now became \"a ",
  "universal sign of modernity and progress\" and came to constitute, as ",
  "Gyan Prakash has suggested, an authori tarive \"language of reform\". 20 ",
  "Although  the colonial state would  not provide  scientific education ",
  "for the Indian masses, intellectuals  like Rammohun Roy proposed ",
  "for his countrymen an education  system that would  focus on West\u00ad",
  "ern sciences. In  Calcutta, in 1825,  a Society for Translating  Euro\u00ad",
  "pean  Sciences was  set  up,  followed  by the  establishment  of the ",
  "Society for  the  Acquisition  of General Knowledge in  1838.  This ",
  "movement, which saw the development  of scientific education as the ",
  "key to national  improvement, reached  a major milestone when  the ",
  "Bengali  intellectual Mahendra Lal Sircar  established  in  1876  the https://telegram.me/UPSCMaterials https://telegram.me/FreeUPSCMaterials https://telegram.me/MaterialforExam",
  "146 ",
  "FROM PLASSEY TO PARTITION ",
  "Indian  Association  for  the  Cultivation  of  Science. And  if this  dis\u00ad",
  "course was first started by a small circle of enlightened  Calcutta elite, ",
  "it was soon universalised, as it spread to other  provinces through  the ",
  "development  of a new print culture. In north  India, for example,  the ",
  "Banaras Debating Club founded  in 1861, the Aligarh Scientific Soci\u00ad",
  "ety founded  in 1864 by Sayyid Ahmed Khan and the Bihar Scientific ",
  "Society started  in 1868,  contributed  to this discourse  on the power ",
  "of science, which then began to pervade the new territories  of Hindi ",
  "literary  movements  and Hindu  revivalist campaigns. 21 ",
  "However,  the  problem  was to translate  this scientific  rationalist ",
  "mentality  of an elite into an effective social reform  agenda affecting ",
  "and involving the larger public. This new mentality had first become ",
  "most conspicuous  among  the students  of Henry  Vivian Derozio,  a ",
  "'Eurasian'  teacher  at the Hindu  College in Calcutta,  who developed ",
  "among his pupils a spirit of free thinking.  This controversial  group, ",
  "known  as the Young Bengal, became  notorious  in their  own  times ",
  "for their individual  social rebellion,  manifested  through  wining and ",
  "dining in forbidden  meat. But what was more important  about  them ",
  "was  that  they  posed  an intellectual  challenge  to the  religious  and ",
  "social  orthodoxy  of  Hinduism.  It was  they  who  formed  in  1838 ",
  "the 'Society for the Acquisition of General  Knowledge',  where  they ",
  "discussed various aspects of Wes tern science, and stood for a number ",
  "of social reforms, such as the prohibition  of caste taboos,  child mar\u00ad",
  "riage,  kulin polygamy  or the  ban  on  widow  remarriage.  Yet, they ",
  "could not usher in the desired age of reform.  Their  total faith in the ",
  "British  and  in  English education,  their  rationalism  and  scientism ",
  "derived from the West set them apart  from the masses of Indians and ",
  "they never succeeded in organising any social movement  in support ",
  "of their proposed  reforms. Their professed \"atheism\",  which was so ",
  "avowed  at the initial phase, declined soon,  and  their social radical\u00ad",
  "ism too showed signs of backsliding, as they grew older and became ",
  "established  in society. Thus,  ultimately,  as Sumit  Sarkar concludes, ",
  "the Young Bengal, the followers of Derozio,  \"left little distinctive  or ",
  "permanent  impression  on the plane of religion and philosophy\"  in ",
  "nineteenth-century  India. 22 ",
  "The challenge of the other Indian reformers  of this period  was to ",
  "rediscover reason and science in their own civilisation, and to repo\u00ad",
  "sition  the modernisation  project  within  a cultural  space defined  by ",
  "Indian  tradition.  These  new intellectual  stirrings  created  a reform ",
  "mentality  that  did not reject Indian  tradition,  but sought  to change ",
  "certain  'unreasonable'  aspects of Hindu  society, which  did not con\u00ad",
  "form  to their  new 'rationalist'  image of a glorious  Indian past.  This https://telegram.me/UPSCMaterials https://telegram.me/FreeUPSCMaterials https://telegram.me/MaterialforExam",

  "REFORM AND  REBELLJON ",
  "provided  legitimacy to the reform  agenda of the Utilitarian  reform\u00ad",
  "ers like William Bentinck. But since this mentality was still confined ",
  "to  a small circle of English educated  elite,  the reform  programme ",
  "could hardly be expected  to succeed. Indeed, in the early nineteenth ",
  "century  a series  of social  reforms  followed,  being  mainly  reform ",
  "from  above  through  government  fiat. And as expected,  these  re\u00ad",

  "Wellesley,  for  example,  in  1803  banned  the  religious  custom  of ",
  "23 ",
  "child sacrifice at  Sagar Island in the Bay of Bengal. But although ",
  "this  ritual  practice  was stopped,  the  less visible social  practice  of ",
  "female  infanticide  continued  unabated  in  western  and  northern ",
  "India, where landowning  high-caste families, practising hypergamy, ",
  "found  it difficult  to get suitable grooms  for their  daughters  or pay ",
  "high amounts  of dowry and resorted  to clandestine killing of female ",
  "offsprings  at  the  time  of birth.  The British authorities  sometimes ",
  "tried  to persuade  them,  and after  1830 sought  to  coerce  them  to ",
  "desist from the practice,  with  little  tangible  effect. The  talks  of ",
  "-i ",
  "legal ban were halted by the revolt of 1857, and were kept on hold ",
  "until  1870, when finally the Female Infanticide Act was passed by ",
  "the  Viceroy's  Council.  But even  after  that the  census authorities ",
  "reported  abject neglect of female children,  resulting in high mortal\u00ad",
  "ity that could not be detected  or prevented  by the law.24 ",
  "The greatest achievement that Lord Bentinck is remembered  for is ",
  "the prohibition  of sari or self-immolation  of widows on the funeral ",
  "pyres  of their  dead  husbands.  It was a social practice  prevalent  in ",
  "India  from ancient  times;  but as a modern  researcher  confirms,  it ",
  "\"has  always been very much  the  exception  rather  than  the  rule  in ",
  "Hindu  life\"  During  the Mughal  period,  it was practised  only by ",
  ".2s ",
  "the Rajput princely families in central India and Rajasthan and in the ",
  "kingdom of Vijaynagara in south India. During the British period in ",
  "the lare eighteenth and early nineteenth  centuries,  the practice  was ",
  "revived on a wider scale in areas, which experienced  the highest rate ",
  "of development  under  British administration,  i.e., the  capital  city ",
  "of Calcutta and districts around  it. Here it became popular not only ",
  "among the upper castes, but also among the peasant families of lower ",
  "and  intermediary  castes,  who  achieved  social  mobility  and  then ",
  "sought  to legitimise their new status by imitating  their caste superi\u00ad",
  "26 ",
  "ors.  Apart from this sociological reason and the religious notion  of ",
  "an ideal wife who would follow her husband  in life and in death, the ",
  "ocher factor was the greed of the relatives, which the new prosperity ",
  "of the families had  possibly engendered.  The  practice  had become https://telegram.me/UPSCMaterials https://telegram.me/FreeUPSCMaterials https://telegram.me/MaterialforExam",
  "148  FROM PLASSEY TO PARTITION ",
  "most widespread  in those areas where the dayabbaga school  of per\u00ad",
  "sonal  Hindu  law was applicable.  As  compared  to  the  mitakshara ",
  "school,  it  allowed  the widow  relatively  greater  right  to  inherit  her ",
  "deceased  husband's  property.  Although  the  Christian  missionaries ",
  "had first started  attacking the institution,  it was a strong  abolitionist ",
  "campaign  under  Raja Rammohun Roy that  gave the  movement  its ",
  "real momentum.  Finally, Governor  General Bentinck  prohibited  sari ",
  "in  1829  by a government regulation, which could  not be overturned ",
  "by a Hindu  petition  from the anti-abolitionist  Dharma  Sabha to the ",
  "Pri Council in  1830.  But although  the incidence  of sari declined ",
  "vy ",
  "gradually after the regulation,  the idea and the myth of sati persisted ",
  "in popular culture,  despite the  modernist  critique of the  western\u00ad",
  "educated  middle  classes  and  the  reformist  zeal  of  the  colonial ",
  "administration.  The idea was continually  reaffirmed through epics, ",
  "ballads  and  folktales,  to  reappear  again in public  life as late as in ",
  "1987 in the much publicised sari of Roop Kanwar at village  Deorala ",
  "in Raja sthan. 27 ",
  "Even  more  ineffective  was  the  other  reform  movement  of the ",
  "mid-nineteenth  century that sought  to promote  widow  remarriage. ",
  "Its main  protagonist, Iswarchandra  Vidyasagar,  like his predecessor ",
  "Rammohun  Roy, also looked to the colonial state for a piece oflegis\u00ad",
  "lation. The Hindu Widows' Remarriage Act of 185 6, which legalised ",
  "such  marriages,  could  not  however  make  this  practice  socially ",
  "acceptable.  On the contrary,  as Lucy Carroll has argued,  the legisla\u00ad",
  "tion  was intrinsically  conservative  in  character,  as  on  remarriage  it ",
  "disinherited  the widow of her deceased husband's  property,  and thus ",
  "endorsed  the  Brahmanical  norm  of  rewarding  only  \"the  chaste, ",
  "prayerful  widow\".2s  The  movement  ended  in  what  Vidyasagar's ",
  "biographer  Asoke  Sen  has  called  an  \"unavoidable  defeat\". 29  He ",
  "failed  to see many widows  remarried,  as for that he needed  social ",
  "consent,  which could not be generated by the power of the colonial ",
  "state.  As a  result,  not  only  the  practice  of widow  remarriage  re\u00ad",
  "mained  rare and exceptional  among the educated classes in Bengal, ",
  "but in the next few decades the taboo came to be further universal\u00ad",
  "ised  and  it  became  a  forbidden  practice  even  among  the  lower ",
  "orders.\" ",
  "The situation  was no different  in western  India where  as early as ",
  "1841  an anonymous  Maharashtrian  Brahman  reformer  had  advo\u00ad",
  "cated remarriage  of infant widows as a measure to control their  sex\u00ad",
  "uality  and  make  their  reproductive  capacity  socially  useful.  The ",
  "movement  to promote widow remarriage spread among  the Western ",
  "educated  middle  classes in the 1860s  and  the  debate  between  the https://telegram.me/UPSCMaterials https://telegram.me/FreeUPSCMaterials https://telegram.me/MaterialforExam",
  "REFORM  AND REBELLION  149 ",
  "reformers  and  their  detractors  also  became  harper and  bitter. In ",
  "1866  Vishnushastri  Pandit started a society  for the encouragement ",
  "of widow-remarriage,  while  hi  opponents  also  formed  a  rival ",
  "organisation. In 1870, the reformists suffered a set back when in a ",
  "public debate  in Poona, they were found to be at  fault by Sankara\u00ad",
  "charya  of Kavir  Math  and  many  of them  accepted  the  ritual  of ",
  "penance.  Although  there were  exceptional  widows,  like  Pandita ",
  "Ramabai,  who made her mark in Maharashtrian public life ( more on ",
  "her  in  chapter  7. 5),  the movement  for  the  remarriage  of widows ",
  "ended  in a whimper, as by the end  of the century only  thirty-eight ",
  "widows had  been  remarried  and  in those  cases too,  the couples ",
  "were subjected to enormous social pressure and o tracism. And now, ",
  "the  prohibition  on  widow  remarriage  became  even  more  wide\u00ad",
  "spread, as it became also a lower-caste social  practice, despite  non\u00ad",
  "Brahman social reformer j otirao  Phule' s spirited attacks on enforced ",
  "celibate widowhood.31 ",
  "In the Telugu-speaking  areas of Madras Presidency,  the reform ",
  "movement in support of widow remarriage  was started by Veerasa\u00ad",
  "lingam Panrulu,  who founded in  1878  a Society for Social  Reform ",
  "for this purpose. The first widow  remarriage in the region was offi\u00ad",
  "ciated by him in 1881 in his hometown Rajahmundry, in the face of ",
  "stiff opposition.  Gradually, support for the reform increased and in ",
  "1891 a Widow Remarriage Association was formed with the patron\u00ad",
  "age of the prominent citizens of the town.32 But this enthusiasm not\u00ad",
  "withstanding,  by  this  time  only  three  such  marriages  had  been ",
  "arranged by the reformerS.33  The situation  varied  widely from re\u00ad",
  "gion to region, for in Haryana, where the practice of widow remar\u00ad",
  "riage was already in vogue at a large scale, the new act provided such ",
  "marriages with legitimacy and  further social acceptance.\"  The colo\u00ad",
  "nial legislation  for reform, in other words, had a very uneven impact ",
  "on Indian society. In Bengal,  Vidyasagar continued his reform move\u00ad",
  "ment, directing  it against  polygamy  and  later  child  marriage  and ",
  "finally secured an Age of Consent Act in 1860  chat fixed the age of ",
  "con  ent for the consummation  of marriage at ten years for women. ",
  "le was raised to twelve by another legislation  in 1891  (more details ",
  "in chapter 5.2);  but as census statistics show, child marriage contin\u00ad",
  "ued to be a widely practiced social custom among all the castes, high ",
  "and low alike, well into  the twentieth century. 35 ",
  "Reform  from  above,  more  specifically  through  legislation,  re\u00ad",
  "mained  ineffective in other areas too, where it was directed against ",
  "specific  or organised religious or social practices. The British  con\u00ad",
  "quest  of  the  Deccan  and  central  India  by  the  beginning  of the https://telegram.me/UPSCMaterials https://telegram.me/FreeUPSCMaterials https://telegram.me/MaterialforExam",
  "150 ",
  "FROM  PLASSEY TO PARTITION ",
  "nineteenth  century  created the reformist urge to establish  pax Bri\u00ad",
  "tannica  in  those  unsettled  territories.  But that  became  a  difficult ",
  "proposition as the disbanding of armies by the Indian chiefs and the ",
  "general contraction of job opportunities increased the rate of crime, ",
  "particularly  robbery, by roving armed gangs.  To this was added  the ",
  "official  distrust  for  the  wandering  monastic  orders,  which  chal\u00ad",
  "lenged  the very British  ideal of a settled tax-paying peasant commu\u00ad",
  "nity.  Hence  all these various  peripatetic  groups  were stereotyped ",
  "into a colonial construct,  called  thugs, who  were believed  to  have ",
  "been members of a \"fraternity\"  traditionally  involved  in robbery and ",
  "ritual killings in the name of religion. The campaign against  thugee ",
  "was initiated in the 1830s  in assertion of the same humanitarian  mis\u00ad",
  "sion  of British  paramountcy  championed  by  Lord  Bentinck.  The ",
  "purpose  of the campaign, as Radhika Singha has argued, was not to ",
  "root it out through education  or regeneration of the indigenous soci\u00ad",
  "ety;  the \"Thuggee\" Act  (XXX) of 1836  and  the Thuggee  Depart\u00ad",
  "ment were simply aiming at policing and prosecuting gangs seen as ",
  "perpetrating  a crime in the name of religion.  But it proved to be a ",
  "difficult  ta k.  In  1839,  Sir  William  Sleeman,  the  architect  of  the ",
  "campaign,  claimed  that thuggee  as an  organised  system  had  been ",
  "exterminated.  In reality what happened  was that he realised the dif\u00ad",
  "ficulty  of prosecuting  various  groups of peripatetic  mendicants  on ",
  "charges of thuggee.  He therefore preferred to try more flexible strat\u00ad",
  "egies for policing  such communities.36 ",
  "Legalistic reforms were even  more ineffective against less visible ",
  "or  less  organised  social  customs  that  remained  parts  of peoples' ",
  "everyday culture  for centuries. An ideal example of this was the abo\u00ad",
  "lition  of slavery  in  1843.  Slavery  had been  abolished  in Britain  in ",
  "1820,  and in  India the colonial  administrators  continued  to detect ",
  "its existence in various  forms. The agrarian  relations in India were ",
  "complex,  marked  by numerous structures  of labour  dependencies, ",
  "many of which, viewed  through the post-Enlightenment  \"lens of the ",
  "freedom-unfreedom  opposition\";\"  looked  like  slavery  in  British ",
  "eyes. The Charter Act of 1833,  therefore, instructed the government ",
  "of India to abolish slavery,  and parliamentary  pressure continued to ",
  "mount until  its legal abolition.  But since the actual forms of bondage ",
  "differed,  particularly  so  far as agrestic  slavery  was concerned,  the ",
  "impact  of the legal  ban was also very limited.  Caste, customs  and ",
  "debt kept the agricultural  labourers bonded to their landlords  in var\u00ad",
  "ious ways and for a very long  time to come. ",
  "It is interesting  to note that women's status became the main focus ",
  "of  the  reforming  activities  of  the  colonial  state  as  well  as  of the https://telegram.me/UPSCMaterials https://telegram.me/FreeUPSCMaterials https://telegram.me/MaterialforExam",
  "REFORM  AND  REBELLION  151 ",
  "educated Indians. To a large extent it was the result of a comparative ",
  "civilisational discourse of the colonial  period. In other words, when ",
  "civilisations were ranked,  one of the major criteria  was the position ",
  "of women, and it was here that the Indians  were increasingly  under ",
  "attack by the Western observers,  from missionaries  to civilians.  To ",
  "put it differently, Indian civilisation was despised because it assigned ",
  "such a low status to women. This gender question was a key issue for ",
  "James Mill condemning Indian civilisation in his The History of Brit\u00ad",
  "ish  lndia.3B  So  the  Indian  intelligentsia  al o  responded  to  this ",
  "civilisational  critique by advocating and supporting  reforms to im\u00ad",
  "prove the status of women  in Indian society. Such  reforms, as we ",
  "have seen, affected only a few women belonging to their own classes ",
  "and  that too  in  a very  restricted  way,  as  these  women  remained ",
  "recipients of male  patronage  and  never  became involved  in  these ",
  "reformist projects as conscious  subjects  of their  own  history.  This ",
  "early nineteenth-century public discourse on reform  thus not only ",
  "had limited impact on society as a whole,  it also signified  the patriar\u00ad",
  "chal  control of the educated Indian males over the private sphere or ",
  "the domestic arena  reserved for women.39  It is simplistic to suggest ",
  "that the  great  reformers  of  the nineteenth  century  were  not  con\u00ad",
  "cerned about the weI fa re  of women;  but the reforms were not just ",
  "for women,  and we will return  to this topic in a short while. ",
  "Another response  of the educated  Indian  elite to such  civilisa\u00ad",
  "tional critiques  was to reform Hinduism from within  in the light of ",
  "post-Enlightenment  rationalism.  This  phenomenon  is often  cele\u00ad",
  "brated  in the  older historiography  as the \"Bengal  Renaissance\"  or ",
  "the \"Nineteenth  Century Indian Renaissance\".  Although the use of ",
  "the term \"renaissance\"  is problematic, this cultural movement essen\u00ad",
  "tially involved attempts to discover  rationalism  in India's past and ",
  "thus to reposition her religious  and philosophical traditions  within ",
  "the critical terrain of reason. The movement was started  in Bengal ",
  "by Raja Rammohun  Roy  who  is often  described  as the  father  of ",
  "modem  India. He was one of those upper-caste gentry whose power ",
  "and  position  had  been  enhanced  by the Permanent  Settlement  and ",
  "other  opportunities  opened up  by colonial  rule.  Rammohun  im\u00ad",
  "bibed  rationalism  from his early  training in the eighteenth-century ",
  "Perso-Arabic literature.  Eventually, he studied Vedantic monism and ",
  "after his migration  to  Calcutta in  1815  was exposed  to  Christian ",
  "Unitarianism.  Such intellectual  influences motivated him to contest ",
  "the missionary claim of superiority of Christianity; his answer was to ",
  "reform Hinduism in the light of reason, by going back to its purist ",
  "form  as enshrined  in  the  Vedanta texts.  He  condemned  idolatry, https://telegram.me/UPSCMaterials https://telegram.me/FreeUPSCMaterials https://telegram.me/MaterialforExam",
  "152 ",
  "FROM PLASSEY TO PARTITION ",
  "priestcraft  and polytheism and translated  the Upanishads into Bangla ",
  "to demonstrate  that ancient Hindu scriptures themselves propagated ",
  "monotheism. \" ",
  "Roy's  first organisation,  Atmiya Sabha,  founded  in  Calcutta  in ",
  "1815,  eventually took the shape of Brahmo Samaj in 1828.  It emer\u00ad",
  "ged  as a  major  religious  movement  of  the  middle-class educated ",
  "Bengalis,  based  on  the  essential  principle  of  monotheism.  After ",
  "Roy's death  in 1833,  the leadership  of the Brahmo movement  was ",
  "taken  over by Debendranath  Tagore  who  provided  the movement ",
  "with a berter organisational  structure and ideological consistency.41 ",
  "But the movement  was actually  taken  out of the limited elite circles ",
  "of  Calcutta  literati  into  the  district  towns of east  Bengal  by Bijoy ",
  "Krishna  Goswami and Keshub Chandra  Sen in the 1860s. Goswami ",
  "bridged the gap between Brahmoism  and the popular religious tradi\u00ad",
  "tion  of Vaishnavism,  while Sen's  specific  focus was to reach larger ",
  "numbers of non-Westernised Bengalis in the eastern  Gangetic plains ",
  "and  to  take  the  movement  outside  Bengal  to  other  provinces  of ",
  "India.42 ",
  "If missionary  activities had been one major contribution  of Keshub ",
  "Sen to the Brahmo movement,  the other contribution  was a renewed ",
  "artenrion  to social reforms.  He brought in some amount of radical\u00ad",
  "ism into the movement,  by attacking caste system, by focusing on the ",
  "question of women's rights,  by promoting widow  remarriage and ",
  "inter-caste marriages,  and by raising the issue of caste status of the ",
  "Brahmo  preachers, a position  hitherto  reserved  for the Brahmans ",
  "alone.  But  this  radicalism  also  brought  the  first  rift  within  the ",
  "Brahmo  movement.  BasicalJy,  as Meredith  Borthwick has shown, it ",
  "was a schism between Keshub's  followers,  for whom  social progress ",
  "and reform were more important than anything else, and the follow\u00ad",
  "ers of Debendranath,  who preferred to maintain  their identification ",
  "with Hindu sociery.?  The former  in  1866  established  their  Brahmo ",
  "Samaj of India, while  the latter sought  to retain their identity  under ",
  "the rubric of Adi (o  riginal) Brahmo Samaj. These developments sig\u00ad",
  "nified the perennial  dilemmas of Indian modernisation,  which con\u00ad",
  "tinuously  sought to be rooted in Indian traditions.  This rift was, as it ",
  "became clear soon, more about an identity crisis than about any fun\u00ad",
  "damental  difference  of ideology: while  some of the Brahmos wanted ",
  "to define  themselves as separate  from the Hindus, others  began  to ",
  "seek a position  within the great tradition of Hinduism. ",
  "The crisis deepened  and the  chasm  expanded  when  the Brahmo ",
  "Marriage  Act  was passed in  1872;  it  legalised  Brahmo  marriages, ",
  "which  allowed  inter-caste  and  widow  marriage,  but  only  if  the https://telegram.me/UPSCMaterials https://telegram.me/FreeUPSCMaterials https://telegram.me/MaterialforExam",
  "REFORM  AND  REBELLION  153 ",
  "contracting  parties  declared  themselves  to  be  non-Hindus.  As  a ",
  "result, the act never became  very popular.  Sen himself  later  retreated ",
  "from  his radical  position,  condemned  the act for  promoting  \"God\u00ad",
  "less marriages?\"  and  later  came  closer  to the  Hindu  ascetic  Rama\u00ad",
  "krishna  Paramahansa.  This  gradually  led  to  another  rift  in  the ",
  "Brahmo  Samaj  in  1878.  When  Sen  arranged  the  marriage  of his ",
  "minor  daughter  with  the  Maharaja  of  Cooch  Bihar,  his  followers ",
  "parted  company  and  formed  the  Sadharan  Brahmo  Samaj.  In 1881 ",
  "Sen  formed  his Naba  Bidhan  (New  Dispensation)  and  started  mov\u00ad",
  "ing towards a new universalist  religion.  But  by this time  successive ",
  "ideological  rifts  and  organisational  divisions  had  weakened  the ",
  "Brahmo  movement,  confining  it to a small  elite  group. And then  it ",
  "succumbed  to a neo-Hindu  aggressive  campaign  for  \"revivalism\", ",
  "rather  than \"reformism\",  as a bold assertion  of Hindu  identity  vis-a\u00ad",
  "vis the West  (more  in chapter  5.2). ",
  "In western India, reformism  began  in the early  nineteenth  century ",
  "in two different  ways. One was the Orientalist  method  of exploring ",
  "and translating  ancient  Sanskrit  texts and rediscovering  in them  the ",
  "glories  of Indian  civilisation.  The  most  notable  cholar-reformers ",
  "involved  in this project were  KT. Telang, V.N. Mandalik  and  above ",
  "all,  Professor  R.G.  Bhandarkar.\"  The  other  trend  was  represented ",
  "by the  more  direct  method  of social  reform  attacking  such  institu\u00ad",
  "tions as caste system  or  prohibition  of widow  remarriage.  This  was ",
  "undertaken  by  a  number  of  individuals  like  Mehtaji  Durgaram ",
  "Mancharam,  Karsondas  Mulji,  or  Dadoba  Pandurang,  who  were ",
  "involved  in  organisations  like  Manav  Dharma  Sabha,  founded  in ",
  "1844,  or  the  Paramhansa  Mandali,  founded  in  1849.  The  latter ",
  "organisation  followed  the  iconoclastic  radical  tradition  of  the ",
  "Derozians  in Bengal;  but in order  to avoid  any  frontal confrontation ",
  "with the wider  community,  they operated  like a secret society.  Reve\u00ad",
  "lation  of  its  membership  in  1860,  therefore,  quickly  led  to  its ",
  "demise,  leaving  very little  achievement  to its credit 46  However,  in ",
  "the  meanwhile,  We stem  education  had  made  headway  in  Maha\u00ad",
  "rashtra and  the  Gujarat  region,  creating  a critical  core group looking ",
  "for reform.  In such  a context,  the two visits  of the  Bengali  Brahmo ",
  "missionary  Keshub  Chandra  Sen to Bombay  in 1864 and  1867  had  a ",
  "profound  impact  Indeed,  as  a  direct  consequence  of  that,  the ",
  "Prarthana  Samaj  (Prayer  Society} was  founded  in Bombay  in  1867. ",
  "Although  its  founder  president  was  Atrnaram  Pandurang,  the  real ",
  "spirit  behind  it was Mahadev  Gobind  Ranade,  who was ably assisted ",
  "by Bhandarkar  and  N.G.  Chandavarkar.  K.T. Telang,  who  attended ",
  "the samaj  services regularly, never became a member. All the leading https://telegram.me/UPSCMaterials https://telegram.me/FreeUPSCMaterials https://telegram.me/MaterialforExam",

  "personalities in this new organisation were W estem educated Mara\u00ad",
  "thi  Brahmans. As  for its philosophy,  like the  Brahma  movement, ",
  "the Prarthana  Samaj also preached  monotheism, denounced  idola\u00ad",
  "try,  priestly  domination  and  caste distinctions. Later it developed ",
  "a  syncretism  and  connected  itself  to  the  Maharashtrian  bhakti ",
  "tradition.\" ",
  "The Prarthana Samaj  maintained its distinction  from the Brahmo ",
  "movement of Bengal. The most  notable distinction  was in its cau\u00ad",
  "tious approach  in contrast to  the  relatively  confrontational ",
  "more ",
  "attitudes of the Bengali Brahmos. \"The peculiar feature of the move\u00ad",
  "ment  in  [Bombay] Presidency\",  Ranade pointed out, was that its ",
  "goal was \"not to break with the past and cease all connection  with ",
  "our society\".\"  The reforms it sought  were to come gradually, not ",
  "cataclysmically, wrecking the structure  of  the  society. Modernisa\u00ad",
  "tion,  in other words, was to be accommodated within  the cultural ",
  "space  of  tradition,  without  signalling  a  sharp  break  It  was  this ",
  "gradualist  approach, which  made  Prarthana  Samaj relatively more ",
  "acceptable  co the larger  society. Branches were  opened  in Poona, ",
  "Surat, Ahmedabad,  Karachi,  Kirkee, Kolhapur  and Sarara.  Its activi\u00ad",
  "ties also spread  to south  India  where  the movement  was led by the ",
  "Telugu  reformer  Veerasalingam Panrulu,  By  the  beginning  of the ",
  "twentieth century, there were eighteen  branches in the Madras Presi\u00ad",
  "dency.  But on the other hand, this  cautious  approach  also brought ",
  "49 ",
  "the Prarthana  Samaj  face to face with its first crisis. In 187 5 Swami ",
  "Dayanand  Saraswati visited Gujarat  and Maharashtra and  offered ",
  "the possibilities of a more radical  and self-assertive religious  move\u00ad",
  "ment.  A group  of Samaj  members,  under the  leadership  of  S.P. ",
  "Kelkar, felt  attracted  to  the  Swami's  Aryan  ideology,  and  broke ",
  "away. Although the dissident  group  later came back to the  fold  of ",
  "Prarrhana  Samaj,  this marked  the beginning  of a different kind  of ",
  "religious politics in western India, which was marked  more by cul\u00ad",
  "tural chauvinism than reformism. ",
  "This rupture in the tradition of reform came through  the religious ",
  "movement starred by Swami Dayanand Saraswati,  who founded  his ",
  "Arya Samaj in 1875. Dayanand invoked the authority  of the Vedas as ",
  "the most authentic  Indian  religious  texts, and sought  to purge Hin\u00ad",
  "duism  of all  its post-Vedic accretions. It  is difficult  to  ignore the ",
  "Western  Orientalist touch in his discourse that tried to project Hin\u00ad",
  "duism as a \"religion  of the book\", like Christianity and Islam.\"  But ",
  "what is  important,  in his aggressive response  to the West, he ",
  "more ",
  "fully appropriated the Western intellectual discourse of reason and ",
  "science and deployed them against his adversaries. He claimed that https://telegram.me/UPSCMaterials https://telegram.me/FreeUPSCMaterials https://telegram.me/MaterialforExam",
  "REFORM  AND  REBELLION  J 55 ",
  "the Vedas alone contained \"scientific truths\", and therefore,  the reli\u00ad",
  "gion based on these texts was superior  to Christianity and  Islam. 51 ",
  "On the authority  of the Vedas, he attacked idolatry, polytheism,  rit\u00ad",
  "ualistic  religion  dominated  by  the  Brahman  priests,  condemned ",
  "child  marriage  and  stood  for  widow  remarriage,  inter-caste  mar\u00ad",
  "riages and female education.\" Interestingly, these were the reforms ",
  "that the  Western  reformers  were  advocating!  He  also  denounced ",
  "untouchabiliry, and  repudiated caste system (for  more  on  this see ",
  "chapter 7.2); but at the same time, he upheld the fourfold vama divi\u00ad",
  "sion, thus retaining  the core of the Indian social organisation.s3 His ",
  "aggressive reformism  failed to  convince  the  orthodox  Hindus, or ",
  "even the Brahmas, and remained  marginal in eastern  and  western ",
  "India;  but  it  received  warm  acceptance in Punjab and  the North\u00ad",
  "Western Provinces. At the time ofhis death in 1883 there were Arya ",
  "Samaj  branches all over this region  and  it  was from  this time  on ",
  "that the movement became more and  more popular and also  more ",
  "aggressive. The moderates among his disciples, who chose to focus ",
  "on  education  and  community  work,  were gradually  marginalised ",
  "after  1893,  while  a  militant  group  under  Pandit Guru  Dutt and ",
  "Pandit Lekh Ram launched  a militant campaign for preaching  the ",
  "religion  of the  Vedas,  attacking  the  Muslims  and  retrieving  lost ",
  "ground by initiating suddhi or reconversion  of those who were lost to ",
  "the three  proselytising religions of Christianity, Sikhism  and  Islam. ",
  "And then in the 1890s, the Arya Samaj  became  intensely involved in ",
  "the cow-protection movement, thus moving decisively from reform\u00ad",
  "ism to revivalism, a topic that we will return to in chapter  5. ",
  "What needs to be focused here though are some of the special fea\u00ad",
  "tures  of these social and  religious  reform  movements  of the  nine\u00ad",
  "teenth  century, which  made  such  transformation  possible.  These ",
  "movements, first of all, had  remained  confined to a narrow  social ",
  "space,  as the  reformist  spirit  appealed  only to a small  elite group, ",
  "who were primarily the economic and cultural beneficiarie  of colo\u00ad",
  "nial  rule.  In Bengal,  the  reform  movement  involved  only  a small ",
  "number  of Western educated elite who were known by the general ",
  "term  bbadralok  (gentlefolk). These were the \"new  men\"  who had ",
  "made money as junior partners of the English officers and free mer\u00ad",
  "chants, consolidated  their position  as small landholders under Per\u00ad",
  "manent  Settlement and later took advantage of English education  to ",
  "fill in the  various  new  professions and subordinate administrative ",
  "positions.  Socially, they were mostly Hindus,  and though  caste was ",
  "not a major criterion  for membership, most of them belonged to the ",
  "three  higher castes, Brahman,  Kayastha and Baidya.54 The Brahmo https://telegram.me/UPSCMaterials https://telegram.me/FreeUPSCMaterials https://telegram.me/MaterialforExam",
  "156  FROM PLASSEYTO PARTITION ",
  "movement  was almost exclusively  patronised  by these  groups,  and ",
  "although  it spread  from Calcutta to district towns and to other prov\u00ad",
  "inces, it remained  alienated  from the masses. The  reformers  never ",
  "even  tried  to  take  the  reform  to  the  people,  as  the  language  of ",
  "reform, the chaste Sanskritised  Bengali prose of RammohunRoy for ",
  "example,  remained  incomprehensible  to  the  uneducated  peasants ",
  "and  artisans.P  Similarly  in  western  India,  the  members  of the ",
  "Prarthana Samaj  were the English educated  Chirpavan and Saraswat ",
  "Brahmans, some Gujarati merchants and a few members of the Parsi ",
  "communiry.f  In  1872 the Samaj  had only sixty-eight members  and ",
  "about  150-200 sympathisers.\"  And in  Madras Presidency,  where ",
  "English education  made much slower progress and caste domination ",
  "of the Brahmans  remained  unshaken,  the reform ideas took longer ",
  "to appear. 58  Indeed,  the general  high caste character  of the reform ",
  "movements oft he early nineteenth century explains to a large extent ",
  "the relative  silence on the caste question.  Untouchabiliry  as an issue ",
  "of social reform had to wait until  the beginning of the twentieth cen\u00ad",
  "tury and  the arrival of Mahatma Gandhi in Indian  public life after ",
  "World War One (more on this in chapter  7.2).  Lacking in a broad ",
  "social base, the reformers  of the early nineteenth  century thus exhib\u00ad",
  "ited  an intrinsic  faith  in the benevolent  nature  of colonial  rule and ",
  "relied  more on  legislation  for imposing  reform from above. There ",
  "was very little  or no attempt to create a reformist social conscious\u00ad",
  "ness at the grass-roots level,  where  religious revivalism  later found a ",
  "fertile ground. ",
  "Equally important  is the colonial  character of the reforms,  as the ",
  "Indian  reformers'  positions in a significant  way mirrored  the colo\u00ad",
  "nial mind and therefore  also the ambivalence  of the colonial  policy ",
  "planners.  The  dominant  colonial  assumption  of the  time  was that ",
  "religion was the basis of Indian society and this religion was encoded ",
  "in the scriptures. This colonial perception  assumed a total submis\u00ad",
  "sion of the indigenous  society to the dictates of the scriptures. Social ",
  "evils were thought  to be the results of distortion of scriptures by self\u00ad",
  "seeking people,  in this case the cunning  Brahman  priests  who  had ",
  "a monopoly  over this textual  knowledge. The civilising mission  of ",
  "the colonial  state was thus seen to lie in giving back to the natives ",
  "the truths of their own little read and even less understood shastras. ",
  "Lara, Mani  (1998)  has argued  that the whole debate  over sari was ",
  "grounded in scriptures:  the colonial  government decided  to prohibit ",
  "it only when it was convinced  that the custom  was not enjoined  by ",
  "the scriptures.  As the colonial  rulers gave supreme importance to ",
  "scriptures,  the  Indian  reformers  too,  as well  as their detractors, https://telegram.me/UPSCMaterials https://telegram.me/FreeUPSCMaterials https://telegram.me/MaterialforExam",
  "157 ",
  "REFORM  AND  REBELLION ",
  "referred to ancient religious texts to argue their respective cases. The ",
  "brutality or the irrationality of the custom,  or the plight of women, ",
  "whom the reform was intended for, were lesser concerns in a debate, ",
  "which  was more  on  the  definition of tradition.  In Mani's  words, ",
  "\"women  are neither  subjects nor objects but,  rather, the ground  of ",
  "the discourse  on sati;  ...  women  themselves are  marginal  to the ",
  "debate\".s9  The  same  thing  can  be  said  of  the  debate  on  widow ",
  "remarriage.s? and later,  on  the prohibition of female infanticide.61 ",
  "The  scriptures,  lately valorised  by the  Orientalists, thus provided ",
  "legitimacy for social  reforms  and  women  were  denied  agency  in ",
  "their  own emancipation  (more discussion  on  the women's  isses in ",
  "chapter  7.5). ",
  "This brings us to the inner tensions  of colonial modernity, as it is ",
  "not proper to say that the Indian reformist discourses  just reflected ",
  "some colonial formulations. The early writings  of Rammohun  Roy ",
  "are indeed  full of \"humanistic pleas\" to ameliorate  the conditions  of ",
  "Indian womanhood.62 He talked of scriptures when advocating  the ",
  "abolition  of sari, as that was how he could sell his reform to a cau\u00ad",
  "tious colonial government  and to a reticent Hindu  society reluctant ",
  "to  accept  change.  But  this  traditionalism  notwithstanding,  his ",
  "\"clinching  arguments\",  as  Tapan  Raychaudhuri  has  pointed  out, ",
  "\"anticipate[ d]  the idiom and stances of contemporary  feminism\". 63 ",
  "Roy's  rationalism  was indeed  pre-colonial.  In his early writings  in ",
  "Persian  he  had  taken  a  totally rational  approach  to  religion  that ",
  "nearly amounted  to a negation  of religion  itself However, after his ",
  "contact with  Christianity  and  Western free-trade  thinking  in Cal\u00ad",
  "64 ",
  "cutta, he became more moderate  or perhaps  more ambivalent.  One ",
  "has to admit that a sharp  tradition/modernisation  dichotomy  is not ",
  "intellectually  conducive to understanding  the process of reform  in ",
  "nineteenth-century  India. 65 The perceptible ambivalence in the posi\u00ad",
  "tion of the reformers was clearly the outcome of a colonial  context. ",
  "Against the claims of a totalising  influence of the colonial discourses, ",
  "one  may point  out that no  hegemony  is  ever that absolute  that it ",
  "allows no space for autonomy. Although Indian  modernisers looked ",
  "towards  the  colonial  state  for  support  and  direction  and  post\u00ad",
  "Enlightenment  rationality shaped  their visions, they could  neither ",
  "leave their  tradition,  nor  forget  their  Indian  identity.  The  Indian ",
  "modernisation  project  therefore  always felt a compulsion  to con\u00ad",
  "struct  a  modernity  that  would  be  located  within  Indian  cultural ",
  "space. To summarise their position  in Christophe jaffrelot's words, ",
  "they \"undertook  to reform their society and its religious practices in ",
  "order to adapt them to Western modernity  while preserving the core https://telegram.me/UPSCMaterials https://telegram.me/FreeUPSCMaterials https://telegram.me/MaterialforExam",

  "of Hindu  tradition. \"66  It was through  this project  that the  cultural ",
  "essence  of  Indian  nationhood,  its difference  from  the  colonising ",
  "West,  were gradually imagined  by the  Indian intelligentsia.  How\u00ad",
  "ever,  the inherent  ambivalence or tensions within this cultural enter\u00ad",
  "prise later  made it appear weak and  rendered  it vulnerable  to the ",
  "more aggressive assertion of tradition  in the late nineteenth  century. ",
  "This later cultural movements too, as we shall see, were involved in a ",
  "complex  intellectual  project  of interrogating  and  adjusting  at the ",
  "same time to the colonial constructs of Indian tradition. ",
  "3.2.  PEASANT AND  TRIBAL UPRISINGS ",
  "When the elites of the Indian society were busy in initiating religious ",
  "and social reforms to change their society from within to answer the ",
  "moralistic critiques  of the West, the rural society was responding  to ",
  "the imposition of colonial rule in an entirely different way. In con\u00ad",
  "trast to the urban intelligentsia, who were also the chief beneficiaries ",
  "of colonial  rule, the  response  of the traditional elite  and  the peas\u00ad",
  "antry,  who  were losing  out as a result  of colonial  impositions,  was ",
  "that of resistance  and  defiance,  resulting  in a series of unsuccessful ",
  "attempts  at  restoring  the old  order.  Not  that  peasant  revolts  were ",
  "unknown  in Mughal India;  indeed, they became endemic in the first ",
  "half of the eighteenth century as the rising revenue demands breached ",
  "the Mughal compromise  and affected the subsistence  provisions  of ",
  "the  peasants, and the Mughal  provincial  bureaucracy became ever ",
  "more oppressive and rigorous in collecting it (c hapter  1.1). The ten\u00ad",
  "dency became  even  more pervasive  as the colonial  regime estab\u00ad",
  "lished  itself, enhanced  its power and introduced  a series of revenue ",
  "experiments,  the sole purpose of which was to maximize its revenue ",
  "income. Resistance to  colonial  rule was therefore as old as  the rule ",
  "itself ",
  "In the late eighteenth  and early nineteenth  centuries the revenue ",
  "reforms of the Company's government  had fundamentally affected ",
  "and altered  the Indian rural society. To get an overview  of this new ",
  "structure  we may  follow  the general  model  developed  by Daniel ",
  "Thorner and  D.N.  Dhanagare,67 allowing of course,  possibilities of ",
  "variation  in different regions. The first group in this model consisted ",
  "of landlords  holding  proprietary  rights over  large estates,  usually ",
  "consisting  of several  villages.  They were  an  absentee rentier  class ",
  "with  little  or no  interest  in land  management  or improvement  of ",
  "agriculture.  The second group consisted of rich peasants, who  could ",
  "again be subdivided  into  two subgroups, i.e.,  the  rich  landowners ",
  "and  rich tenants. The first group held proprietary right in land,  but https://telegram.me/UPSCMaterials https://telegram.me/FreeUPSCMaterials https://telegram.me/MaterialforExam",
  "REFORM  AND  REBELLION  159 ",
  "usually in the same village and took personal  interest  in cultivation, ",
  "it not actually participated  in it. The rich tenants, on the other hand, ",
  "had substantial  holdings,  enjoyed security of occupancy rights and ",
  "paid nominal rents to their landlords.  The third group  consisted  of ",
  "middle peasants, who could again be subdivided  into:  (a}  landown\u00ad",
  "ers of medium-size  holdings  or self-sufficient  peasants  who  culti\u00ad",
  "vated with  family  labour  and  (b) tenants  with  substantial  holdings ",
  "paying  higher  rents than  the other  privileged  tenants.  The  fourth ",
  "group  included  the poor peasants, i.e.,  the landowners  with small ",
  "holdings not sufficient to maintain their families, tenants with small ",
  "holdings with little or no tenurial  security and the sharecroppers or ",
  "tenants at will. The last or fifth group, according to Dhanagare, con\u00ad",
  "sisted of the landless labourers. ",
  "The structure described above is, however, an arbitrary classifica\u00ad",
  "tion  based  on  production  relationship  and  not  all  the  categories ",
  "could be seen in all the regions. More generally,  it was a pyramidal ",
  "agrarian society, with 65 to 70 per cent of the agricultural  popula\u00ad",
  "tion being non-owners  of land. These complexities  of the agrarian ",
  "social structure  actually developed  more  fully  in the late nineteenth ",
  "century rather than in the pre-1857  phase. During  the latter period, ",
  "very  broadly,  to  follow  David  Hardiman's  taxonomy,  the  Indian ",
  "agrarian society could be fitted into three categories: the rural mag\u00ad",
  "nates who were gradually building on their power as landlords,  the ",
  "rich peasants or peasant farmers and the poor  peasants.6s It is often ",
  "argued that the rich or the middle peasantry, being more independ\u00ad",
  "ent,  were always potentially  the more  radical  elements  to iniriate ",
  "and  sustain  peasant  rebellions.  But in  the late eighteenth  or early ",
  "nineteenth-century  India,  the  land  reforms  and  the  high revenue ",
  "demands of the Company's  government had so severely affected the ",
  "entire rural population  that all sections of the peasantry in different ",
  "parts of the country participated  in a series of violent protests.  So ",
  "here we will talk about \"peasants\" -rather  than  any finer divisions ",
  "among them-who  rose against the Company  and all chose who ",
  "Raj ",
  "stood for it or beneficed from it. ",
  "During the  first century of British  rule there were,  first of all,  a ",
  "series of uprisings  which  Kathleen  Gough  has called  \"restorative ",
  "rebellions\",  as they were started  by disaffected local rulers, Mughal ",
  "officials  or dispossessed  zamindars.  In  most  cases they were  sup\u00ad",
  "ported by the local peasants, whose primary goal was to reinstate the ",
  "old order or restore the existing agrarian relations. One could men\u00ad",

  "Ali ",
  "into  the  1830s,  particularly  in the  northern  and  southern  parts  of ",
  "Awadh, causing problems for the revenue collectors. Then  followed ",
  "a rebellion of the Bundela Rajput chieftains in 1842, disrupting  agri\u00ad",
  "culture  and endangering  trade routes  in the region for few years. In ",
  "the south,  in the Tirunelveli  district  of North  Arcot and  the  ceded ",
  "districts  of Andhra,  between  1799 and  1805  the  Madras  govern\u00ad",
  "ment faced stiff resistance from the local chiefs called the poligars. ",
  "While  the  Company's  government  treated  them  as just  zamindars ",
  "holding military service tenures,  in local peasant societies they were ",
  "regarded  as sovereigns inheriting  power from the pre-Muslim  Vijay\u00ad",
  "nagara kingdom.  So when they put up resistance to the Company's ",
  "troops,  they  were  openly  supported  by the  local peasant  societies ",
  "70 ",
  "and were even treated  as folk heroes.  Also in the south,  there  was ",
  "the  revolt  of Pazhassi Raja which  rocked  Malabar  in  1796-1805, ",
  "followed  by the insurrection  of Velu Thampi,  the prime minister  of ",
  "the Travancore  state, who commanded  a large army of professional ",
  "soldiers  and  peasant  volunteers.  All these  armed  rebellions  were, ",
  "however,  put down eventually by the British army.  In some cases the ",
  "rebels  were  later  reinstated  with  more  lenient  revenue  terms.  But ",
  "more generally, they were suppressed with what Gough calls \"exern\u00ad",
  "plary savagery\". 71 ",
  "The  peasants  themselves  often  on  their  own  initiative  offered ",
  "resistance  to  British  rule.  The  Rangpur  rebellion  of  1783  in  the ",
  "northern  districts  of Bengal is an ideal example  of such opposition. ",
  "In  the  early  days  of  revenue  farming  system,  the  peasantry  was ",
  "oppressed  by the revenue contractors  and company  officials, impos\u00ad",
  "ing high  revenue  demands  and  often  collecting  illegal cesses. The ",
  "worst offenders were revenue contractors  like Debi Singh or Ganga\u00ad",
  "gobinda  Singh, who had unleashed a reign of terror  in the villages of ",
  "Rangpur and Dinajpur districts. The peasants initially sent a petition ",
  "to  the  Company's  government  asking for  redress.  But when  their ",
  "appeal  for  justice  went  unheeded,  they  organised  themselves, ",
  "elected  their  own  leader,  raised a huge army, equipped  themselves ",
  "with  primitive  bows,  arrows  and  swords  and  attacked  the  local ",
  "cutchery  (a court  of law), looted  grain stores and  forcibly released ",
  "prisoners.  Both Hindu and Muslim peasants fought side by side and ",
  "stopped  paying revenue. The rebels sought to legitimise their  move\u00ad",
  "ment by invoking what  Sugara Bose has 'called \"the  symbols of the ",
  "pre-colonial  state system\". They called their leader \"nawab\",  started ",
  "their own government  and levied charges to meet the costs of their ",
  "movement.  On  Debi  Singh's  appeal,  the  Company's  government https://telegram.me/UPSCMaterials https://telegram.me/FreeUPSCMaterials https://telegram.me/MaterialforExam",

  "\u2022 ",
  "under  Warren  Hastings  sent troops  to  put  down  the  rebellion.  Its ",
  "brutal  suppression  was, however,  followed  by some reforms  in the ",
  "revenue  farming system. 11  Similarly in the south,  the final overthrow ",
  "of Tipu Sultan and reinstatement  of the old ruling dynasty of Mysore ",
  "brought  in enhanced  revenue  demands  that  fell ultimately  on  the ",
  "peasants. Rampant extortion  by corrupt  officials further  aggravated ",
  "their desperate  situation,  motivating  them  to rise in open  rebellion ",
  "in 1830-31  in the  province  of Nagar.  Here  too  the  rebels elected ",
  "their own leaders, defied the authority  of the Mysore rulers and ulti\u00ad",
  "mately bowed down to the advancing British troops. ",
  "In many of the peasant movements  of this period,  religion played ",
  "an important  role  in providing  a discursive field within  which  the ",
  "peasants  understood  colonial  rule and conceptualised  resistance.  In ",
  "other  words,  their  religion  defined  their  ideology  of protest.  The ",
  "earliest  of these was the  Sanyasi and Fakir rebellion,  which  rocked ",
  "northern  Bengal and adjacent areas ofBihar between 1763 and 1800. ",
  "The Dasnami Sanyasis, known for their martial tradition,  were invol\u00ad",
  "ved in landholding,  moncylencling and trade in raw silk, piecegoods, ",
  "broad cloth, copper and spices. The Madari Fakirs, who traced their ",
  "origin  from the  Sufi order  initiated  by Sha-i-Madar,  enjoyed  rent\u00ad",
  "free tenures  and retained  armed  followers during  the Mughal  days. ",
  "Both these groups of armed wandering  monks were affected by the ",
  "Company's  high revenue demands,  resumption  of rent-free  tenures, ",
  "and  commercial  monopoly.  And  then,  their  ranks  were  inflated ",
  "by the  sufferers  from  the  famine  of 1769-70,  a large  number  of ",
  "aggrieved  small zamindars,  disbanded  soldiers  and  the  rural  poor. ",
  "The  remarkable  philosophical  affinity  between  the  two  religious ",
  "orders,  their  mutual  relationship,  organisational  network  and com\u00ad",
  "munication  with  the  followers,  facilitated  mobilisation  of  the  re\u00ad",
  "bels. 73  However,  what  made  the  conflict  inevitable  was  the  Com\u00ad",
  "pany-state's  unwillingness  to  tolerate  such  wandering  bands  of ",
  "armed monks, who would seriously challenge its cherished ideal of a ",
  "settled  peasant  society in Bengal that  would  regularly  pay revenue ",
  "without  resorting  to  resistance. 11  Therefore,  from  the  beginning ",
  "of  the  17 60s  until  the  middle  of 1800s  recurrent  confrontations ",
  "between  the  Sanyasi-Fakirs  and  the armed  forces of the  East India ",

  "number  of participants  rose up  to  fifty thousand  at  the  height  of ",
  "insurgency, which 'however  began to  decline  after  1800.  But soon ",
  "another  movement  developed  in the  Sherpur  pargana  of Mymen\u00ad",
  "singh district  in east Bengal, where Karim Shah and later his succes\u00ad",
  "sor  Tipu  Shah  started  a  new  religious  movement  among  the https://telegram.me/UPSCMaterials https://telegram.me/FreeUPSCMaterials https://telegram.me/MaterialforExam",

  "pany's  rule  consolidated  itself  in  this  region  and  the  zamindari ",
  "system became more firmly entrenched under the Permanent  Settle\u00ad",
  "ment,  the  peasants'  grievances  rose  against  the  illegal  abwabs ",
  "exacted  by the zamindars and the new revenue  settlement  effected ",
  "by  the  Deputy  Collector  Dunbar.  In such  circumstances,  around ",
  "1.824 Tipu's  Pagalpanthi  sect held out  a promise  of a new  regime ",
  "and just rents. The new spirit  gradually spread over the whole region ",
  "and  took  the  shape  of an  armed  insurrection,  which  had  to  be ",
  "crushed with the help of the army in 1833.1s ",
  "Simultaneously in  another  part  of Bengal  a religious  movement ",
  "called  Tariqah-i-Muhammadiya  was developing  under  the  leader\u00ad",
  "ship  of Tiru Mir.  Starring his  career  as a hired  muscleman  for the ",
  "local zarnindars, he later  went to Mecca, and was initiated  by Sayyid ",

  "area in the northern  part  of the district  of 24 Parganas on both sides ",
  "of the rivers Jumna and lchhamati. His followers came mainly from ",
  "the poor  Muslim peasants and weavers, who were organised into a ",
  "community  with  distinctive  dress and beard  as markers  of identity. ",
  "As this  self-assertion  of  the  peasantry  challenged  the  established ",
  "relations  of power, the local zamindars  tried  to curb them in various ",
  "ways, by imposing, for example, a tax on beard. Tiru Mir and his fol\u00ad",
  "lowers  defied  the  existing authority-as  represented  by the  local ",

  "Around  the  same  time,  another  religious  movement  called  the ",

  "purify  Islam  by purging all  un-lslamic  beliefs and  practices  and  by ",
  "signifying Koran as their sole spiritual  guide. The importance of this ",

  "A similar peasant  movement of the 1840s and  1850s where reli\u00ad",
  "gion played an important role was the Moplah uprising in the Mala\u00ad",
  "bar  region  of  south  India.  The  Moplahs  (o  r  Mappilas)  were  the ",
  "descendents  of Arab traders who had settled  in this region and had ",
  "married  local Nair  and  Tiyar  women.  Later  their  ranks  inflated ",
  "through  conversion  of lower  caste Hindus  like the  Cherumars,  a ",
  "slave caste whose emancipation  under  the  Slavery Abolition  Act of ",
  "1843  had  put them  in  greater  social  problems. \u2022o  Gradually  the ",
  "Moplahs  became  dependent  on agriculture  and turned into a com\u00ad",
  "munity  of cultivating  tenants,  landless labourers,  petty traders and ",
  "fishermen.  When  the  British  took  over  Malabar  in  1792,  they ",
  "sought to  revamp the land  relations by creating individual  owner\u00ad",
  "ship right in land. The traditional  system stipulated an equal sharing ",
  "of the net produce of the land by the  (holder  of  ten\u00ad",
  "janmi  [anmam ",
  "ure),  the Kanamdar  or Kanakkaran  (holder  of kanam  tenure)  and ",
  "the cultivator. The British system upset this arrangement  by recog\u00ad",
  "nising the janmi as absolute owners of land, with  right  to evict  ten\u00ad",
  "ants, which did not exist earlier, and reduced other two categories to ",
  "the  status  of  tenants  and  leaseholders.  Apart  from  that,  over\u00ad",

  "Muslim Moplahs. Within  this social matrix,  the traditional  Muslim ",

  "and his son Sayyid Fazal Pookkoya Tangal of Mamburam  and Sayyid ",
  "Sana-Ullah-Makti  Tangal,  played an important  role in revitalising a ",
  "popular  ideological domain where religion and economic grievances ",
  "intermingled  to  produce  a mentality  of open  resistance.  Mosques ",
  "became the centres of mobilisation  and the targets  were the Hindu ",
  "janmi,  their temples and the British officials who came to their  res\u00ad",
  "cue. Three serious incidents occurred  in Manjeri in August 1849,  in ",
  "Kulathur in August 1851-both  in south Malabar-and  in Mattannur ",
  "in the  north  in January  1852.  British armed  forces were  deployed ",
  "to suppress  the  revolt. The  repressive  measures  restored  peace  for ",
  "about twenty years, but then the Moplahs  rose again in 1870 and the ",
  "events  followed  a similar trajectory  (see chapter  4.2). ",
  "Some of  the  peasant  rebellions  in pre-1857  India  were  partici\u00ad",
  "pated exclusively by the tribal population  whose political autonomy ",
  "and  control  over  local resources  were  threatened  by the  establish\u00ad",
  "ment  of  British  rule  and  the  advent  of its  non-tribal  agents.  The ",
  "Bhils, for example, were concentrated  in the hill ranges of Khandesh ",
  "in the previous  Maratha  territory.  British occupation  of this region ",
  "in 1818 brought  in the outsiders  and accompanying  dislocations  in ",
  "their community life. A general Bhil insurrection in 1819 was crushed ",
  "by the British military forces and though some conciliatory  measures ",
  "were  taken  to  pacify them,  the  situation  remained  unsettled  until ",
  "1831 when the Ramoshi leader Umaji Raje of Purandhar  was finally ",
  "captured  and executed. The Bhils' local rivals for power, the Kolis of ",
  "Ahmadnagar  district,  also challenged  the British in 1829,  but were ",
  "quickly subdued  by a Large army contingent. The  seeds of rebellion ",
  "however  persisted,  to  erupt  again  in  1844-46,  when  a local  Koli ",
  "leader  successfully defied  the  British government  for  two  years. 83 ",
  "Another  major tribal revolt, the Kol uprising of 1831-32,  took place ",
  "in Chota Nagpur  and Singbhum region of Bihar and Orissa. In these ",
  "areas, they used to enjoy independent  power for centuries.  But now ",
  "British penetration  and imposition  of British law posed  a threat  to ",
  "the  power  of  the  hereditary  tribal  chiefs.  And the  Raja of Chota ",
  "Nagpur  started  evicting tribal peasants by farming  out land to out\u00ad",
  "siders for higher  rents. This settlement  of non-tribals  and constant ",
  "transfer of land to merchants and moneylenders-generally  referred ",
  "to as the sud or outsiders-led  to a popular uprising, as their plea for ",
  "justice failed to  move the  authorities.  The  forms of rebellion  con\u00ad",
  "sisted  of attacks  on  the  properties  of the  outsiders,  but  not  their ",
  "lives. Plunder  and  arson,  in other  words,  were  the chief modes  of https://telegram.me/UPSCMaterials https://telegram.me/FreeUPSCMaterials https://telegram.me/MaterialforExam",

  "rebellion  \"wiped  off the  Raj from  Choto  Nagpore  in a matter  of ",
  "weeks\".\"  The British army had to move in to quell the disturbances ",
  "and restore  order. ",
  "The most effective tribal movement  of this period was, however, ",
  "the Santhal hool (rebellion) of 1855-56. The Santhals lived scattered ",
  "in various  districts  of Curtack,  Dhalbhum,  Manbhum,  Barabhum, ",
  "Chota  Nagpur,  Palamau,  Hazaribagh,  Midnapur,  Bankura  and ",
  "Birbhum in eastern India. Driven from their homeland,  they cleared ",
  "the area around  the Rajmahal Hills and called it Damin-i-koh.  They ",
  "were gradually  driven  to a desperate  situation  as tribal  lands were ",
  "leased out to non-Santhal zamindars  and moneylenders.  To this was ",
  "added  the oppression  of the local police and the European  officers ",
  "engaged  in railroad  construction.  This penetration  of outsiders\u00ad",
  "called  dikus  by the  Santhals-completely  destroyed  their  familiar ",
  "world,  and  forced them  into action  to take possession of their  lost ",
  "territory.  In July  1855, when  their ultimatum  to the zamindars  and ",
  "the  government  went  unheeded,  several thousand  Santhals,  armed ",
  "with  bows  and  arrows,  started  an  open  insurrection  \"against  the ",
  "unholy trinity of their oppressors-the  zamindars, the mahajans and ",
  "the government\". 85  The  insurrection  spread  rapidly  and  in a wide ",
  "region between Bhagalpur and Rajmahal the Company's  rule virtu\u00ad",
  "ally collapsed,  spreading  panic in government  circles. At this stage ",
  "the  Santhal rebels were also being actively helped  by the low caste ",
  "non-tribal  peasants.  This  invited  brutal  counter-insurgency  mea\u00ad",
  "sures;  the army was mobilised and Santhal villages were burnt  one ",
  "after another  with vengeance. According to one calculation,  out of ",
  "thirty to fifty thousand  rebels, fifteen to twenty thousand were killed ",
  "before  the  insurrection  was  finally  suppressed. 16  Henceforth,  the ",
  "British  government  became  more  cautious  about  them  and  the ",
  "Santhal inhabited areas were constituted  into a separate  administra\u00ad",
  "tive unit, called the Santhal Parganas, which recognised the distinc\u00ad",
  "tiveness .oftheir tribal culture and identity. ",
  "The peasant rebellions described above are only the more promi\u00ad",
  "nent ones in a long list of other  similar movements  that  took  place ",
  "across the subcontinent.  Any generalisation  about  their origins and ",
  "nature is risky. Yet,in a very broad sense it can be said that the chang\u00ad",
  "ing economic  relations in the colonial period contributed  to peasant ",
  "grievances  and  their  anguish  found  expression  in  these  various ",
  "rebellions. Indian peasant economy in pre-colonial  period was based ",
  "on a subsistence ethic. The peasants did not bother  about how much ",
  "was taken away from them;  in an environment  of scarcity they were https://telegram.me/UPSCMaterials https://telegram.me/FreeUPSCMaterials https://telegram.me/MaterialforExam",
  "166 ",
  "FROM  PLASSEY TO PARTITION ",
  "happy  if they were left with enough  provision  for their basic needs. ",
  "The  pre-colonial  Mughal  compromise,  as described  earlier  ( chap\u00ad",
  "ter 1), broke  down  in the eighteenth  century,  as surplus  extraction ",
  "became more vigorous.  This affected  the peasants'  subsistence  pro\u00ad",
  "visions and resulted  in recurrent  peasant  revolts;  the colonial  reve\u00ad",
  "nue  system  only  strengthened  that  process.  But  there  was  more ",
  "change than continuity  in the colonial agrarian economy,  as we have ",
  "seen  in  the  previous  chapter.  Colonial  endeavour  to draw  Indian ",
  "economy  into  the world  capitalist  system and  attempts  to develop ",
  "capitalist  agriculture  had  in  many  cases a  devastating  impact  on ",
  "agrarian  relations.  Creation  of  property  right  in  land  and  conse\u00ad",
  "quently  of a land market  resulted  in the replacement  of customary ",
  "production  relationship  with contract. With the growth  of commer\u00ad",
  "cialisation,  tribute  was gradually replaced  by profit  as the dominant ",
  "mode  of surplus  extraction;  but the process  of transformation  was ",
  "never complete. As tribute and profit continued  to exist side by side, ",
  "the  net result was the breakdown  of all familiar  norms  of agrarian ",
  "relations. ",
  "The  colonial  rule  resulted  in what  Ranajit  Guha  has called  the ",
  "\"revitalization  of landlordism \". 87  Due  to  the  changes  in property ",
  "relations,  the  peasants  lost their  occupancy  right  and  were  turned ",
  "into tenants-at-will,  which meant a great transformation  in their sta\u00ad",
  "tus. Not until  1859  the  British government  looked  at the  tenancy ",
  "issue and did anything to protect  their  rights. The high land revenue ",
  "demand  of the state could  therefore  easily be passed on to the peas\u00ad",
  "ants;  the  corrupt  practices  and  the harsh  attitudes  of the  revenue ",
  "officials added  to  their  miseries.  The  landlords'  power  to oppress ",
  "the  peasants  was greatly  expanded  by  British  law.  Their  military ",
  "power was not actually curbed and continued  to be exerted  through ",
  "the zamindar-daroga  nexus, while the  new courts  and  the  lengthy ",
  "judicial  processes  added  further  to  their  coercive  authority.  The ",
  "landlords came to be looked at as agents of oppression,  protected  by ",
  "the  state;  grievances  against  the  landlord  therefore  turned  easily ",
  "against  the British as well. The  landlords  were  more  interested  in ",
  "extraction  rather  than  in  capitalist  enterprise,  as  they  too  were ",
  "under  constant  pressure  of the sunset  laws and  the burden  of high ",
  "revenue  demand  of the state.  The  development  of land  market  re\u00ad",
  "sulted in a growing rate of land alienation  and what accentuated  the ",
  "process  was the  new credit  nexus.  The  high Land revenue  demand ",
  "increased the peasants'  need for credit and that enhanced  the power ",
  "of the moneylenders  and merchants  over the rural society. Growing ",
  "indebtedness  led  to  eviction  from  land,  which  passed  on  to  the https://telegram.me/UPSCMaterials https://telegram.me/FreeUPSCMaterials https://telegram.me/MaterialforExam",
  "167  ",
  "REFORM  AND REBELLION ",
  "hands of the non-cultivating  classes. In the words  of Ranajit  Guha, ",
  "the landlords,  moneylenders  and the state thus came to constitute  \"a ",
  "811 ",
  "composite  apparatus  of dominance  over the peasant\". ",
  "The  tribal  peasants  had  some  special  reasons  to be aggrieved. ",
  "They  lived at the periphery  of the  settled  Hindu  peasant  societies ",
  "and enjoyed autonomy  of culture, which was based on an egalitarian ",
  "ethos.  Over the period,  their gradual  Hinduisarion  had been bring\u00ad",
  "ing them under the oppression  of the ritual hierarchy;  and then the ",
  "extension  of  the  British  land  revenue  system  fully destroyed  the ",
  "autonomy  of the tribal world. They were drawn into the larger eco\u00ad",
  "nomic  nexus,  as the tribal  lands passed into  the hands  of the  non\u00ad",
  "tribal oppressive agents-the  zamindars and the moneylenders.  And ",
  "the new forest regulations appeared as encroachments  on their natu\u00ad",
  "ral rights. The imposition of British rule, in other words,  resulted  in ",
  "the loss of their  autonomous  domains  of power,  freedom  and  cul\u00ad",
  "ture. The destruction  of their imagined golden past by the intruding ",
  "outsiders-the  suds and dikus-led  obviously to violent outbursts. ",
  "These  peasant  and  tribal  uprisings  of  the  early  colonial  period ",
  "have been  looked  at in different  ways. The  British administration ",
  "considered  them as problems of law and order;  the rebels were por\u00ad",
  "trayed  as primitive  savages resisting  civilisation.  The  nationalists ",
  "later on tried  to appropriate  the peasant and tribal histories  for the ",
  "purposes  of anti-colonial  struggle  and  projected  them  as the  pre\u00ad",
  "history of modem  nationalism.  Eric Stokes, the historian,  would call ",
  "them  \"primary  resistance,  that is, a traditional  society's  act of vio\u00ad",
  "lent defiance, from which usually follows the imposition  of colonial ",
  "rule  in response\".\"  Others  like D.N.  Dhanagare  would  regard  the ",
  "peasant  rebellions as \"pre-political\",  because of their lack of organi\u00ad",
  "sation, programme  and ideology.90 Ranajit Guha, on the other  hand, ",
  "has argued that \"there was nothing in the militant movements of ... ",
  "[the] rural masses that was not political\".\" ",
  "The rebellions that we have described previously were not apoliti\u00ad",
  "cal acts; they constituted political action that demonstrated,  although ",
  "in  different  ways, the  political  consciousness  of the  peasantry.  As ",
  "Ranajit Guha  (1994)  has shown,  they exhibited,  first of all, a clear ",
  "awareness of the relations of power in rural society and a determina\u00ad",
  "tion  to overturn  that  structure  of authority.  The  rebels were  quite ",
  "conscious of the political sources of oppression,  and this was dern\u00ad",
  "oustrared  in  their  targets  of  attack-the  zamindars'  houses,  their ",
  "grain stocks,  the  moneylenders,  the  merchants  and  ultimately  the ",
  "state machinery of the British, which came forward  to protect  these ",
  "local agents of oppression. A clear identification  of the enemies was https://telegram.me/UPSCMaterials https://telegram.me/FreeUPSCMaterials https://telegram.me/MaterialforExam",
  "168 ",
  "FROM  Pl.AsSEYTO  PARTITION ",
  "matched  by an equally clear marking  of the friends. What we often ",
  "find in these peasant rebellions is a redefinition  of the relationship  of ",
  "the oppressed  to the language, culture and religion of the dominant ",
  "classes,  although  the  protests  took  myriad  forms.  The  rebellions ",
  "were political action,  different  from crime,  because they were open ",
  "and public. The Santhals gave ample warning  in advance;  the Rang\u00ad",
  "pur leaders imposed a levy for insurrection  on the peasantry.  There ",
  "were public conferences,  assemblies, and planning  which definitely ",
  "spoke of a programme.  There  were grand ceremonies  of rebel mar\u00ad",
  "ches. The public character  was reinforced by drawing on the corpo\u00ad",
  "rate labour activity, as the Santhals characterised  the rebel actions as ",
  "their  traditional  hunting  activity;  but  now  hunting  had acquired  a ",
  "new political  meaning. ",
  "As for the leadership of these peasant rebellions,  it came from the ",
  "ranks  of the rebels themselves.  Since the  leaders  belonged  to  the ",
  "same cultural world of the peasants and tribals whom they led, they ",
  "could  provide  more  effective  leadership.  The  mobilisation  took ",
  "place along community  lines, an exception  being the Rangpur  upris\u00ad",
  "ing. The colonial rural societies experienced  varying degrees of ten\u00ad",
  "sion  between  class, caste,  ethnic  and  religious groups,  which  were ",
  "articulated  in a violent  condition  of oppression  and  poverty  in the ",
  "countryside.  Religion  in  many  cases  provided  the  bond  of unity ",
  "among  the  poorer  classes and the  leaders  were  the holy  men who ",
  "promised  a  new  milJennium  to  be achieved  through  supernatural ",
  "means. 92 In pre-capitalist  societies, where class-consciousness  was ill ",
  "developed  and class ideology absent,  religion provided  an ideology ",
  "for rebellion. The holy leaders referred to the loss of a moral world ",
  "and thus expressed  the anxieties of the peasants in religious idioms. ",
  "Religion thus provided  legitimacy to their movements.  In such revo\u00ad",
  "lutionary  messianism,  the  charismatic  leaders  were  thought  to  be ",
  "endowed  with  magical power;  their empowering  was thus an act of ",
  "God. The rebellion was therefore  divinely ordained  and legitimised ",
  "through  reference  to a higher authority. This provided  both  an ide\u00ad",
  "ology as well as motivation  for peasant action. These peasant  rebel\u00ad",
  "lions  also  differed  from  modem  nationalism.  The  spread  of  the ",
  "rebellion  depended  on the rebels' own perception  of space and eth\u00ad",
  "nic  boundary;  it  was  most  effective  within  the  geographical  area ",
  "within  which that community  lived and worked.  The  Santhals'  bat\u00ad",
  "tle, for example, was for their 'fatherland';  but sometimes ethnic ties ",
  "extended  across the territorial  boundaries,  as in Kol insurrection  we ",
  "find the Kols of different  regions rose in revolt simultaneously. The ",
  "rebels'  own  perception  of  time  played  a  significant  role  as well. https://telegram.me/UPSCMaterials https://telegram.me/FreeUPSCMaterials https://telegram.me/MaterialforExam",

  "There  is  often  an  evocation  of  history  in  the  conception  of  a ",

  "Apart from the more organised  movements  described earlier, vio\u00ad",
  "lent armed  rebellions, social banditry  or general \"lawlessness\" were ",
  "endemic  in  the  first  century  of British  rule  in  India.  Indeed,  the ",

  "ent collaborators  often nurtured  sense of disaffection  and hatred  for ",
  "the  alien  rulers.  The  Calcutta  bhadralok,  for  example,  who  had ",

  "94 ",

  "against the monopolistic  activities of the grain dealers and interven\u00ad",
  "tionist British officials took place in western Hindustan  and Delhi in ",

  "mid-eighteenth century respected  the traditions  and customs of the ",
  "indigenous  communities and  a high  caste identity of the army was ",
  "deliberately  encouraged.  This was particularly  true  of the Bengal ",
  "army, which had a predominantly  high caste character,  mainly  con\u00ad",
  "sisting  of  Brahmans,  Rajputs  and  Bhumihars,  whose  caste  rules, ",
  "dietary  and  travel  restrictions  were scrupulously  respected  by the ",
  "army  admirusrration,  under  instructions  from  Warren  Hastings. ",
  "However,  from the 1820s  things  began to change,  as army  reforms ",
  "were initiated  to introduce a more universalised military culture. As ",
  "the reforms in the 1820s and 1830s sought  to establish a tighter con\u00ad",
  "trol over the army administration  and began to curtail  some of the ",
  "caste privileges  and  pecuniary  benefits, there were acts of resistance, ",
  "which  continued into the 1840s  (for details on the army, see chapter ",
  "2.4). These incidents  prepared  the backdrop  for the mutiny of 1857, ",
  "the early  signals  of which could  be detected  in late January  when ",
  "rumours  started  circulating  among  the  sepoys  in  Oum  Oum  near ",
  "Calcutta that  the  cartridges of the  new  Enfield  rifle,  lately  intro\u00ad",
  "duced  to  replace  the old  'Brown  Bess'  musket,  had  been  greased ",
  "with cow and pig fat. Since the cartridges had to be bitten off before ",
  "loading, it confirmed  the sepoys' old suspicion about a conspiracy  to ",
  "destroy  their  religion  and caste and convert them  Christianity.  The ",
  "cartridge rumour,  which was not entirely devoid of truth,  spread  like ",
  "wildfire  in various  army  cantonments  across the country.  Although ",
  "the  production  of  those  cartridges  was stopped  immediately  and ",
  "various  concessions were offered to allay their fears, the trust that ",
  "had been breached could never be restored.  On 29 March in Barack\u00ad",
  "pur near Calcutta, a sepoy with the name of Mangal  Pande fired at a ",
  "European  officer  and  his  comrades  refused  to  arrest  him  when ",
  "ordered  by their  European superiors. They were soon apprehended, ",
  "court  martialled and hanged  in early April, but  the disaffection  of ",
  "the sepoys could  not be contained.  In the  following  days,  incidents ",
  "of disobedience,  incendiarism  and  arson  were  reported  from  the https://telegram.me/UPSCMaterials https://telegram.me/FreeUPSCMaterials https://telegram.me/MaterialforExam",
  "REFORM  AND  REBELLION  1 71 ",
  "army cantonments  in Ambala, Lucknow  and Mcerut,  until  finally, ",
  "the Meerut  sepoys started the revolt on 10 May. They rescued their ",
  "arrested  comrades  who  had previously  refused  to  accept  the  new ",
  "cartridge,  killed  their  European  officers  and  proceeded  to  Delhi, ",
  "where  on  11  May  they  proclaimed  the  ageing  Mughal  emperor ",
  "Bahadur  Shah Zafar  the  Emperor  of Hindustan. '1  From  Delhi the ",
  "uprising  soon  spread  to other  army centres  in the North-Western ",
  "Provinces and Awadh and soon took the shape of a civil rebellion, as ",
  "disgruntled  rural  population  lent a helping hand.  On  19 June  Lord ",
  "Canning,  the  despondent  governor  general,  wrote:  \"In  Rohilcund ",
  "and the Doab from Delhi to Cawnpore  and Allahabad the country is ",
  "not only in rebellion against us, but is utterly lawless\".\" ",
  "The mutiny mainly affected the Bengal army; the Madras  and the ",
  "Bombay  regiments  remained  quiet,  while  the  Punjabi and  Gurkha ",
  "soldiers  actually  helped  to  suppress  the  rebellion.  It should,  how\u00ad",
  "ever, be remembered  that maximum  number  of Indian sepoys were ",
  "in the Bengal regiment and if we look at total  numbers,  almost half ",
  "of the Indian sepoys of the East India Company  had rebelled.\"  The ",
  "composition  of the Bengal army was much to blame, as it had mini\u00ad",
  "mal British military  presence,  which  later was  considered  to  be a ",
  "capital error. Moreover,  the high-caste background  of the sepoys in ",
  "the Bengal army, mostly recruited  from Awadb, gave them a homo\u00ad",
  "geneous character. They were nurturing  for a long time a number of ",
  "grievances:  their religious beliefs had lately come into conflict with ",
  "their  new  service conditions;  their  salary  level dropped;  they  suf\u00ad",
  "fered discrimination  in matters of promotion  and pension.  To make ",
  "matters  worse,  in 1856 a set of new service rules were introduced, ",
  "which abolished their extra allowance for service outside  their own ",
  "regions.  Service abroad  was considered  to  be prejudicial  to  their ",
  "caste rules, but expansion  of the British empire made that unavoid\u00ad",
  "able. Their refusal to serve in Burma, Sind or Afghanistan met with ",
  "reprisals and dismissal. ",
  "To the  discontent  with  service conditions  was added  a constant ",
  "fear that  the  British were determined  to convert  them  into  Chris\u00ad",
  "tianity. The presence of missionaries, the rumours about mixing cow ",
  "and  pig  bone  dust  with  flour  and  finally  the  controversy  about ",
  "the  cartridge  for  Enfield  rifles-all  fitted  nicely into  a conspiracy ",
  "theory.  The  annexation  of Awadh  in 1856  had  a special  adverse ",
  "effect on the morale of the Bengal army, as about seventy-five thou\u00ad",
  "sand of them were recruited  from this region.  Sir James Outram  had ",
  "already cautioned Dalhousie that \"every agricultural family in Oudh, ",
  "perhaps  without  exception,  ..  .  sends one of its members  into  the https://telegram.me/UPSCMaterials https://telegram.me/FreeUPSCMaterials https://telegram.me/MaterialforExam",

  "FROM  PLASSEY TO P ARmION ",
  "British  army\" .100  The  annexation  of Awadh  shook  the  loyalty  of ",
  "these sepoys, as it was for them an ultimate  proof of untrustworthi\u00ad",
  "ness of the British. Moreover,  as sepoys were peasants  in uniform, ",
  "they were anxious  about  the declining conditions  of the  peasantry ",
  "due to the summary settlements  in Awadh. The revolt was preceded ",
  "by about  fourteen  thousand  petitions  from  the  sepoys  about  the ",
  "hardships  relating  to the  revenue  system.'?'  In other words,  it was ",
  "not  just because  of the  \"cartridge\"  that  the  sepoys  threw  in their ",
  "gauntlet  and rose in open rebellion  against the British. ",
  "ltis much more difficult to explain the civjlian revolt that accom\u00ad",
  "panied  the  mutiny.  As colonial  rule  had  a differential  impact  on ",
  "Indian  society, the  latter's  responses  were  also widely  variegated. ",
  "First of all, regions  and  people  who  were  beneficiaries  of colonial ",
  "rule did not revolt. Bengal and Punjab remained  peaceful;  the entire ",
  "south India remained  unaffected  too. On the other hand,  those who ",
  "revolted  had two  elements  among  them-the  feudal  elements  and ",
  "the big landlords  on the one end and the peasantry on the other. Dif\u00ad",
  "ferent  classes had different  grievances and the nature  of. grievances ",
  "also varied from region to region. So far as the feudal elements were ",
  "concerned,  their major grievance was against the annexations  under ",
  "Lord  Dalhousie's  'Doctrine  of  Lapse'  which  derecognised  the ",
  "adopted  sons of the  deceased princes  as legal heirs and their  king\u00ad",
  "doms were annexed. In this way, Satara (1848), Nagpur,  Sambalpur ",
  "and  Baghat (1850),  Udaipur  (1852)  and jhansi (1853)  were  taken ",
  "over  in quick succession. This amounted  to British interference  in ",
  "the traditional  system of inheritance  and created a group of disgrun\u00ad",
  "tled  feudal  lords  who  had  every  reason  to join  the  ranks  of the ",
  "rebels. Finally, in February  1856 Awadh was annexed  and the  king ",
  "was deported  to Calcutta. The annexation  did not merely affect the ",
  "nawab and his family, but the entire aristocracy attached  to the royal ",
  "court. These deposed princes in many cases offered leadership to the ",
  "rebels in their respective regions and thus provided  legitimacy to the ",
  "revolt.  Thus,  Nana  Sahib, the  adopted  son of Peshwa Baji Rao  II, ",
  "assumed  leadership  in Kanpur,  Begum Hazrat  Mahal  took  control ",
  "over  Lucknow,  Khan  Bahadur  Khan  in  Rohilkhand,  and  Rani ",
  "Lakshmibai appeared  as the leader of the sepoys in Jhansi,  although ",
  "earlier she was prepared  to accept British hegemony  if her adopted ",
  "son  was  recognised  as the  legitimate  heir  to the  throne.  In other ",
  "areas of central  India, where there  was no such dispossession,  like ",
  "Indore,  Gwalior,  Saugar  or parts  of Rajasthan,  where  the  sepoys ",
  "rebelled,  the princes remained  loyal to the British. ",
  "The  other elements  of rural  society that joined  the  ranks  of the ",
  "rebels were the landed  magnates or the taluqdars.  The annexation  of https://telegram.me/UPSCMaterials https://telegram.me/FreeUPSCMaterials https://telegram.me/MaterialforExam",

  "REF0-1 AND REBELLION ",
  "Awadh  was followed  by a summary  settlement  in 1856,  which  led to ",
  "the dispossession  of a number  of powerful  taluqdars.  The settlement ",
  "was made  with  the actual occupiers  of the land  or village  coparcen\u00ad",
  "aries  to the disregard  of all other proprietary  rights,  in the same way ",
  "as it was done  a little while ago in the North-Western  Provinces.  The ",
  "prime  motive  was to gain popularity  among the agricultural  popula\u00ad",
  "tion and get rid of the unwanted  middlemen  who  stood between  the ",
  "peasants  and  the  government.  As a result,  in Awadh  the  taluqdars ",
  "lost  about  half  of their estates;  they were  disarmed  and  their  forts ",
  "demolished,  resulting  in a considerable  loss  of status  and  power  in ",
  "local society.  In the eyes of law they were  now  no different  from the ",
  "humblest  of their renanrs.l\"'  Awadh,  therefore,  became  the  hotbed ",
  "of  discontent  of  the  landed  aristocrats  and  so  was  the  North\u00ad",
  "Western  Provinces,  where  coo many  taluqdars  had lately  been  dis\u00ad",
  "possessed.  As the revolt  started,  these taluqdars  quickly  moved  into ",
  "the  villages  they had  recently  lost,  and  significantly,  they  faced  no ",
  "resistance  from their  erstwhile  tenants.  Bound by  ties of kinship  and ",
  "feudal  loyalty,  as  Thomas  Metcalf  has  argued,  the  villagers  were ",
  "happy  to  acknowledge  the  claims  of their  lords  and  joined  hands ",
  "against  their  common  enemy,  the British.'?' ",
  "The peasants  joined  the  rebellion  because  they too were  hard  hit ",
  "by the inordinately  high  revenue  demands  of the state.  In A wadh  for ",
  "example,  the  revenue  assessment  overall  was  reduced,  but  there ",
  "were  pockets  of over-a  sessmenr,  and  here  the  taluqdars'  losses  re\u00ad",
  "sulted  in a \"talukdar-peasant  complementarity\"  of inrerests.P'  The ",
  "same  situation  existed  in the  North-Western  Provinces  too,  where ",
  "Mahalwari  Settlement  had  been  made  with  the  village  mulguzars. ",
  "These village  proprietors  who were the supposed  beneficiaries  of the ",
  "new land  revenue  system,  were  not  satisfied  either,  because  of high ",
  "land  revenue  demand.  It was  the owner-cultivators,  rather  than  the ",
  "rent-receiving  landlords,  who  felt  the  burden  of  over-assessment ",
  "more severely  than others  and increased  public  sales of landed  rights ",
  "were the index  of this extraordinary  pressure,  which  became  a major ",
  "cause  of  the  revolt.  Where  agriculture  was  insecure,  high  revenue ",
  "demands  inevitably  drove  the pea  ants into debt and eventually,  dis\u00ad",
  "possession,  the new civil  courts  and the legal  system contributing  to ",
  "this  process.I\"'  In  185 3  in  the  North-Western  Provinces  alone, ",
  "110,000  acres  of land  were  sold  in auction  and  therefore,  when  the ",
  "revolt  started,  the  baniya  and  the  mahajan  and  their  properties ",
  "became  the  natural  targets  of attack by  the  rioting  peasants.  \"Thus ",
  "the sale  of  land\",  as S.B.  Chaudhuri  summarises  the situation,  \"not ",

  "also  destroyed  the gentry of the country, and  both the orders being ",
  "the victims  of the operations of British civil law were united  in the ",
  "revolutionary  epoch  of  1857-58  in  a  common  effort  to  recover ",
  "what they had lost\". '06 ",
  "The story  was not  perhaps  that  straightforward,  as Eric Stokes ",
  "(1980)  has drawn our attention  to the complexities of the situation. ",
  "It should  be remembered,  first of all  that not all taluqdars  suffered ",
  "under  the  British  revenue  system.  In  many areas  the  proprietary ",
  "rights circulated  among the traditional  landed  castes and often new ",
  "landed  magnates emerged  from  the declining  castes\u00b7  in some cases ",
  "official  positions  gave advantage  to local  men in public  land sales. ",
  "These successful  taluqdars, whom Stokes has called  \"the new mag\u00ad",
  "nates\",  could adjust well to the current situation  both in Awadh and ",
  "in  the North-Western  Provinces,  and not only did they not revolt, ",
  "but they exerted  a sobering  influence on their respective  communi\u00ad",
  "ties. Not all peasants suffered equally  either. Those in the fertile and ",
  "irrigated  areas  could  more easily  withstand  the  burden  of  over\u00ad",
  "assessment  than  those in the backward  regions.  In the  latter areas ",
  "again,  it was more a  ense of relative rather  than absolute depriva\u00ad",
  "tion, which was the main cause of resentment.  While some groups of ",
  "peasanrs  reeled  under  pressure,  they could  not  take it easily that ",
  "their caste brethren were prospering in the neighbouring canal tracts ",
  "with  profitable  cash crop agriculture. ",
  "It was again in the backward regions that the peasants were seem\u00ad",
  "ingly  more  vulnerable  to  the  pressures  of  the  moneylenders  or ",
  "mahajans and were more likely to lose possession of their land. Yet, ",
  "it  is  doubtful  whether  there  was  any  direct  correlation  between ",
  "indebtedness and revolt; in fact, Stokes has argued  about an inverse ",
  "relationship  between  the two. Dry lands  with  high revenue  assess\u00ad",
  "ments were hardly attractive to the outside banias or mahajans.  They ",
  "took  possession  of  land  only where  there  was expansion  of cash ",
  "cropping.  In such cases very little actual physical dispos ession took ",
  "place,  as the motive was more political,  i.e.,  to take control  of the ",
  "peasant  producers,  rather than the land  itself  Therefore,  the back\u00ad",
  "ward  and  \"thirsty\"  tracts  with  high  revenue  demands,  where  the ",
  "intrusion  of the mahajans was the lightest,  became most prone to ",
  "outbreak of violence during  the revolt.  Also where caste brother\u00ad",
  "hoods or bhaicbaras were  powerful,  the pressure  of the  mahajans ",
  "was  better  resisted.  And  here  social  homogeneity  and  collective ",
  "power  became  crucial  factors  in promoting  rebelliousness  among ",
  "the peasantry. Community ties among  the Gujars or jars, Rajpurs or ",
  "Sayyids,  became  major  factors  in  determining  the effectiveness of https://telegram.me/UPSCMaterials https://telegram.me/FreeUPSCMaterials https://telegram.me/MaterialforExam",

  "REFORM  AND  REBELUON ",
  "the peasant rebellion.  Perhaps, the only common trait that pervaded ",
  "all the layers of rural society was a suspicion of British rule, allegedly ",
  "threatening their  religion.  The social  reforms of the earlier period ",
  "indirectly created  this environment  and the Christian  missionaries ",
  "directly contributed  to it The Hindus and the Muslims were equally ",
  "affected  and  therefore,  Hindu-Muslim unity  was all  along  main\u00ad",
  "tained  during  the revolt  No single causal explanation  can be pro\u00ad",
  "vided  for this  widespread  outbreak of violent  protest  among  the ",
  "agrarian  population  of north  India. What  Eric  Stokes  has  estab\u00ad",
  "lished,  writes C.A. Bayly, is that  \"The Indian Rebellion of 1857  was ",
  "not one movement,  ...  it was many\" .101 ",
  "Another contentious  issue  about  the revolt of 1857  is its nature ",
  "and the debate over it started almost instantaneously  as it happened. ",
  "Some contemporaries thought it was a Muslim conspiracy to restore ",
  "the Mughal  empire;  but  there  was not  much evidence  to support ",
  "that.  The  more  dominant  contemporary  official  interpretation  of ",
  "the events was that it was primarily  a mutiny of the sepoys, the civil\u00ad",
  "ian unrest being a secondary  phenomenon,  which happened  as the ",
  "unruly elements  took advantage of the breakdown of law and order. ",
  "Some of the later Indian historians coo, like S.N. Sen, in his officially ",
  "sponsored  centennial  history  of the revolt, have  echoed  the same ",
  "colonial  argument.  \"The movement  began as a military mutiny\", ",
  "Sen argued; and then \"[w]hen the administration collapsed the law\u00ad",
  "less  elements  . . .  cook  the  upper  hand\".1os  R.C.  Majumdar's ",
  "thoughts are also  identical:  \"What began as a mutiny\",  he  thinks, ",
  "\"ended  in certain areas in an outbreak of civil population\",  which ",
  "was sometimes  organised  by self-seeking  local  leaders and  some\u00ad",
  "times  was only  \"mob  violence\"  caused  by the breakdown  of the ",
  "administrative  machinery. 109  Bue differing  views  from  across  the ",
  "political spectrum were also being voiced since the time of the revolt ",
  "itself.  \"Is  it a military mutiny, or is  it a  national  revolt?\" -asked ",
  "Benjamin Disraeli in the Hou e of Commons on 27 July 1857. Karl ",
  "Marx in the summer of 1857  expressed the same doubts in the pages ",
  "of New York Daily Tribune: \"what he uohn Bull] considers  a military ",
  "mutiny\",  he  wrote,  \"is  in  truth  a  national  revolt\".  It  was  V.D. ",
  "Savarkar who drafted the revolt of 1857 directly into the historiog\u00ad",
  "raphy of Indian nationalism by describing it, in a 1909 publication, ",
  "as the \"Indian War of Independence\",  a war fought for \"su/adharma ",
  "and swaraj 11.110  Although this claim was vigorously denied  by both ",
  "Sen and Majumdar,  it received  serious  academic  support in 1959 ",
  "from  S.B.  Chaudhuri,  who  saw  in  the  revolt  \"the  first  combined ",
  "attempt of many classes of people to challenge a foreign power. This https://telegram.me/UPSCMaterials https://telegram.me/FreeUPSCMaterials https://telegram.me/MaterialforExam",
  "176 ",
  "FROM  PLASSEY TO PARTITION ",
  "is a real,  if remote,  approach\",  he thought,  \"to the  freedom  move\u00ad",
  "ment of India of a later age. 111 ",
  "The debate has been going on since then,  with a growing consen\u00ad",
  "sus gradually emerging that the revolt of 1857 was not a nationalist ",
  "movement  in  the  modem  sense  of  the  term.  In  1965  Thomas ",
  "Metcalf wrote:  \"There  is a widespread  agreement  that  it was some\u00ad",
  "thing more than  a sepoy mutiny, but something  less than  a national ",
  "revolt\". 112 It was not \"national\"  because the popular  character  of the ",
  "revolt  was  limited  to  Upper .India  alone,  while  the  regions  and ",
  "groups  that experienced  the benefits ofBritish rule remained  loyal. ",
  "There  were  also  important  groups  of collaborators.  The  Bengali ",
  "middle  classes  remained  loyal  as  they  had,  writes  Judith  Brown, ",
  "\"material  interests  in the new order,  and often  a deep,  ideological ",
  "commitment  to new ideas\"  The Punjabi princes hated the Hindu\u00ad",
  ".113 ",
  "stani soldiers and shuddered  at the thought  of a resurrection  of the ",
  "Mughal empire.  On the other hand, those who rebelled, argued C.A. ",
  "Bayly,had various motives, which were not always connected  to any ",
  "specific grievance against the British; often they fought  against each ",
  "other and this \"Indian  disunity played  into British hands.\"1 14 There ",
  "was  no premeditated  plan  or  a  conspiracy,  as  the  circulation  of ",
  "chapatis  or wheat  bread  from  village to village prior to the  revolt ",
  "conveyed confusing  messages. The rebellion was thus all negative,  it ",
  "is argued,  as the rebels did not have any plan to bring in any alterna\u00ad",
  "tive system to replace the British Raj. \"(l]n their vision of the future ",
  "the rebel leaders were hopelessly  at odds\",  writes Metcalf;  some of ",
  "them owed allegiance to the Mughal emperor  Bahadur  Shah, others ",
  "to  various  regional  princes.  \"United  in  defeat,  the  rebel  leaders ",
  "would  have fallen at each other's throats  in victory\". llS ",
  "This so-called  \"agreement\"  described  above has, however,  been ",
  "seriously questioned  by a number of historians in recent years, It can ",
  "hardly  be denied  that among  the  rebels of 1857  there  was no con\u00ad",
  "cept  of an Indian  nation  in the  modem  sense of the  term.  Peasant ",
  "actions were local affairs bound  by strictly defined territorial  bound\u00ad",
  "aries. Yet, unlike the earlier peasant  revolts, there  was now certainly ",
  "greater  interconnection  between  the territories  and  the rebels were ",
  "open  to influence from outside their  ilaqa (area). There  was coordi\u00ad",
  "nation  and communication  between  the rebels from different  parts ",
  "of north  and  central  India  and  there  were  rumours  afloat  which ",
  "bound  the  rebels in an unseen  bondage.  A common  feature  shared ",
  "by all of them  was a distaste  for the British state and disruptions  it ",
  "brought  to their  lives. Anything  that stood  for the authority  of the ",
  "Company,  therefore,  became their target of attack.  They all felt that https://telegram.me/UPSCMaterials https://telegram.me/FreeUPSCMaterials https://telegram.me/MaterialforExam",

  "their caste and religion was under threat Like the sepoys ofJ hansi, ",
  "rebels  everywhere  fought  for their  \"deen  [faith]  and dharam  [reli\u00ad",

  "ception and day-to-day experience of the authority of the alien state ",
  "in his immediate surroundings that determined the rebel's acrion'v!'? ",
  "Yet, although  unknown to each other and also perhaps separated  by ",
  "their different experiences, they were nonetheless pitted against the ",
  "same  enemy  at  the  same  historical  conjuncture.  \"They  took  up ",
  "arms\", writes Ranajit Guha, \"to recover what they believed to have ",
  "lls ",
  "been their ancestral domains\". ",
  "But what did this domain actually mean?  The idea of domain,  in ",
  "terms of geographical or social space, was perhaps now larger than ",
  "the village or their immediate  caste or kin group. As Rajat Ray has ",
  "argued, they were trying to free \"Hindustan\"  of foreign yoke. There ",
  "was remarkable  religious amity  during the revolt,  as all agreed that ",
  "Hindustan  belonged  to  Hindus  and Muslims  alike.119  The  rebels of ",
  "1857  wanted  to go back to the old familiar order and by this  they ",
  "did not mean the centralised  Mughal  state of the seventeenth  cen\u00ad",
  "tury. They  wanted  to  restore  the decentralised  political  order of ",
  "eighteenth century India,  when  the provincial rulers functioned with ",
  "considerable  autonomy,  but all acknowledged  the Mughal emperor ",
  "as the source of political legitimacy. When Birjis Qadr was crowned ",
  "by the rebel sepoys as the King of Awadh, the condition imposed on ",
  "him was to recognise the Mughal  emperor  as the suzerain author\u00ad",
  "ity.120 Delhi, the Mughal capital and Bahadur Shah, the Mughal em\u00ad",

  "no dispute  among the  rebels.  In his most  recent book,  C.A. Bayly ",
  "has discovered in the  rebellion  of 1857  \"a set of patriotic  revolts\". ",
  "What  the rebels demanded,  he writes,  \"was the restoration  of the ",
  "Indo-Mughal  parrias  within  the  broader  constellation of Mughal ",
  "legitimacy,  animated  by  mutual  respect  and  a  healthy  balance ",
  "between lands  and  peoples\" .121  As the  revolt made  progress, even ",
  "among  the  so-called  collaborators  there  was  no  uncritical accep\u00ad",
  "tance of British rule. The profession  of loyalty, for example, by the ",
  "Calcutta intelligentsia  was not without  dilemma,  as they too were ",
  "feeling what the Hindoo  Patriot described, the \"grievances insepara\u00ad",
  "ble from subjection to a foreign rule\".  The paper aptly summed up ",
  "the dilemma:  \"This loyalty, it may be true, springs nearer  from  the ",
  "head than  from the heart\" .122  Thus, conscious voices of dissent and ",
  "disaffection  against foreign rule, if not always an avowed yearning ",
  "for liberation, ran across the different sections of population in India https://telegram.me/UPSCMaterials https://telegram.me/FreeUPSCMaterials https://telegram.me/MaterialforExam",
  "178  FROM  PLASSEYTO  PARTITION ",
  "in 1857-58.  In recent  years, the pendulum  of historical  interpreta\u00ad",
  "tion of 1857 has moved considerably  to the opposite  direction. ",
  "The other  important  question  about  the character  of the revolt is ",
  "whether  or  not  it  was an  elitist  movement.  Some  historians  like ",
  "Judith  Brown  think  that during  the revolt the feudal elements  were ",
  "the decision makers and thatmuch of the revolt was determined and ",
  "shaped  by the presence  or absence  of a thriving  magnate element ",
  "committed  to British  rule, for it was only they who could give the ",
  "revolt a general  direcrion. ! \"  Eric Stokes goes on to conclude that ",
  "\"Rural  revolt in  1857  was  essentially  elitist  in  character\" .124  This ",
  "position,  however, trivialises  the role of the masses. So far as the feu\u00ad",
  "dal  lords  were  concerned,  in  many  cases they  were  reluctant  to ",
  "assume leadership  and were  indeed pushed  by the rebels.  Bahadur ",
  "Shah was taken by surprise  when  approached  by the rebel  sepoys, ",
  "and only with great hesitation  did he agree to be their leader. Nana ",
  "Sahib  in Kanpur-as it was later  revealed  in the confession  of his ",
  "close confidante  Tantia  Topi-was  seized  by  the rebel  sepoys and ",
  "was  threatened  with  dire  consequences;  he  did  not  have  much ",
  "choice other  than joining hands with  the rebels.t-'  And the Rani  of ",
  "Jhansi  was actually  threatened  with  death  if she did  not  assist  the ",
  "sepoys  or  collaborated  with  the  British.126  The  initiative  for  the ",
  "revolt and even its effectiveness  did  not really depend  on the feudal ",
  "leadership. ",
  "So  far  as the  taluqdars  were  concerned,  it is  true  that  in many ",
  "areas peasants followed their  leaders, because of the existence of a ",
  "pre-capitalist  symbiotic  relationship  between  the  two  classes.  But ",
  "the  role  of the  taluqdars  varied  widely  from region  to  region.  In ",
  "Awadh, for example, as Rudrangshu  Mukherjee has shown,  taluqdar ",
  "participation  was  never  universal:  some  of them  remained  loyal, ",
  "some became turncoats, others followed  a middle course and some ",
  "submitted  at the sight of the approaching  British  rroops.121  In many ",
  "areas the peasants and  the artisans forced the taluqdars to join  the ",
  "revolt,  while in some cases,  the masses insisted  on carrying  on the ",
  "revolt even after the taluqdars  had made peace with the British. And ",
  "above all,  the main initiative came from the sepoys, the peasants in ",
  "uniform,  who now had shed their  uniforms  to merge with the peas\u00ad",
  "ants again. Almost everywhere in central and northern  India, the ris\u00ad",
  "ing  in the army barracks  soon  spread  to the neighbouring  villages; ",
  "caste and ethnic ties of the sepoys also connected them  to the peas\u00ad",
  "ant communities.  Almost  everywhere,  rebel action was preceded  by ",
  "conferencing  and  panchayat  meetings or open gatherings  of large ",
  "number of rebels.  And finally  the chapatis,  which  circulated  rapidly https://telegram.me/UPSCMaterials https://telegram.me/FreeUPSCMaterials https://telegram.me/MaterialforExam",
  "179 ",
  "REFORM AND REBEWON ",
  "between  villages  in  geometrical  progression  conveying  divergent ",
  "meanings to different peoples, stood as a symbol or an omen, rather ",
  "than index or cause, of an impending crisis. m  It is difficult to ignore ",
  "the  evidence  of autonomous  mobilisation  of the  peasantry  in the ",
  "rebellions of 1857-58. ",
  "The  rebellion  was suppressed  with  brutal  force.  Lord  Canning ",
  "gathered British troops  at Calcutta and sent them to free Delhi. On ",
  "20September1  857, Delhi was finally recaptured  and Bahadur Shah ",
  "Zafar was imprisoned and later deported; but this did not yet mean ",
  "the end of the rebellion. Very slowly Banaras, Allahabad and Kanpur ",
  "were  taken  over, the  rebels fighting for every inch of territory and ",
  "the British unleashing an unmitigated  reign of terror in the country\u00ad",
  "side. The arrival of fresh British troops  at Calcutta in October  deci\u00ad",
  "sively tilted  the balance against  the  rebels.  Between  the  spring  of ",
  "1858 and the beginning of 1859, British troops gradually recovered ",
  "Gwalior, Doab,  Lucknow  and  the  rest of Awadh, Rohilkhand  and ",
  "the remainder of central India. The contemporary  colonial explana\u00ad",
  "tions for the defeat of the sepoys and of the rural rebels highlighted ",
  "British bravery, their superior  national  character,  better leadership ",
  "qualities and effective military strategies, as against the lack of unity, ",
  "discipline  and  order among  the  rebels. Some of the  earlier  Indian ",
  "historians too believed in the same theory. Modem  historians would, ",
  "however, point out that the British won as they committed unlimited ",
  "men and resources to reclaim their empire, while the sepoys suffered ",
  "from a desperate  scarcity of cash. The  ordinary  rural  rebels in the ",
  "true  fashion of a peasant  army were only equipped  with  primitive ",
  "weapons  and  most  of them  were  not even  trained  soldiers. They ",
  "were facing the British army, which not only had control  over most ",
  "sophisticated  weapons,  but who were the masters of practically the ",
  "whole of India, had the backing of a centralised bureaucracy and had ",
  "access to an efficient communication  system. Furthermore,  as Stokes ",
  "has  argued,  the  rebel  sepoys  showed  a  remarkable  \"centripetal ",
  "impulse to congregate at Delhi\", which prevented  the rebellion from ",
  "spreading  as much as it could. So when  by March  1858  Delhi and ",
  "Lucknow  fell,  the  rebellion  entered  its  dying  phase.P?  The  ex\u00ad",
  "tremely localised nature of the uprisings helped the British to tackle ",
  "them one at a time. By the beginning of 1859 all was over. ",
  "The  revolt of 1857  is in many ways an important watershed  in ",
  "Indian history. First of all, it ended the rule of the East India Com\u00ad",
  "pany. Even before peace was fully restored  in India, the British par\u00ad",
  "liament passed on 2 August 1858 an Act for the Better Government ",
  "of India, declaring  Queen  Victoria as the sovereign of British India https://telegram.me/UPSCMaterials https://telegram.me/FreeUPSCMaterials https://telegram.me/MaterialforExam",
  "180 ",
  "FROM  PLASSEY TO PARTITION ",
  "and providing  for the appointment of a Secretary  of State for India ",
  "who would be a member  of the cabinet  The act was to come into ",
  "effect on I November and on that day the Queen issued a Proclama\u00ad",
  "tion,  which  promised  religious  toleration  and  proposed  to govern ",
  "Indians  according to their established  traditions and customs.P\"  Ber\u00ad",
  "nard  Cohn has summarised  what  this constitutional  change  meant ",
  "for the status of British  rule in India: \"In conceptual  terms, the Brit\u00ad",
  "ish,  who  had started  their  rule as 'outsiders',  became  'insiders'  by ",
  "vesting in their monarch  the sovereignty of India.'1 31  The proclama\u00ad",
  "tion provided  for the ordering  of the relationship  between the mon\u00ad",
  "arch and her  representatives  in India, their  Indian subjects and the ",
  "princes,  all  of them  being  neatly  fitted  into  an elaborate  imperial ",
  "hierarchy.  Apart  from  this, there were  other  far-reaching  changes ",
  "resulring from almost one year of bloody racial warfare. The sepoys ",
  "were charged with a serious breach of trust and this in general made ",
  "all the Indians  suspect  in the eyes of the British,  both  in India and at ",
  "home. The stories of sepoy atrociries raised the clamour for punish\u00ad",
  "ment  and  retribution  and  if  the  saner  elements  like Viceroy Lord ",
  "Canning  tried  to restrain  this hysteria,  he soon  earned  the derisive ",
  "epithet  of \"Clemency  Canning\"  from  his  own  countrymen  and ",
  "requests  were sent to the Queen  for his recall.  Although  this  mad\u00ad",
  "ness  subsided  gradually,  it  left  a lasting  imprint  on  British-Indian ",
  "relations  in the subsequent  period.  Racial segregarion  from now on ",
  "became firmly entrenched,  as Indians were regarded  not only differ\u00ad",
  "ent,  but  also racially  inferior.  What  is  more  important,  the  earlier ",
  "reformist  zeal of a self-confident  Victorian liberalism  now evidently ",
  "took a back seat,  as many believed  now that  Indians  were beyond ",
  "reform. This new mood, which Thomas Metcalf has called the \"con\u00ad",
  "servative brand of liberalism\",  rested upon the \"solid support of the ",
  "conservative  and aristocratic  classes and upon the principle of com\u00ad",
  "plete  non-interference  in  the  traditional  structure  of Indian  soci\u00ad",
  "ety\".132 This conservative reaction  evidently  made the empire more ",
  "autocratic  and  denied  the aspirations of the  educated  Indians  for ",
  "sharing power. This, therefore, also made the empire more vulnera\u00ad",
  "ble,  as from  this frustration  of the  educated  middle  classes  arose ",
  "modem nationalism  towards the end of the nineteenth  century. ",
