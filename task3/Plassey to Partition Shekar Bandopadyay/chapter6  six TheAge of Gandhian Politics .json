  "THE  CARROTS  OF  LIMITED  SELF-GOVERNMENT, ",
  "The second  half of the nineteenth  century,  particularly  the period ",
  "after the suppression  of the revolt of  1857,  is considered  to be the ",
  "high noon of British imperialism in India. A self-confident  paternal\u00ad",
  "ism  tended  to tum  into  a despotism,  which  was not  prepared  to ",
  "accept any self-governing right  for the Indians.  This imperial  idea ",
  "had a philosophical as well as functional  basis.  Philosophically, there ",
  "was what Eric Stokes has called  a \"Liberal  division  on India\" .1  The ",
  "division  arose on the question  of democracy  and self-government  to ",
  "the dependent  empire. While on the Irish  Home  Rule question the ",
  "educated mind in England had gone against the earlier  Gladstonian ",
  "liberalism,  utilitarianism  in the late  nineteenth  century  developed ",
  "certain  divergent  strands.  There  was on the one hand,  an extreme ",
  "liberal  position  taken  by John  Bright and  the  Manchester  School, ",
  "which became outrightly critical of British rule in India. Taking the ",
  "middle  course were  the  other  liberal  utilitarians  like  John  Stuart ",
  "Mill, who believed  that democracy and self-government were essen\u00ad",
  "tial checks on despotic power, but the doctrine was only suitable for ",
  "civilised  people.  India,  therefore,  had to be governed  despotically. ",
  "But  they  also  inherited  the  optimism  of  the  eighteenth  century ",
  "Enlightenment that human nature could be changed through  proper ",
  "education. So they conceived the imperial  goal as an educative mis\u00ad",
  "sion:  Indians could  be entrusted  with  self-government  when  they ",
  "were  properly educated  for the purpose of self-rule  in accordance ",
  "with the principles of rationalism  and natural justice. J. S. Mill had ",
  "his  disciples  in  India  like  Macaulay  and  Lord  Ripon,  who  still ",
  "believed  that the Indians could  be given  self-governing  rights at an ",
  "appropriate date, when  they would be properly educated for this. ",
  "There was, however, a third and more authoritarian  strand.  Both ",
  "Bentham  and  James Mill  thought  that  democracy  was a checking ",
  "device against the abuse of power and ultimately a means of register\u00ad",
  "ing the will of the majority.  But neither had any belief in individual https://telegram.me/UPSCMaterials https://telegram.me/FreeUPSCMaterials https://telegram.me/MaterialforExam",
  "280 ",
  "FROM PWSEY TO PARTmON ",
  "liberty  for its own  sake;  happiness  and  not  liberty  was  the  end  of ",
  "good government.  From this, an extreme  authoritarian  position  was ",
  "derived  by Fitzjames Stephen,  who  succeeded  the liberal Macaulay ",
  "as the law member  in the  viceroy's council  in India.  He combined ",
  "Benthamism  with Hobbesian despotism:  law and good government, ",
  "he thought,  were  the instruments  of improvement,  and  both  were ",
  "meaningless unless backed by power. From this philosophy  followed ",
  "his  position  on  Britain's  role  in India  being  the  great  mission  of ",
  "establishing  peace and  order  conducive  to the progress  of civilisa\u00ad",
  "tion, pax Britannica.  The task of the British was to introduce  essen\u00ad",
  "tial principles  of European  civilisation.  He rejected  the  notion  that ",
  "the British had a moral duty to introduce  representative  institutions ",
  "in India.  It could  be conceded  if only there  was a strong  demand ",
  "from among a sizeable section of the Indians.  Stephen,  with  his im\u00ad",
  "mense influence on the Indian civil servants, became the philosopher ",
  "of authoritarian  British imperialism  in India in the  late nineteenth ",
  "century.  It became  the  tradition  of direct  rule,  of imperial  law, of ",
  "empire  resting on power and an Evangelical sense of duty to initiate ",
  "improvement  and  rejecting  the  notion  of  buying  support  with ",
  "favour to any particular  class.2 ",
  "Yet the Government  of India had to introduce,  though  gradually, ",
  "the  principle  of  representative  self-government  in  the  late  nine\u00ad",
  "teenth  and the early twentieth  centuries.  The Indian Councils Act. of ",
  "1861  established  limited  self-government  in  Bengal,  Madras  and ",
  "Bombay  and  it  was  extended  to  the North-Western  Provinces  in ",
  "1886 and Punjab in 1897. The Act of 1892 increased the number  of ",
  "nominated  members  in  provincial  legislative councils.  Then  there ",
  "were the Local Self-Government  Act of 1882, the llbert Bill of 1883, ",
  "the Morley-Minto  Reforms of 1909 \u00b7and the Montagu-Chelmsford ",
  "Reforms of 1919.  How do we then  explain  these reforms?  The old ",
  "'Cambridge  School' would refer to its theory  of \"weak imperialism\" ",
  "and argue that  the reforms were because of the functional  needs of ",
  "imperialism.  The  empire  being essentially \"weak\",  politically  there ",
  "was a need  for  Indian  collaborators.  Therefore,  there  was a grad\u00ad",
  "ual lndianisation  of the  civil service and entry  of Indians  at lower ",
  "levels of local self-governing institutions.  In the British empire,  there ",
  "was  strong  centralised  control,  but  slackness  at  the  bottom;  the ",
  "devolution  of power was essentially to rope in more collaborators. 3 ",
  "B.R. Tomlinson  (1975), on the other hand, has argued about a fiscal ",
  "crisis of the British Indian empire which left its imperial  obligations ",
  "unfulfilled.  So devolution  of power  was to buy Indian  support,  as ",

  "THE AGE OF GANDHIAN ",
  "revenue and would be more judicious in spending  it This was not a ",
  "very new idea in itself, as discussion about  devolution  on financial ",
  "reasons had started  as early as the late nineteenth  century.  Indeed, ",
  "opposition  to  the  idea  of  Indian  self-government  melted  down ",
  "because of war pressures and financial weaknesses; but it is difficult ",
  "to  explain  the  reforms  solely in terms of fiscal exigencies. A more ",
  "important  reason  behind  this gradual  devolution  was the  growing ",
  "strength of Indian nationalism which the Cambridge cluster of histo\u00ad",
  "rians chose to underestimate. ",
  "Intensity of the Swadeshi movement  and the spread of extremism ",
  "had forced upon the administration some new thoughts  on constitu\u00ad",
  "tional  reforms,  while  revolutionary  terrorism  reinforced  this  pro\u00ad",
  "cess. Fresh thinking  had started  since  1906,  as Secretary  of  State ",
  "Lord Morley, a liberal scholar, urged Viceroy Lord Minto to balance ",
  "the  unpopular  Bengal partition  with  reforms.  Although  partition ",
  "was declared  to  be a settled  fact,  there  was also a realisation  that ",
  "India could no longer be ruled with a \"cast iron bureaucracy\".  Indi\u00ad",
  "ans should  be given some share of power;  they had to be admitted ",
  "into the legislature, and if necessary, even into the executive council. ",
  "In  the  legislarures,  more  time  for  budget  discussion  was  to  be ",
  "allowed  and  amendments  to  government  sponsored  resolutions ",
  "were to be admitted;  but at the same time, official majority was to be ",
  "retained. There  were three aspects of this new policy:  outright  re\u00ad",
  "pression on the one hand, concessions to rally the moderates  on the ",
  "other,  matched  by divide and rule through  separate  electorates  for ",
  "the Muslims. The discussions on the constitutional  reforms were ini\u00ad",
  "tiated  in Morley's  budget  speech  in September  1906.  There  were ",
  "some controversies  between London  and Calcutta,  particularly  cen\u00ad",
  "tring  round  the  definition  of  moderates.  By  this  term,  Morley ",
  "thought  of the  Congress  moderates,  while Minto  meant  the  loyal ",
  "elements  outside  the Congress,  like the rulers of the princely states ",
  "or the Muslim aristocracy. The post-mutiny  policy of alliance with ",
  "the conservative  elements  in Indian  society was now to be further ",
  "institutionalised  in the face of mounting  nationalist  pressure. ",
  "The  Indian Councils Act of 1909  (Morley-Minto  Reforms) pro\u00ad",
  "vided for limited self-government and therefore satisfied none of the ",
  "Indian  political  groups.  It was the  most short-lived  of all constitu\u00ad",
  "tional reforms in British India and had to be revised within ten years. ",
  "It did allow somewhat  greater  power  for budget  discussion,  raising ",
  "questions  and  sponsoring  resolutions  to  members  of  legislative ",
  "councils,  who  were  to be elected  for the first time.  The  act intro\u00ad",
  "duced  the  principle  of  election,  but  under  various  constraints. https://telegram.me/UPSCMaterials https://telegram.me/FreeUPSCMaterials https://telegram.me/MaterialforExam",
  "282 ",
  "FROM  PLASSEY TO PARTITION ",
  "Details of seat allocation and electoral qualifications  were left to be ",
  "decided by  the local  governments,  and  this left enough  space  for ",
  "bureaucratic  manipulation.  Special  provision  was  made  for  addi\u00ad",
  "tional  representation  of  professional  classes,  the  landholders,  the ",
  "Muslims,  as well as European and Indian commerce.  Official major\u00ad",
  "ity was retained  in  the  Imperial Legislative  Council, which  would ",
  "have only 27 elected members out of 60; and out of those 27 seats, 8 ",
  "were  reserved  for  the  Muslim  separate  electorate.  Non-official ",
  "majorities  were provided for in the Provincial  Councils,  but impor\u00ad",
  "tance of this non-official majority was reduced by the fact that many ",
  "of these non-officials were to benom inated by the government. The ",
  "Bengal provincial legislature was given an elected majority, but four ",
  "of the  elected  members were  to  represent  European  commercial ",
  "interests,  who were always expected  to vote with  the government. ",
  "Finally,  the electorate  was based on high property  qualifications and ",
  "therefore  was  heavily  restricted.  There  were  disparities  too,  as ",
  "income qualifications  for the Muslims were lower than those for the ",
  "Hindus. And above everything, the Government of India was given ",
  "the general  power  to  disallow  any candidate  from  contesting  the ",
  "election  on suspicion of being politically dangerous. ",
  "Dissatisfaction  with  the  existing  constitution  and  clamour  for ",
  "more self-governing rights increased during World War One. There ",
  "was also  now greater  acceptance of the  idea of Indian  self-rule in ",
  "British  political  circles,  and  this  brought  in  important  changes  in ",
  "British  policies too.  But the  idea of reform  perhaps  originated  in ",
  "India,  where  the government  had been facing the radical  transfor\u00ad",
  "mation  of  Indian  politics  on  a  day-to-day  basis.  This  experience ",
  "strengthened  the new Viceroy Lord Chelmsford's  liberal vision  of ",
  "enunciating  the  goal  of  \"Indian  self-government  within  the  E\ufffd ",
  "pire\".\"  But as the Government  of India's dispatch  to the secretary of ",
  "state in November 1916  argued, this should be offered gradually, in ",
  "keeping with  the rate of diffusion  of education,  resolution of reli\u00ad",
  "gious differences  and  acquisition  of political experience.  In  other ",
  "words, there was no definite timetable for devolution, but  enough ",
  "safeguards to protect Indians against the tyranny of their own rule. ",
  "However, the ultimate goal of transplanting  British parliamentary ",
  "institutions  in India had to be declared  as the moderates  in Indian ",
  "politics were gradually being sidelined  by the radicals. In December ",
  "1916 the Congress and the Muslim League for the first.rime drew up ",
  "a common constitutional  programme at Lucknow. The beginning of ",
  "the  Home  Rule  agitation  and  the  internment  of its leader  Annie ",
  "Besant in April 1917  further  radicalised  Indian  politics, as we shall ",

  "283 ",
  "THE AGE OF GANDHIAN  POLITICS ",
  "see. Lord Chelmsford's  administration  had already allowed  a num\u00ad",
  "ber of concessions to nationalist demands,  such as customs  duty on ",
  "cotton imports without  a countervailing  excise duty, ban on labour ",
  "emigration  etc. Now  it was desperate for a declaration  of goals for ",
  "British rule  in India,  but  nothing  happened  until  Edwin Montagu ",
  "took  over as the Secretary of State for India in July 1917. He has ",
  "been described by a sympathetic historian  as \"the most liberal Secre\u00ad",
  "tary of State since Ripon\" .5 Montagu on 20 August 1917  made a his\u00ad",
  "toric declaration  at the House of Commons that henceforth  British ",
  "policy in India would have an overall objective of\"gradual develop\u00ad",
  "ment of self-governing  institutions,  with a view to the progressive ",
  "realization  of responsible government in India as an integral part of ",
  "British  empire\" .6 The declaration, in other words, did not propose ",
  "the end of empire or independence for India. But the reform propos\u00ad",
  "als were definitely  an improvement  over the  1909 act, as its main ",
  "theme was elected majority in the provinces with executive responsi\u00ad",
  "bility. But the  responsible  government was to be realised  progres\u00ad",
  "sively, thus suggesting an indefinite  timetable that  could  be easily ",
  "manipulated  to frustrate liberal  expectations. ",
  "Before we jump to any conclusion on whether or not the Montagu\u00ad",
  "Chelmsford  reforms really sought  to  introduce representative  and ",
  "responsible government  in India, we should first examine its provi\u00ad",
  "sions.  The  Government  of  India  Act of  1919  provided  for  a  bi\u00ad",
  "cameral legislature  at the centre, the council of state and the legisla\u00ad",
  "tive assembly. The latter would have an elected majority, but no con\u00ad",
  "trol over the ministers. The viceroy would have a veto in the form of ",
  "the 'certificate'  procedure for pushing the rejected bills. The elector\u00ad",
  "ates  were  considerably  enlarged  to 5 .5 million  for the  provinces ",
  "and 1.5  million for the imperial legislature. But on the other hand, ",
  "despite some theoretical criticism of the principle  of separate  elec\u00ad",
  "torate in  the Montagu-Chelmsford  Report, communal representa\u00ad",
  "tion and reservations were not only retained,  but also considerably ",
  "extended.  In addition  to the Muslims, Sikhs  were granted separate ",
  "electorate  too,  while seats were reserved for the non-Brahmans in ",
  "Madras and the 'depressed classes' were offered nominated  seats in ",
  "the legislatures at all levels. However, the most innovative feature of ",
  "the new act was 'dyarchy',  which meant that certain functions of the ",
  "provincial  governments  were  to  be  tranJfe  rred  to  the  ministers ",
  "responsible to the legislative assemblies, while  other subjects were to ",
  "be kept as 'reserved'  for firm bureaucratic control. The departments ",
  "were actually transferred were, however, ofless political weight, ",
  "that ",
  "such  as education, health, agriculture,  local  bodies etc. These had https://telegram.me/UPSCMaterials https://telegram.me/FreeUPSCMaterials https://telegram.me/MaterialforExam",
  "284  FROM PLASSEYTO PARTITION ",
  "limited funds, which would invariably discredit  the Indian ministers, ",
  "while more  vital departments, such  as law and  order, finance etc. ",
  "were kept under official control. This was co some extent  balanced ",
  "off by the provision  of parity of representation  between the Europe\u00ad",
  "ans and Indians  in the provincial  executive councils.  But the provin\u00ad",
  "cial  governors  too  had  veto  and  certificate  powers.  The  revenue ",
  "resources were divided  between  the centre and  the provinces,  with ",
  "land  revenue going to the provinces, and income tax remaining  with ",
  "the centre. ",
  "The significance of the reform of 1919 has been assessed variously ",
  "by different  historians.  Philip Woods,  on the one hand,  has argued ",
  "that the ideas behind  the reforms \"were crucial  in establishing  par\u00ad",
  "liamentary  democracy  in India and,  thereby,  in beginning  the  pro\u00ad",
  "cess of decolonisation\".\"  For Carl Bridge, on the ocher hand,  these ",
  "were measures to \"safeguard the essentials of the British position\" in ",
  "India. 8 For Tomlinson,  it was an attempt to mobilise \"an influential ",
  "section of Indian opinion  ...  to support the Raj\". 9 The major prob\u00ad",
  "lem  of the reform, as Peter Robb has identified,  was its being  \"lim\u00ad",
  "ited by ideas  of continuing  British  presence\"  Many Indians  by this ",
  ".10 ",
  "time  had  moved  beyond  the  idea  of self-government  within  the ",
  "empire.  Their  new  goal  was swaraj,  which  was soon  going  to  be ",
  "defined  as complete  independence.  The reform  therefore  failed  co ",
  "satisfy Indian political  opinions, and prevent the eventual mass move\u00ad",
  "ment. The Cambridge School  has in a different way sought to estab\u00ad",
  "lish  a connection  between  the constitutional  reforms of 1909  and ",
  "1919  and the emergence  of mass politics after World War One. As ",
  "the electorate  was widened,  the Indian leaders were forced to oper\u00ad",
  "ate in a democratic  way and seek the support  of the masses.11  This ",
  "interpretation  does not necessarily explain  the mass upsurge under ",
  "Mahatma  Gandhi.  A major  theme  of  Gandhi's  non-cooperation ",
  "programme launched  in December 1920 was the boycott of the new ",
  "councils. Gandhian  philosophy,  as we will see, was based  on a cri\u00ad",
  "tique of W estem civil society;  the mass movement  he engineered  had ",
  "an altogether different  logic, as his mission was to liberate Indian poli\u00ad",
  "tics from this constricted  arena  of constiturionalism. ",

  "12 ",
  "as \"a movement representing the classes\" as opposed to the masses.13 https://telegram.me/UPSCMaterials https://telegram.me/FreeUPSCMaterials https://telegram.me/MaterialforExam",
  "285 ",
  "THE AGE OF GANDHIAN  PolmCS ",
  "What  these descriptions  essentially imply is that nationalist  politics ",
  "until this time was participated  only by a limited group of Western\u00ad",
  "educated professionals,  whose new skills had enabled them  to take ",
  "advantage  of the  opportunities  offered  by the  Raj  in the  form  of ",
  "administrative  positions,  seats  in the  district  boards  or  legislative ",
  "councils. They belonged mainly to certain specific castes and com\u00ad",
  "munities,  certain  linguistic and  economic  groups,  living primarily ",
  "in the  three  presidency  towns  of Calcutta,  Bombay and  Madras. ",
  "D.A. Low has described these classes as \"the underlings of the Brit\u00ad",
  "ish rulers\", who were marginally, if at all, interested in any far reach\u00ad",
  "ing economic or social change in India. They were more concerned ",
  "about  creating  a new elite society and  culture  for themselves and ",
  "were influenced by the ideas and ideals of the British aristocracy or ",
  "the middle classes. 14 Apart from these groups, like the bhadralok  of ",
  "Bengal, the Chitpavan Brahmans of Bombay or the Tamil Brahmans ",
  "of Madras,  the  other  sections  of the  society,  like the  lower-caste ",
  "Hindus  or the Muslims, the  landlords  and the  peasants,  both  rich ",
  "and landless, and commercial men of all kinds, showed reluctance to ",
  "join Congress politics. They lived in Bihar, Orissa, the Central  Prov\u00ad",
  "inces and  Berar  as well  as in the  United  Provinces  and  Gujarat, ",
  "which  could  be described  as the  \"backward  provinces\"  so  far as ",
  "Congress politics were concerned. The colonial government,  there\u00ad",
  "fore, could take comfort in the fact that Congress was being run as a ",
  "closed shop by \"a microscopic minority\". ",
  "This early Congress politics was also limited in goals and rather ",
  "unspectacular  in achievements. The  moderates  after the Surat Split ",
  "in 1907 demanded  colonial self-government,  as against the extrem\u00ad",
  "ist demand  of  complete  independence.  Their  organisations  were ",
  "seemingly based on personality networks woven around such prom\u00ad",
  "inent leaders as S.N. Banerjea, P.M. Mehta or G.K. Gokhale on one ",
  "side, and Bepin Pal, B.G. lilak or Lajpat Rai on the other. In popular ",
  "perception,  there appeared  to be no difference in principle  or con\u00ad",
  "viction between  the  two  groups  of leaders,  apparently  engaged in ",
  "nothing but fruitless polemics. Both the groups had lost credibility as ",
  "they had failed to achieve their stated goals. The constitutional  poli\u00ad",
  "tics of the moderates  had failed to impress the British government ",
  "and  that  was  amply  reflected  in  the  Morley-Minto  Reforms  of ",
  "1909. Extremism was confined  mainly to Bengal, Maharashtra  and ",
  "Punjab, where outbreak of terrorism allowed the government  to un\u00ad",
  "leash repression. Deportation  and long sentences broke the rank of ",
  "their  leadership  and  forced  the  movement  to  move underground ",
  "and into  further  isolation  from the  people.  With  extremist  leaders https://telegram.me/UPSCMaterials https://telegram.me/FreeUPSCMaterials https://telegram.me/MaterialforExam",
  "286 ",
  "FROM  PLASSEY TO PARTmON ",
  "like Tilak in prison,  the moderate-dominated  Congress  was immer\u00ad",
  "sed in total  inactivity. In other  words,  by  1915-17  both  these  two ",
  "varieties of politics had reached an impasse, and when Gandhi  came ",
  "to encounter  these politicians,  they had very little room to manoeu\u00ad",
  "vre.  By contrast,  Gandhi  as a newcomer  to Indian  politics  was not ",
  "tainted  by the  failures of any of these groups.  He  did  not  have a ",
  "vested  interest  in the political  status quo  and  therefore  more  pre\u00ad",
  "pared to welcome a shift of power from the Western-educated  elites ",
  "to  the  hands  of the  masses. He  had a clear  vision of the  pluralist ",
  "nature  of Indian society, but was dedicated  to the  ideal of a united ",
  "India. For the younger generation  of Indians, frustrated  by the eter\u00ad",
  "nal  squabbles  between  the  moderates  and  extremists,  he  offered ",
  "something refreshingly new. In an age of moral vacuum and physical ",
  "despondency,  he promised a political programme  that was also spiri\u00ad",
  "tually noble. ",
  "In  order  to  understand  why  Gandhi's  philosophy  and  political ",
  "programme  had a wide popular  appeal, it is necessary to have a look ",
  "at the social and economic environment  of India during World War ",
  "One,  as it undoubtedly  created  a congenial  context  for  his emer\u00ad",
  "gence  as  an  undisputed  leader  of  Indian  nationalism.  The  most ",
  "immediate  outcome  of war was a phenomenal  increase  in defence ",
  "expenditure,  which  instead  of being cut back,  kept  on  rising  even ",
  "after 1919. The result was a huge national debt, which rose by more ",
  "than  Rs.  3  million between  1914 and 1923. This meant  heavy war ",
  "loans and rising taxes and since land  revenue  had  been settled  and ",
  "could  not  be immediately  enhanced,  there  was more  indirect  taxa\u00ad",
  "tion  on  trade  and  industry.  There  were  higher  customs  duties,  an ",
  "income tax,  super tax on companies  and undivided  Hindu  business ",
  "families,  excess profit  tax and so on. Ultimately the burden  of this ",
  "new taxation  fell on the common people, as it resulted in a phenom\u00ad",
  "enal price rise. According to official calculations,  price index  on an ",
  "all-India  level rose from  147 in 1914 to 281 in 1920  (1873 as the ",
  "base year).\"  This unprecedented  price rise was partly due to indirect ",
  "taxes,  partly  due  to  transport  and  other  economic  dislocations. ",
  "There  was underproduction  of food  crops  during  the war  period, ",
  "caused by two extraordinary  crop failures in 1918-19 and 1920-21, ",
  "affecting  large areas of United Provinces, Punjab, Bombay, Central ",
  "Provinces,  Bihar and  Orissa.  And when  there  was already  serious ",
  "shortage  of food for home consumption,  export  of food to feed the ",
  "army fighting abroad continued. This resulted in near famine condi\u00ad",
  "tions in many areas, where  the miseries of the people  were  further ",
  "compounded  by the outbreak  of an influenza epidemic.  According https://telegram.me/UPSCMaterials https://telegram.me/FreeUPSCMaterials https://telegram.me/MaterialforExam",
  "THE  AGE  OP  GANDHIAN  POLITICS  287 ",
  "to the census of 1921, about  12 to 13 million people had lost their ",
  "lives due to the famine and epidemic of 1918-19, causing a stultifi\u00ad",

  "army was going on without  interruptions,  leading to a steady accu\u00ad",
  "mulation  of popular  resentment  in the  countryside. More  so,  be\u00ad",
  "cause all the sections of rural society had already been  affected  by ",
  "the economic impact of war. While prices of industrial and imported ",
  "goods and food crops were rising, affecting poor  peasantry,  that of ",
  "exported  Indian  agricultural  raw materials  did  not increase  at the ",
  "same pace.  The  outcome  was a decline  in export,  rising stockpiles ",
  "and falling acreage for commercial crops, causing a crisis in the mar\u00ad",
  "ket in 191 7-19. This adversely affected the richer peasantry. During ",
  "this period,  there  was a marked  increase in the number  of peasant\u00ad",
  "proprietors  being dispossessed and  turned  into  tenants-at-will,  and ",
  "land passing into the hands of the non-cultivating  classes. This pro\u00ad",
  "cess was intensive and more dearly visible between  1914 and  1922 ",
  "in Madras  and United  Provinces.  In some areas the  mounting  eco\u00ad",
  "nomic distress of the peasantry  found expression  in organised peas\u00ad",
  "ant protests,  such as the Kisan Sabha movement  in UP which started ",
  "in 1918. ",
  "The  other major economic  development  during  World War One ",
  "was the growth  of industries. Due to fiscal requirements,  economic ",
  "necessities and  nationalist  pressure,  there  was a change  in official ",
  "policy towards industrialisation,  leading to noticeable developments ",
  "in the jute and textile industries.  While the jute industry developed ",
  "mainly with British capital, it was Indian capital that was involved in ",
  "the textile industry in Bombay and Ahmedabad.  Here the big indus\u00ad",
  "trial magnates remained loyal to the British, as they were dependent ",
  "on exports  and on government  assistance for keeping the prices of ",
  "raw cotton  low and in dealing with  labour  unrest. By contrast,  the ",
  "small and middle traders  had a series of grievances against the war\u00ad",
  "time  taxes  and  the  fluctuating  rupee-sterling  exchange  rates.  The ",
  "other important  result of industrialisation  was an expansion  of the ",
  "working  class. According  to census  figures, the number  of workers ",
  "in the organised  industries  increased by 575 thousand  between  1911 ",
  "and  1921 and this expanding  working  class was really hard  hit by ",
  "the  extraordinary  price hike of this period.  The  wartime  and  the ",
  "post-war  periods  witnessed  super profits  for businessmen,  but de\u00ad",
  "clining real wages for the workers.  In cities like Lahore or Bombay ",
  "the average cost of living for workers had increased by 60 to 70 per ",
  "cent, while wages rose by only 15 to 25 per cent;l7 the situation  was https://telegram.me/UPSCMaterials https://telegram.me/FreeUPSCMaterials https://telegram.me/MaterialforExam",

  "described  as a \"sort  of epidemic  strike  fever\"  that  affected  all the ",
  "industrial centres in India, 18 a topic which we will discuss in the next ",
  "chapter. ",
  "World War One thus brought  in social and economic  dislocations ",
  "for  nearly  all the  classes of Indian  population,  accomplishing  the ",
  "necessary social  mobilisation  for an impending  mass upsurge.  The ",
  "war also brought  disillusionment  for the educated  youth,  long mes\u00ad",
  "merised by the glitter of the West; suddenly they discovered the ugly ",
  "face of W estem civilisation.  It was, therefore, a climate of moral and ",
  "physical despondency  that greeted Gandhi,  arriving in India with his ",
  "background  of  a  successful  encounter  with  the  British  in  South ",
  "Africa. Gandhi's  novel political ideology, as Judith Brown has argued, ",
  "\"appealed  to few wholly, but to many partially\",  as everyone  could ",
  "find in it something  to identify with.19  Unlike the older  politicians, ",
  "he was fully aware of Indian pluralism  and took care not to alienate ",
  "any of the communities  or classes. The  earlier  politicians  wanted  a ",
  "hegemony  of a nationalist  ideology  built  on  ideas borrowed  from ",
  "the West,  while Gandhi  argued  that  the  ideology must be rooted  in ",
  "India  and  its  ancient  civilisation.  Popular  loyalties in India,  in  his ",
  "opinion,  were  not  determined  by the  institution  of class;  religion ",
  "had a stronger  influence on popular  mind. He therefore  successfully ",
  "used religious idioms to mobilise the masses. But this was not reviv\u00ad",
  "alism of the earlier politicians, as he was not referring to history, but ",
  "to religious morality. His goal was a moral goal, and therefore,  a uto\u00ad",
  "pian goal-unattainable  and ever-elusive. He talked  about  swaraj as ",
  "his political goal, but never defined it and therefore  could  unite dif\u00ad",
  "ferent  communities  under  his umbrella  type  leadership.  \"Inclusiv\u00ad",
  "ism\"  became  identified  as  \"Gandhi's  unique  style  of  polincs\",\" ",
  "which was based on a recognition  of the diversities of India. ",
  "Gandhi  derived his political ideas from various sources.  He drew ",
  "inspiration  from his reading  of Western  thinkers  like Henry  David ",
  "Thoreau, john  Ruskin,  Ralph  Waldo Emerson  or  Leo Tolstoy. He ",
  "was equally, if not more,  influenced  by Vaishnavism and Jainism,  as ",
  "he  was  exposed  to  these  ideas  during  his early  life in  Gujarat. 21 ",
  "Where Gandhian  philosophy differed significantly from those of the ",
  "earlier  nationalist  leaders  was that  he began  with  a trenchant  cri\u00ad",
  "tique  of  the  \"modem\"  civilisation-a  critique  which  has  evoked ",
  "mixed  responses  from his later commentators.  For Ashis Nandy,  he ",

  "Partha  Chatterjee,  his philosophy  represented  a \"critique  of civil ",
  "society\"  or to  put  it more  directly,  \"a fundamental  critique of the ",
  "entire edifice  of bourgeois  society\". 24  Manfred  Steger  (2000)  has ",
  "called it a \"critique  of liberalism\",  while for Bhikhu  Parekh, it is a ",
  "\"Critique of Modem  Civilisation\",  which  by way of providing  an ",
  "ideology to confront imperialism  also \"overlooked  some of its great ",
  "achievements  and strengths\".\" Gandhi's Collected  Works have now ",
  "run into more than one hundred volumes,  and his ideas on various ",
  "issues had been continually evolving.  It is therefore  difficult to make ",
  "an authoritative  statement on his philosophy.  Within the short space ",
  "that we have here an attempt  will be made only to highlight some ",
  "important  aspects of his political thinking. ",
  "In Hind  Swaraj  (1909),  a text  which  is often  privileged  as an ",
  "authentic  statement  of his ideology, Gandhi  offered  a civilisational ",
  "concept  of Indian nation.  The Indians constituted a nation or ",
  "praja, ",
  "he asserts, since the  pre-Islamic  days.26  The  ancient  Indian  civilisa\u00ad",

  "nationality,  as it had  an  immense  assimilative power  of absorbing ",
  "foreigners of different creed who made this country their own. This ",
  "civilisation,  which was \"sound at the foundation\" and which always ",
  "tended  \"to  elevate the moral being\", had  \"nothing  to  learn\"  from ",
  "the \"godless\" modem civilisation that only \"propagate[ d]  immoral\u00ad",
  "ity\".  Industrial  capitalism,  which  was the  essence of this modern ",
  "civilisation,  was held responsible  for all conflicts of interests,  for it ",
  "divorced  economic  activities  from  moral  concerns  and  thus  pro\u00ad",
  "vided imperatives for imperial  aggression.  Indians themselves  were ",
  "responsible  for their enslavement,  as they embraced  capitalism  and ",
  "its associated  legal and  political  structures.  \"The  English have not ",
  "taken  India;  we have given it to them.\" And now the railways,  law\u00ad",
  "yers and doctors, Gandhi  believed, were impoverishing the country. ",
  "His remedy for this national infliction was moral and utopian. Indi\u00ad",
  "ans must eschew greed and lust for consumption  and revert to vil\u00ad",
  "lage based self-sufficient  economy of the ancient times. On the other ",
  "hand, parliamentary democracy-the foundational  principle of West\u00ad",
  "ern liberal political system and therefore  another essential aspect of ",
  "modem  civilisation-did  not  reflect  in Gandhi's  view the  general ",
  "will of the people,  but  of the  political  parties,  which  represented ",
  "specific interests and constricted  the moral autonomy  of parliamen\u00ad",
  "tarians in the name of party discipline. So for him it was not enough ",

  "the Englishmen\"; it was also essential to evolve an Indian  alternative ",
  "to Western  liberal political structures.  His alternative  was a concept ",
  "of popular  sovereignty where  each individual  controls  or restrains ",
  "her/his  own  self and  this was  Gandhi's  subtle  distinction  between ",
  "self-rule  and  mere  home  rule.  \"[S]uch  swaraj\",  Gandhi  asserted, ",
  "\"has to be experienced  by each one for him elf.\"  If this was difficult ",
  "to attain, Gandhi  refused to consider  it as just a \"dream\".  \"To be\u00ad",
  "lieve that what has not occurred  in history  will not occur at all\", ",
  "Gandhi  replied  to his critic, \"is to argue  disbelief  in the  dignity  of ",
  "man.\" His technique to achieve it was satyagraha,  which he defined ",
  "as truth  force or soul force. In more practical  terms, it meant civil ",
  "disobedience-but  something  more than  that  It  was based  on the ",
  "premise of superior moral power of the protesters capable of chang\u00ad",
  "ing the heart  of the oppressor through a display of moral strength. ",
  "Non-violence  or ahimsa  was the  cardinal  principle  of his message ",
  "which was non-negotiable under all circumstances. 27 ",
  "It is not perhaps strictly correct to say that Gandhi  was rejecting ",
  "modernity as a package. Anthony Parel notes in his introduction to ",
  "Hind Swaraj  that this  text is presented  in  the genre of a dialogue ",
  "between a reader and an editor, \"a very modem figure\", with  Gan\u00ad",
  "dhi taking on this role.2s  Throughout his career he made utmost use ",
  "of the print media,  editing Indian  Opinion  during his South African ",
  "days, and then Young India and Harijan became the major communi\u00ad",
  "cators of his ideas. And he travelled  extensively by railways  while ",
  "organising  his campaigns.  Yet,  by offering an ideological critique of ",
  "the Western civilisation in its modern  phase,  Gandhi was effectively ",
  "contesting  the  moral  legitimacy  of the Raj  that  rested on a stated ",
  "assumption  of the  superiority  of the West. So far as his  methods ",
  "were concerned, Partha Chatterjee  has argued that they gave Gandhi ",
  "immense  manoeuvrability  in  terms  of real  politics.  There  was an ",
  "implicit recognition of an existing disjuncture between morality and ",
  "politics-the concept of ahimsa could bridge this gap. Failures could ",
  "be explained either in terms of the loftiness of the ideal or in terms ",
  "of imperfections  of human agency.29  But this ontological space for ",
  "manoeuvring  notwithstanding,  this problem of reconciling the prin\u00ad",
  "ciples  of non-violence with  the  realities  of nationalist  movement ",
  "proved to be a perpetual \"dilemma\"  that Gandhi had to negotiate ",
  "with  throughout his  career as a leader  of Indian nationalism,  and ",
  "this dilemma grew stronger over time as the movement  intensified.'? ",

  "THE  AGE OF GANDHIAN  POLITICS ",
  "of the Punjab extremists  and above all the Swadeshi movement  in ",
  "Bengal in  1905-8  had already  foreshadowed  the  coming  of agita\u00ad",
  "tional  politics  in India. And so far as mass mobilisation  was con\u00ad",
  "cerned,  the Home Rule Leagues of Tilak and Annie Besant prepared ",
  "the  ground  for  the  success of  Gandhi's  initial  saryagraha  move\u00ad",
  "ments.  Indeed,  when  in 1914, Tilak was released  from prison  and ",
  "Annie Besant, the World President of the Theosophical  Society, then ",
  "stationed  in  Madras,  joined  the  Congress,  they  wanted  to  steer ",
  "Indian politics to an almost similar direction. But although Tilak was ",
  "readmitted  to  Congress in 1915 due to Besant's intervention,  they ",
  "failed to reactivate the party out of its almost decade-long  inertia. In ",
  "frustration,  Tilak  started  his  Indian  Home  Rule  League  in  April ",
  "1916 and Besant her own All India Home  Rule League in Septem\u00ad",
  "ber-both  acting  at  tandem  and  in cooperation.  The  Home  Rule ",
  "movement  had a simple goal of promoting  Home Rule for India and ",
  "an educative  programme  to arouse  in the Indian  masses a sense of ",
  "pride in the Motherland. 31 ",
  "By 1917-18, when the government  came down heavily upon  the ",
  "Home  Rule Leagues, they had a membership  of about  sixty thou\u00ad",
  "sand  aU over  India,  most  importantly,  in areas  like Gujarat,  Sind, ",
  "United  Provinces, Bihar and parts of south  India,  which did not in ",
  "the  past  participate  in  nationalist  movement.  Yet, although  their ",
  "impact  fell on a much wider community  outside its direct  member\u00ad",
  "ship, the Leagues ultimately could not bring in mass agitational poli\u00ad",
  "tics in India.  In Madras,  Maharashtra  and Karnataka,  despite  some ",
  "untouchable  support,  the  Leagues being  under  Brahman  domina\u00ad",
  "tion,  invited the opposition  of the non-Brahmans.  But more signifi\u00ad",
  "cantly, Annie Besant, who was made the Congress President in 1917, ",
  "began to take a conciliatory attitude  towards the moderates,  particu\u00ad",
  "larly after  the  announcement  of the Montagu-Chelmsford  reform ",
  "proposals,  and put the passive resistance programme  on hold.  This ",
  "frustrated  the young extremist  leaders who provided  her main sup\u00ad",
  "port base and the Home Rule Leagues soon became defunct. Never\u00ad",
  "theless, many of the local leaders of Gandhi's  early satyagrahas came ",
  "from Home  Rule League background  and they used organisational ",
  "networks  created by the Leagues. ",
  "While Annie Besant failed, Gandhi  succeeded in uniting both  the ",
  "moderates  and extremists  on  a common  political  platform.  In the ",
  "divided and contestable space of Indian politics, he could effectively ",
  "claim  for himself a centrist  position,  because  he alienated  neither ",
  "and tactically combined the goal of the moderates  with the means of ",
  "the extremists.  He adopted  the moderates'  goal of swaraj, but  was https://telegram.me/UPSCMaterials https://telegram.me/FreeUPSCMaterials https://telegram.me/MaterialforExam",

  "revenue  remission.  Through  the  Gujarat Sabha  they got in touch ",
  "with Gandhi  in January  1918, but it was not until 22 March  that ",
  "Gandhi decided to launch a satyagraha in their support. Even then, ",
  "it was a \"patchy campaign\", as it affected only a few villages; often ",
  "the  peasants capitulated  to  government  pressure  and  often  they ",
  "crossed  the  boundaries  of Gandhian  politics  of non-violence.  By ",
  "April  the  Bombay government partially  fulfilled  the  peasants' de\u00ad",
  "mands by not confiscating the properties  of defaulting peasants who ",
  "could not pay, and in June Gandhi withdrew  the campaign.  Here ",
  "too the intervention of the Gujarat Sabha or its educated leaders like ",
  "Vallabhbhai and  Vithalbhai  Patel was of little  direct  consequence, ",
  "as a movement  had already been started and subsequently sustained ",
  "by the local leaders. Gandhi  made a solid political base in the villa\u00ad",
  "ges of Kheda district; but the support of the villagers was on their ",
  "own terms. When  Gandhi  returned with an appeal  for recruitment ",
  "for the army to fight in World War  One,  peasants rejected  it with ",
  "contempt.\" ",
  "In the middle of the Kheda saryagraha, Gandhi also got involved ",
  "in the Ahmedabadtextile mill strike ofFebruary-March  1918. Herc ",
  "his adversaries were the Gujarati millowners, who  were otherwise ",
  "very dose to him. The immediate reason for industrial conflict was ",
  "the withdrawal  of plague-bonus, which was being given to dissuade ",
  "workers from leaving the city in the face of mounting plague-related ",
  "deaths.  This withdrawal  came  at a time  when  the  workers  were ",
  "already facing hard times from unusual high prices caused by World ",
  "War  One,  and  there were  wildcat  strikes  and  the  formation  of a ",
  "weavers'  association.  Thus when  labour got restive  in Ahmedabad, ",
  "Gandhi  was invited  by Anusuya Sarabbai, a social worker, and  his ",
  "brother Ambalal Sarabhai,  the president of  the Ahmedabad  Mill\u00ad",
  "owners, Association, to intervene  as an arbitrator and defuse the cri\u00ad",
  "sis. But Gandhi's intervention  and the  formation  of an arbitration ",
  "board proved futile, as millowners demanded a complete  strike mor\u00ad",
  "atorium as a precondition  for any negotiated settlement. On 22 Feb\u00ad",
  "ruary when the srubbom millowners locked out the weavers, Gandhi ",
  "decided  to champion  the workers'  cause,  but persuaded  them  to ",
  "tone down  their demand  to a wage hike of 3 5 per cent,  instead  of ",
  "their original  demand of 5 0 per cent. He and his Sabarmati  ashram ",
  "volunteers  mobilised the workers  and held  regular  meetings where ",
  "initially  thousands  attended.  But  as  the  impasse  continued, the ",
  "millowners  stood  their ground  and the workers  began  to lose their ",
  "morale.  Gandhi  now  used his last weapon  of a hunger  strike;  the ",

  "per cent wage rise, this movement went a long way in mobilising and ",
  "organising  the working  classes in Ahmedabad,  paving  the  way for ",
  "the foundation  of the Textile Labour Association in February  1920. ",
  "But neither  labour  nor capital in Ahmedabad  showed  any evidence ",
  "of an ideological commitment  to the idea of \"arbitration\"  as a novel ",
  "Gandhian  technique  of resolving industrial  disputes.\" ",
  "Gandhi gained nationwide popularity  by championing these local\u00ad",
  "ised causes. Yet, if we look closely at these movements,  we will find ",
  "that  on  every  occasion  Gandhi  was invited  to  provide  leadership ",
  "where considerable mass mobilisation  had already taken place under ",
  "local  initiative.  The  masses interpreted  Gandhi's  message in their ",
  "own  terms  and  rumours  surrounding  the powers  of this messianic ",
  "leader served  to break  the barriers  of fear involved in confronting ",
  "formidable  enemies. And everywhere  the masses pushed  their own ",
  "agendas,  much  to  the  dislike of the elite nationalist  leaders  in the ",
  "regions. But in the process all these regions  became strongholds  of ",
  "political  support  for Gandhi,  as people  here  responded  eloquently ",
  "to his later calls for political action. But once again this activism fol\u00ad",
  "lowed trajectories that were vastly divergent from the one desired by ",
  "the leader. ",
  "In the Rowlatt  saryagraha  of 1919  Gandhi  sought  to  move to a ",
  "campaign  that  proposed  to  involve the  entire  nation;  but  here  too ",
  "we witness the same phenomenon,  i.e., overwhelming  mass support ",
  "for Gandhi but  for reasons  and  considerations  that  were  different ",
  "from those of the leader. The movement  was aimed against the two ",
  "bills prepared  by a committee  under Justice  S .A. T. Rowlatt,  to pro\u00ad",
  "vide the  government  with  additional  coercive  power  to deal with ",
  "terrorism.  One  of the  bills was passed  in the  Imperial  Legislative ",
  "Assembly on  18 March  1919  over  the  unanimous  protests  of the ",
  "Indian  members.  Ever since the content  of the bill was published, ",
  "Gandhi  proposed  to resist it with saryagraha. He was opposed  to the ",
  "spirit of the bill, which he described as the distrust for common  men. ",
  "It signified the  reluctance  of the government  to part  with arbitrary ",
  "powers  and  thus made a mockery  of the  democratic  constitutional ",
  "reforms.  Gandhi's  initial programme  was, however,  modest  along ",
  "with a few close associates he signed a saryagraha pledge on 24 Feb\u00ad",
  "ruary to disobey this and similar other  unjust laws. On 26 February ",
  "he issued an 'open  letter'  to all the Indians  urging them  to join the ",
  "satyagraha.  He decided  to launch a nationwide  movement,  starting ",
  "with  a general  strike or bartal on 6 April. But the  movement  soon ",
  "lapsed into  violence,  particularly  after  Gandhi's  arrest  on  9 April. https://telegram.me/UPSCMaterials https://telegram.me/FreeUPSCMaterials https://telegram.me/MaterialforExam",

  "The  government  had  no  prior  experience  of  handling  such  wide\u00ad",
  "spread  mass agitation.  To avoid  trouble  they arrested  Gandhi,  but ",
  "that  precipitated  a  crisis,  provoking  unprecedented  mob  fury  in ",
  "areas like Delhi, Bombay, Ahmedabad  or Amritsar.  Gandhi's trusted ",
  "volunteers  could not control  this mass violence and were themselves ",
  "swayed by it. The government  response was varied, as in the event of ",
  "a complete  breakdown  of communication,  provincial  governments ",
  "reacted according to their own preconceived  notions. In Bombay the ",
  "response  was restrained,  while  in Punjab,  Sir Michael  O'Dyer  un\u00ad",
  "leashed a reign of terror. The  worst violent incident was the massa\u00ad",
  "cre of jallianwallabagh  in the  city of Amritsar  on  13 April,  where ",
  "General  Dyer  opened  fire on  a  peaceful  gathering  of saryagrahis, ",
  "killing 379 people,  in a bid to break their  morale. ",
  "By mid-April the satyagraha  had started losing  momentum,  forc\u00ad",
  "ing Gandhi  to withdraw  it. As a political campaign,  therefore,  it was ",
  "a manifest failure, since it failed to secure its only aim, i.e., the repeal ",
  "of  the  Rowlatt  Act.  It  also  lapsed  into  violence,  although  it was ",
  "meant  to be  non-violent.  Gandhi  admitted  to  have  committed  a ",
  "Himalayan  blunder by offering  the weapon of saryagraha to a peo\u00ad",
  "ple insufficiently  trained  in the  discipline  of non-violence.  But  the ",
  "movement was significant nevertheless, as it was the first nationwide ",
  "popular  agitation,  marking  the  beginning  of a  transformation  of ",
  "Indian nationalist  politics from being the politics of some restricted ",
  "classes to becoming the politics of the masses. However,  having said ",
  "this,  we should  also  recognise  the  limits  of this  Gandhian  mass ",
  "movement.  The  whole  of India  literally was not  affected  and  the ",
  "movement  was more  effective in the  cities than  in the  rural  areas. ",
  "And here again the strength  of the movement  was due more to local ",
  "grievances,  like price  rise or scarcity of basic commodities,  than  to ",
  "protest  against the  Rowlatt  bills, about  which  there  was very  little ",
  "popular  awareness.  Finally,  the  effectiveness  of  the  movement ",
  "depended on the capability of the local leaders  to relate  local griev\u00ad",
  "ances to the national  issue of the Rowlatt  Act. ",
  "In other words,  in the absence of any central  organisation  and an ",

  "old students'  association,  and in 1913 a Quranic  school in Delhi,  to ",
  "reach the wider Muslim community  at a time when they were deeply ",
  "affected,  both  emotionally  and  politically,  by the  Balkan Wars.  In ",
  "Lucknow,  the  ulama  at the  Firangi  Mahal,  who  in  the  eighteenth ",
  "century  represented  a  rationalist  school  of  Islamic  learning,  had ",
  "been taking increasing interest in world Islam since the 1870s. 42 One ",
  "of them, Abdul Bari, along with the Ali brothers-Muhammad  and ",
  "Shaukat-now  opened  an All India Anjuman-e-Khuddam-e-Kaaba, ",
  "to  unite  all Indians  to  protect  Muslim  holy  places.  The  younger ",
  "Muslim leaders thus closed the distance, which Sayyid Ahmed would ",
  "prefer to maintain with the ulama, as they were more cager to forge ",
  "a community  of believers or umma, as opposed  to Sir Sayyid's qaum ",
  "or a community  of common  descent.\" ",
  "In the meanwhile,  the anti-Congress  and pro-government  attitude ",
  "of the Muslim League was also changing with the induction  of youn\u00ad",
  "ger  men,  like Muhammad  Ali, Wazir Hasan  or Abul Kalam Azad, ",
  "into  its leadership.  Muhammad  Ali Jinnah  was brought  in and  he ",
  "became a bridge between  the League and the  Congress.  These  ten\u00ad",
  "dencies became more prominent  when Britain declared  war against ",
  "Turkey in November  1914.  The  Muslims refused  to believe that  it ",
  "was a non-religious war, as leaders like Ali brothers with pro-Turkish ",
  "sympathies  were soon put  behind  bars. The Lucknow  Pact in 1916 ",
  "offered  a joint League-Congress  scheme for constitutional  reforms, ",
  "demanding representative government and dominion status for India. ",
  "The principle  of separate  electorate  was accepted,  and proportional ",
  "representation  in both imperial and provincial legislature was agreed ",
  "upon.  In 1917  the Muslim League supported  the Home  Ruic agita\u00ad",
  "tion started  by Annie Besant. But the outbreak  of communal  riots in ",
  "Bihar, United  Provinces and Bengal soon after  this rapprochement ",
  "revealed  the  continuing  disjunction  between  the  masses and  their ",
  "leaders. The latter's  lingering faith in constitutional  politics suffered ",
  "a  further  jolt  when  the  Montagu-Chelmsford  Reforms  in  1919 ",
  "totally disregarded  the Lucknow Pact and the Muslim University Bill ",
  "passed in September  1920 provided  for a non-affiliating  university ",
  "under  strict  government  control.  The  defeat  of Turkey created  the ",
  "spectre  of Islam in danger,  an issue that  could  be used to mobilise ",
  "mass support.  The  result of these developments  was a shift in Mus\u00ad",
  "lim League leadership  from the moderate  constitutionalists  to those ",
  "who  believed  in  Islamic  religious  self-assertion  and  broad-based ",
  "mass movement.  The Delhi session of the Muslim League in Decem\u00ad",
  "ber 1918 invited the ulama and gave them public prominence,\"  thus ",
  "for the first time bringing them directly into the political centrestage. https://telegram.me/UPSCMaterials https://telegram.me/FreeUPSCMaterials https://telegram.me/MaterialforExam",
  "THE  299 ",
  "AGE OF GANDHIAN  PolmCS ",
  "The context  was thus prepared  for the beginning of Khilafat move\u00ad",
  "ment, the first mass agitation to forge political unity among a divided ",
  "Indian Muslim community. ",
  "Behind  the Khilafat movement  were the rumours  about  a harsh ",
  "peace treaty  being imposed on the Ottoman  Emperor  who was still ",
  "regarded  as the KhaJifa or the spiritual  head of the  Islamic world. ",
  "The movement, launched by a Khilafat Committee  formed in Bom\u00ad",
  "bay in March  1919,  had  three main  demands:  the  Khalifa  must ",
  "retain control  over the Muslim holy places; he must be left with his ",
  "pre-war territories so that he could maintain his position  as the head ",
  "of the Islamic world; and thejazirat-ul-Arab (Arabia, Syria, Iraq and ",
  "Palestine)  must not be under  non-Muslim sovereignty. It was thus a ",
  "pan-Islamic movement  in all its appearance, as the cause had noth\u00ad",
  "ing to do with  India. But as Gail Minault  has shown,  the  Khilafat ",
  "was being used more as a symbol, while the leaders actually had little ",
  "concern  about altering the political realities in the Middle East. It ",
  "was found  to be a symbol that could  unite the Indian Muslim com\u00ad",
  "munity divided  along many fault-lines, such as regional,  linguistic, ",
  "class and sectarian. To use Minault's words: \"A pan-Islamic symbol ",
  "opened  the  way to  pan-Indian  Islamic  political mobilization. \"45  It ",
  "was anti-British,  which inspired  Gandhi  to support  this cause in a ",
  "bid to bring the Muslims into the mainstream of Indian nationalism. ",
  "Initially the Khilafat movement had two broad trends:  a moderate ",
  "trend  headed  by  the Bombay  merchants  and  a  radical  trend  led ",
  "by the younger Muslim leaders,  like Muhammad  Ali,  Shaukat Ali, ",
  "Maulana Azad and  the  ulama. The  former group  preferred  to  pro\u00ad",
  "ceed through the familiar constitutional path of sending a delegation ",
  "to the viceroy or ensuring Muslim representation  in the Paris Peace ",
  "Conference.  The latter group on the other hand, wanted  a mass agi\u00ad",
  "tation against the British on the basis of unity with the Hindus. Gan\u00ad",
  "dhi took  up the Khilafat cause and initially  played a mediating  role ",
  "between  the moderates and  the radicals. The  moderates  began  to ",
  "lose ground  when  the delegation headed  by Dr Ansari and partici\u00ad",
  "pated by Muhammad  Ali himself, met the viceroy, then Prime Minis\u00ad",
  "ter Lloyd George and then visited Paris, but returned empty-handed. ",
  "The radicals then took  charge of the movement,  as emotions ran ",
  "high after the publication  of the terms of the Treaty of Sevres with ",
  "Turkey in May 1920.  In the same month,  the Hunter Commission ",
  "Majority Report  was published,  and it did not seem strong enough ",
  "in condemning General Dyer's role in the Jallianwallabagh  massa\u00ad",
  "cre.  This  infuriated Indian  public  opinion.  The  Allahabad  confer\u00ad",

  "300  FROM PLASSEY TO PARTITION ",
  "decided  to launch  a four stage non-cooperation  movement: boycott ",
  "of titles, civil services, police and army and finally non-payment of ",
  "taxes. The  whole movement was to begin with a hartal on 1 August. ",
  "Muslim  opinion  on non-cooperation  was still divided  and through\u00ad",
  "out the summer of 1920 Gandhi and Shaukat Ali toured  extensively ",
  "mobilising  popular  support  for  the  programme.  The hartal  was a ",
  "grand success, as it coincided  with  the death ofTilak, and from then ",
  "on support for non-cooperation  began to rise. Gandhi now pressed ",
  "the  Congress to adopt  a similar  plan  of campaign  on  three issues: ",
  "Punjab  wrong,  Khilafat  wrong and  swaraj.  In  an  article  in  Young ",
  "India he  announced  that  through  this  movement  he  would  bring ",
  "swaraj  one  year.  He did  not, however,  define what this  swaraj ",
  "in ",
  "would actually  mean. ",
  "The established  politicians of the  Congress still had their doubts ",
  "about  a non-cooperation programme.  they had no experience ",
  "As  in ",
  "mass agitation,  it appeared  to be a leap  in the dark. There was an ",
  "apprehension  that it might lead  to violence which  would  delay  the ",
  "implementation  ofthe new constitutional reform, since the elections ",
  "to the reformed councils were  scheduled  for November  1920.  On ",
  "the other hand, support for Gandhi's proposal  for a non-cooperation ",
  "movement came from the politically backward provinces and groups, ",
  "which  were not hitherto  involved in Congress politics. Between  Sep\u00ad",
  "tember and December 1920 the Congress witnessed a tussle between ",
  "these  two grol;lps,  as neither  side wanted  a split and  searched  for a ",
  "consensus.  A special session  of the Congress was convened  at Cal\u00ad",
  "cutta on  4-9  September  1920, where  Gandhi's  resolution  on non\u00ad",
  "cooperation  programme  was  approved  over  a  qualifying  amend\u00ad",
  "ment from Bepin Chandra Pal of Bengal,  and despite stiff opposition ",
  "from the old guards,  like C.R. Das, Jinnah or Pal. The  programme ",
  "provided  for surrender  of  government  titles,  boycott  of schools, ",
  "courts  and  councils,  boycort  of  foreign  goods,  encouragement  of ",
  "national  schools,  arbitration  courts  and  khadi  (homespun  cloth). ",
  "The  programme was then  endorsed  at the regular  session  of the ",
  "Congress at Nagpur  in December  1920.  Here  too  opposition  came ",
  "from Das,  who sought to turn the table against  Gandhi by propos\u00ad",
  "ing  a  more  radical programme.  But ultimately a compromise was ",
  "reached, as Das turned over to Gandhi's side. The resolution accepted ",
  "all parts of the non-cooperation  programme, but it was to be imple\u00ad",
  "menred  in stages, as directed  by the All India Congress Committee. ",
  "The movement,  Gandhi assured, would bring swaraj within one year. ",
  "If that did not happen  or if government  resorted  to repression,  then ",
  "a civil disobedience  campaign  was to be launched,  involving  non-https://telegram.me/UPSCMaterials https://telegram.me/FreeUPSCMaterials https://telegram.me/MaterialforExam",
  "302  FROM PLASSEY TO PARTITION ",
  "and  recruiting  an equal  number  of volunteers.  Gradually,  the move\u00ad",
  "ment became  more militant,  with the beginning  ofboycott and organ\u00ad",
  "isation  of  public  bonfires  of foreign  cloth  A nationwide  strike  was ",
  "observed  on  17  November,  the  day the  Prince  of Wales  arrived  in ",
  "India  on an  official  visit.  On  that  day  Bombay  witnessed  the  out\u00ad",
  "break of the first violent  riot of the movement,  targeting  the Europe\u00ad",
  "ans,  Anglo-Indians  and  the  Parsis  in  the  city.  Gandhi  was  incensed; ",
  "full-scale  civil disobedience  or a no tax campaign  was postponed;  it ",
  "was  decided  that  an  experimental  no  revenue  campaign  would  be ",
  "launched  at  Bardoli  in  Gujarat  in Februa 1922.  The  venue  was ",
  "ry ",
  "carefully  chosen,  as it was  a  otwari  area,  with  no zamindars  and ",
  "ry",
  "therefore  no  danger  of a no-revenue  campaign  snowballing  into  a ",
  "no-rent  campaign  tearing  apart  the  fragile  coalition  of  classes.  But ",
  "this never happened,  as before  that the Non-cooperation  movement ",
  "was withdrawn. ",
  "The  extent  of success  of the  non-cooperation  movement  would ",
  "not  definitely  give  Gandhi  total satisfaction.  Middle-class  participa\u00ad",
  "tion  was  not  spectacular,  as  revealed  in  the  figures  for  school, ",
  "colleges and court boycotts,  while peasant and working  class partici\u00ad",
  "pation  was  more  impressive.  Except  in  Madras,  council  election ",
  "boycott  was more  or less successful,  with the  polling  average  being ",
  "5-8 per cent.  Economic  boycott  was more intense  and  successful,  as ",
  "the value  of imports  of foreign  cloth  dropped  from  Rs.  1,020  mil\u00ad",
  "1920-21  1921-22. ",
  "lion in  to Rs.  570  million  in  The  import of Brit\u00ad",
  "ish  cotton  piece  goods  also  declined  from  1,292  million  to  955 ",
  "million  yards  during  the  same  period.51  Partly  responsible  for  this ",
  "success  was trader  participation,  as the businessmen  pledged  not  to ",
  "1918-",
  "indent  foreign  cloth  for specific  periods.  During  the  period ",
  "22, while the large  industrialists  remained  anti-non-cooperation  and ",
  "pro-government,  the Marwari  and  Gujarati  merchants,  aggrieved  by ",
  "the  falling  exchange  rates  and  the  taxation  policy  of the  govern\u00ad",
  "52 ",
  "ment,  remained  \"fairly  consistently  pro-nationalist\".  However, ",
  "their  refusal  to import  foreign  cloth  might  have  also  been  due  to a ",
  "sudden  fall in  rupee-sterling  exchange  rates  that  made  import  ex\u00ad",
  "tremely unprofitable.P  Production  of handloom,  on the other hand, ",
  "also increased,  but no definite statistics are available  for that. Together ",
  "with  non-cooperation,  there  were  other  associated  Gandhian  social ",
  "movements,  which  also achieved  some success.  Temperance  or anti\u00ad",
  "liquor campaign  resulted  in si ificant  drop in liquor excise revenue ",

  "303 ",
  "THE AGE OF GANDHIAN POLITICS ",
  "for the Congressmen,  though for the first time Gandhi had brought ",
  "this  issue to the forefront  of nationalist  politics by inserting  in  the ",
  "historic 1920 resolution an appeal \"to rid Hinduism of the reproach ",
  "of untouchabiliry\".\"  The emphasis of the movement  was always on ",
  "the unifying issues and on trying to cut across or reconcile  class and ",
  "communal  disjunctions. ",
  "The most significant  aspects of the Non-cooperation  movement ",
  "were,  however, its uneven  geographical  spread  and  wide  regional ",
  "variations. First of all, it was marked by the involvement  of regions ",
  "and classes that did not participate in the past in any movement initi\u00ad",
  "ated by the Congress. There was significant peasant participation  in ",
  "Rajasthan, Sind, Gujarat, Awadh, Assam and Maharashtra, although ",
  "in some  cases such  peasant  movements  were  autonomous  of any ",
  "Congress organisational  intervention.  Of the four linguistic regions ",
  "in  ourh  India,  three were  effectively  brought  into  the  movement, ",
  "while Karnataka  remained  unaffected. There  were some non-Brah\u00ad",
  "man lower-caste participation  in Madras  and Maharashtra,  power\u00ad",
  "ful  tribal  movements  in Andhra  delta  and  Bengal  in  the  form  of ",
  "forest saryagraha,  labour unrest in Madras, Bengal and Assam, trad\u00ad",
  "ers' participation in Bombay and Bengal.  But on the other hand,  the ",
  "masses often crossed the limits of Gandhian  creed  of non-violence. ",
  "Gandhi  himself condemned the unruly  mob,  but failed  to  restrain ",
  "them.  And  this was the main  reason  why  he hesitated  to begin  a ",
  "full-fledged civil disobedience or a no-revenue  campaign.  The  final ",
  "threshold  was reached in the Chauri Chaura incident in Gorakhpur ",
  "district ofUtrar Pradesh on 4 February  1922, when villagers burned ",
  "alive  twenty-two  policemen  in  the  local  police  station.  Here  the ",
  "local  volunteers  had  gathered  to protest  against  police  oppression ",
  "and the sale and high prices of certain  articles. The police  initially ",
  "sought to deter them by firing in the air. This was interpreted by the ",
  "crowd  as a sign  of fear, as bullets were turning  into water  \"by  the ",
  "grace of Gandhiji\".  The  crowd then  marched  towards the market, ",
  "threw brickbats  at the police and  when  the latter  opened  real fire, ",
  "they were chased into the thana, which was then set on fire. For the ",
  "Gandhian  volunteers the destruction of the thana only signalled the ",
  "coming of the Gandhi raj .55 But for Gandhi it confirmed  the absence ",
  "of an environment of non-violence,  as the stench of the Bombay riot ",
  "greeting the Prince of Wales in September 1921  was still fresh in his ",
  "nostrils,  as he described  it.  The  Non-cooperation  movement was, ",
  "therefore, withdrawn  on 11 February 1922, followed by the Bardoli ",
  "resolution, which emphasised  the need for constructive work before ",
  "beginning any political agitation. Gandhi was criticised  by his own https://telegram.me/UPSCMaterials https://telegram.me/FreeUPSCMaterials https://telegram.me/MaterialforExam",

  "Congressmen,  particularly  the  younger  elements,  for withdrawing ",
  "the movement when it had reached its peak. But he stood firm in his ",
  "faith  in  non-violence  and  refused  to  budge.  He  was  arrested  on ",
  "10 March  1922 and was sentenced  to prison for six years. Officially ",
  "the Congress-led Non-cooperation  movement ended, but in different ",
  "localities it continued  despite official withdrawal. ",
  "Gradually  the Khilafat movement  too  died.  It had proved  to  be ",
  "another  problem  for Gandhi, as the attitudes  of the Khilafat leaders ",
  "increasingly revealed that they had accepted  the Gandhian  creed of ",
  "non-violence  more as a matter of convenience  to take advantage  of ",
  "Gandhi's  charismatic  appeal,  rather  than  as a  matter  of faith.  By ",
  "bringing  in the ulama and by overtly using a religious symbol, the ",
  "movement  evoked  religious  emotions  among  the  Muslim  masses. ",
  "Violent tendencies soon appeared  in the Khilafat movement,  as the ",
  "masses lost self-discipline and the leaders failed to control  them. The ",
  "worst-case  scenario was the Moplah  uprising in Malabar,  where the ",
  "poor  Moplah  peasants,  emboldened  by  the  Khilafat  spirit,  rose ",
  "against the Hindu  moneylenders  and the state. 56 There was also fac\u00ad",
  "tionalism within the Khilafat Committee,  as the breach between the ",
  "ulama,  allied with  the radical leaders who wanted  to move beyond ",
  "non-violence, and the  moderates  who preferred  to  stay with  Gan\u00ad",
  "dhi, began to widen. There were differences between Gandhi on the ",
  "one hand and the Ali brothers  and Abdul Bari on the other over the ",
  "issue of escalating use of religious rhetoric. By the end of 1921, with ",
  "the outbreak  of the Moplah  uprising in Malabar,  followed by other ",
  "communal  riots  in  various  parts  of the  subcontinent  in  1922-23, ",
  "there  was a visible breach in the  Hindu-Muslim  alliance. The sym\u00ad",
  "bol itself, around  which Muslim mass mobilisation  had taken place, ",
  "soon lost its significance, as a nationalist  revolution  in Turkey abol\u00ad",
  "ished monarchy or the Khilafat in 1924. In India the Khilafat move\u00ad",
  "ment  hereafter  died  down,  but  the  religious  emotions  which  it ",
  "had articulated  continued  to persist, matched  by an equally militant ",
  "Hindu  radicalism. ",
  "The Non-Cooperarion-Khilafar  movement,  however, raises many ",
  "issues about the nature of mass movement in India under the leader\u00ad",
  "ship  of  the  Gandhian  Congress.  In different  regions,  as we  have ",
  "noted earlier, the movement took different shapes. In all the regions ",
  "the movement  was initially confined  to the cities and small towns, ",
  "where it was primarily dependent  on middle class participation  that ",
  "gradually  declined.  There  was low tum  out  at the council  election ",
  "almost everywhere;  but an exception  was Madras,  where  very few ",
  "candidates  actually  withdrew  and  the  justice  Party  returned  as a https://telegram.me/UPSCMaterials https://telegram.me/FreeUPSCMaterials https://telegram.me/MaterialforExam",

  "majority  party  in the  legislature.\"  In Madras,  the  movement  wit\u00ad",
  "nessed from the very beginning  a Brahman-non-Brahman  conflict, ",
  "as the Justice  Party launched  an active campaign  against the  'Brah\u00ad",
  "man'  Congress  and  its non-cooperation  programme  and  rallied  in ",
  "support  of the Montagu-Chelmsford  Reforms. Because of this resis\u00ad",
  "tance, the  boycott  of foreign  cloth  was also  much  weaker  in  the ",
  "Tamil regions  than  in other provinces  of India.s1 The  development ",
  "of national schools and arbitration  courts and khadi did not succeed ",
  "everywhere  either.  In Nagpur  division, for example,  the inadequacy ",
  "of national  schools forced students  to get back to government  edu\u00ad",
  "cational  institutions. As arbitration  courts  became defunct,  lawyers ",
  "got back to their usual legal practice. 59 In most areas, khadi was 30 to ",
  "40 per cent more expensive than micllothl, re sulting iints u npopular\u00ad",
  "ity among  the  poor  people. 60  In many  cases, such  as in the  small ",
  "towns of Gujarat,  mobilisation depended  on local issues, like temple ",
  "politics,  control  over  municipalities  or  control  over  educational ",
  "institutions'1  or in the south  Indian towns  grievances against  rising ",
  "municipal  taxes or the income tax.  In Tamilnad,  the success of the ",
  "temperance  movement  depended  on various social motives, such as ",
  "the Sanskritising tendencies of the upwardly  mobile castes and local ",
  "factionalism. '2  In some  other  areas,  mobilisation  to  a\ufffd extent de\u00ad",
  "pended  on  personal  influence  of local leaders,  such as C.R. Das in ",
  "Bengal, whose  personal  sacrificer-giving up a lucrative legal prac\u00ad",
  "tice, for example-inspired  the younger generation. '3 ",
  "In  Punjab,  on  the  other  hand,  the  Akali  movement  has  been ",
  "described  by Richard  Fox as representing  \"the  largest and  longest ",
  "application  of the  Gandhian  programme  of  satyagraha,  or  non\u00ad",
  "violent  resistance. 1164 However,  ifwe look closely at this movement, ",
  "we will find  that it had  very little  direct  relevance  to  his non-co\u00ad",
  "operation  programme. Tracing its origins from the wider  reformist ",
  "Singh Sabha movement  of the  late nineteenth  century  (sec chapter ",
  "5. 2),  this  particular  campaign  started  in  October  1920  when  a ",
  "Siromoni  Gurdwara  Prabandhak  Committee  (SGPC) was  formed. ",
  "Its aims were to reform the Sikh gurdwaras and to reclaim control  of ",
  "the Sikh shrines from the hands of the government  manipulated  loy\u00ad",
  "alist committees that included non-Sikhs. In December, as an auxil\u00ad",
  "iary of the  SGPC the Akali Dal was formed  to coordinate jathas  to ",
  "wrest control of the shrines, the name Akali (\"servants of the Eternal ",
  "God\") being derived from the small band of martyr-warriors formed ",
  "to defend  the  faith during  the time of Ranjit  Singh.65 Already irri\u00ad",

  "FROM PLASSEY TO PARTmON ",
  "massacre,  the Akalis  came to a head-on  collision  with  the govern\u00ad",
  "ment when in early 1921  it took the keys of the Golden  Temple  at ",
  "Amritsar and appointed a new manager. When the Akalis protested, ",
  "the government  once  more  unleashed  a repressive regime,  and  the ",
  "latter  responded  with  satyagraha.  Gandhi  and  the  Congress sup\u00ad",
  "ported  the campaign,  which  ultimately  forced  the government  to ",
  "surrender  the keys and administration  of the temple  to the Akalis. ",
  "But the middle-class  Sikh leadership  had  only selectively  adopted ",
  "the non-cooperation  programme  and  once  their  limited  goal  was ",
  "achieved,  did not allow their distinctive religious struggle to be com\u00ad",
  "pletely appropriated  by the Congress agitation. 66 ",
  "As urban middle-class enthusiasm soon petered  out all over India, ",
  "business interest was also vacillating.  While the larger  Indian capital\u00ad",
  "ists opposed the non-cooperation programme  from the very begin\u00ad",
  "ning, smaller traders and merchants continued  to use their networks ",
  "to promote hartal and generously donated  money to the Tilak Swaraj ",
  "Fund.  But  they  too  opposed  a  total  boycott  of  foreign  goods. 67 ",
  "Attempts to involve the working classes also ran into problems. For ",
  "instance,  an experiment  to involve the tea garden labourers  in Assam ",
  "ended  up in a disaster at Chandpur  which was condemned  severely ",
  "by  Gandhi.  Dependence  on  the  capitalists  prevented  the  leaders ",
  "from  mobilising  the  working  class, as Gandhi  continually  insisted ",
  "that the movement should maintain harmonious capital-labour rela\u00ad",
  "tionship. 68 In Nagpur and Berar, the Gandhians achieved some influ\u00ad",
  "ence over  the working  classes,  but  this  hardly  had  any significant ",
  "impact  on  the overall  momentum  of  the Non-cooperation  move\u00ad",
  "ment in the region 69 And where labour  unrest turned  violent,  as in ",
  "Madras, the local leaders quickly washed their hands off, forcing the ",
  "striking  workers to submit to the authorities.  This disheartened  the ",

  "The  non-cooperation  movement  was  most  effective  where  the ",

  "at  the grassroots  level by local leader  Baba Ramchandra,  was later ",
  "harnessed  by the UP Kisan  Sabha  which  was launched  in February ",
  "1918 in Allahabad.  By June  1919 the Kisan Sabha had 450 branches ",

  "became most powerful  in those areas which witnessed the previous ",
  "anti-planter  agitation,  Swami Viswananda's  campaign  and  Kisan ",
  "Sabha acrivities.\"  In the Midnapur  district  of Bengal the Mahishya ",
  "peasants had been organised in 1919 against the Union Board taxes ",
  "by a local leader  B.N. Sasmal;  later on this movement too  merged ",
  "into the  non-cooperation  campaign.\"  In certain  regions of Orissa, ",
  "like Kanika  for example,  the existing  tradition  of peasant  melis or ",
  "anti-feudal demonstrations  continuing since the nineteenth  century, ",
  "was later  on incorporated into the non-cooperation movement. 74 In ",
  "the  Kheda  district  of  Gujarat,  the  Paridar  peasants  had  already ",
  "launched  a successful no-revenue campaign in 1918 and they were ",
  "again preparing  for another  round  of stir;  this district for obvious ",
  "reasons, therefore,  became the strongest bastion of non-cooperation ",
  "movement.  In south India, between December 1921 and February ",
  "75 ",
  "1922 there was a \"brief and sporadic\" no-revenue  campaign  in the ",
  "Godavari,  Krishna and  Guntur  districts in the Andhra  delta.  Here ",
  "the  village  officials,  through  whom  the  revenue  was  collected, ",
  "resigned and the peasants hoping for a collapse of the government, ",
  "stopped  paying the revenue. But when the government  instituted an ",
  "inquiry  into  their  grievances and  threatened  to arrest  the  leaders ",
  "who would not give up, the agitation subsided within  weeks. In both ",
  "these cases, the  momentum  of the agitations was slowly mounting ",
  "for quite some  rime,  at least since 1918-19,  and  these  were  then ",
  "integrated  into  the  non-cooperation  movement. 76  In  other  areas, ",
  "where there was no pre-history of peasant mobilisation, the response ",
  "of the  countryside was rather  muted  This  shows  that  it was the ",
  "internal  dynamics of the  regions that accounted  for the success of ",
  "the  non-cooperation  movement, rather than  the Congress mobilis\u00ad",
  "ing an as yet inert peasantry into an organised nationalist campaign. ",
  "The  Non-cooperation  movement  remained  more under  the con\u00ad",
  "trol  of the Congress  leaders  where  there  were homogeneous  and ",
  "dominant  peasant communities  holding sway over lower caste agri\u00ad",
  "cultural labourers, such as the Mahishya  peasant caste in Bengal or ",
  "the Patidar  peasant caste in Gujarat.  Here local leaders had greater ",
  "control through caste organisations and other community  and kin\u00ad",
  "ship  networks.  Even here,  the  peasants showed  considerable  self\u00ad",
  "initiative:  the Paridar peasants had  started  a no-revenue  campaign ",
  "even without the formal approval of the Congress. Then  the with\u00ad",
  "drawal of the movement so disheartened  them that when their lead\u00ad",
  "ers  wanted  to mobilise them  again in 1922, they simply refused  to https://telegram.me/UPSCMaterials https://telegram.me/FreeUPSCMaterials https://telegram.me/MaterialforExam",
  "308 ",
  "FROM PWSEY  TO PARTITION ",
  "respond.n Such self-initiative was more clearly discernible where no ",
  "such homogenous  peasant  groups could be found.  In some parts  of ",
  "Orissa,  for example,  peasants stopped  paying rents and fore st taxes ",
  "against  the  wishes  of their  local  Congress  leaders  and  continued ",
  "their stir even after  its formal  withdrawal  by the  Congress. 71 Else\u00ad",

  "mobilisation,  the peasants  were  more  uncontrolled. They  interpre\u00ad",
  "ted  Gandhi  in their  own  varied  ways  and  tried  to  combine  the ",
  "nationalist  movement  with  their  own  struggle  against  taluqdari ",
  "oppression.  Attacks on taluqdari  property  increased in the winter  of ",
  "1921-22  and the Congress found  it too difficult to control.  Gandhi ",
  "visited UP and criticised the peasants for turning  violent,  but with no ",
  "appreciable  results.  So the  Congress  decided  to abandon  it;  Baba ",
  "Ramchandra  was  arrested  and  the  movement  was  severely  re\u00ad",
  "pressed,  but the local Congress did not raise a finger. 79 For the peas\u00ad",
  "ants  in Gorakhpur,  for  instance,  Gandhi  represented  a symbol  of ",
  "deliverance  from  day-to-day  oppression.  There  were  rumours  all ",
  "around  which  showed  that  to  the  peasants  swaraj  meant  a millen\u00ad",
  "ium, a utopian  state where  there  would  be no rent,  no revenue,  no ",
  "repayment  of loans,  no zamindar  or  taluqdar.  It  was  a situation ",
  "which the peasants in their imagination  had always desired.  Gandhi ",
  "had thus appealed  to their imagination  and fired them into action. \u2022o ",
  "On the other hand,  in Punjab after  the Amritsar  victory  the Akali ",
  "campaign  moved  to the countryside, wresting  control  of the Guru\u00ad",
  "ka-bagh shrine in Novemeber  1922, i.e., long after the non-coopera\u00ad",
  "tion movement  had been formally withdrawn.  By January  1923 they ",
  "had  taken  control  of about  one  hundred  shrines,  and then in Sep\u00ad",
  "tember,  when the government  deposed the ruler of the princely state ",
  "of N abha for his alleged support to the Akalis, the latter launched  a ",
  "militant  anti-colonial  campaign  in Jaito for his restoration.  During ",
  "its  rural  phase  the Akali movement  at various  places  crossed  the ",
  "boundary  of non-violent  movement,  and the peasants  openly defied ",
  "the authority  of the Raj. Gandhi  withdrew  his support at this point ",
  "as he disapproved  of the campaign for the deposed N abha ruler. The ",
  "government  now  came down  heavily on the Akalis, but ultimately ",
  "patched  up a compromise  for fear of affecting the loyalty of the Sikh ",
  "soldiers. The Gurdwara  Reform Act of 1925 restored  the control of ",
  "the  shrines  to  Sikh management.  But as the  movement  was with\u00ad",

  "relations.n  In the election  of  1925-26  religious  issues were  freely ",
  "exploited by Hindu orthodox  groups led by Madan Mohan Malaviya, ",
  "resulting  in the defeat of the secularist Motilal Nehru. As a corollary, ",
  "Hindu  nationalist  organisations,  like  the  All India  Hindu  Maha\u00ad",
  "sabha  gained  in strength  in north  and  central  India;  its close and ",

  "secular  image  and  led  to  further  alienation  of  the  Muslims  from ",
  "mainstream  nationalism.\"  The  untouchables  too,  whom  Gandhi ",
  "called  Harijan  (God's  people),  were  frustrated  as the  campaign to ",
  "ameliorate their conditions received lukewarm  response throughout ",
  "India .. They were  first organised  in 1926  under  the  banner  of an ",
  "exclusive organisation  by Rao Bahadur  M.C. Rajah; but in  1930  Dr ",
  "B.R.  Ambedkar  organised  them into an All India Depressed  Classes ",
  "Congress with a clear anti-Congress  agenda  (more in chapter 7.2). ",
  "However,  despite  such  fissures in  organised  political  life, there ",
  "were, on the other  hand,  some significant changes that prepared  the ",
  "ground  for another  round  of mass agitation  against the British Raj. ",
  "First of all,  a major crisis for the export-oriented  colonial  economy ",
  "culminated  in the great depression  in the late 1920s.  The  prices of ",
  "exportable  agricultural cash crops went down steeply-by  about 50 ",
  "per cent in general-affecting  the rich  peasantry. The prices of some ",
  "cash crops fell more drastically than others. The price of cotton,  for ",
  "example,  grown  in  Punjab,  Gujarat  and  Maharashtra,  fell  from ",
  "Rs. 0.70 per pound in the mid-1920s  to Rs. 0.22 in 1930. The price ",
  "of wheat within a year fell from Rs. 5 to Rs. 3 per maund  between ",
  "1929  and 1930. The price of rice began to faJI a little later, from the ",
  "beginning  of 1931,  when  the jute  market  also  crashed  in  Bengal. ",
  "While the income of the peasantry was going down,  the amount of ",
  "revenue,  settled  previously in a condition  of high  prices, remained ",
  "static,  as government  was not  prepared  to allow  any remission  to ",
  "accommodate  the  price  fall, still widely believed  to be a temporary https://telegram.me/UPSCMaterials https://telegram.me/FreeUPSCMaterials https://telegram.me/MaterialforExam",
  "313 ",
  "THE AGE OF GANDHIAN POLITICS ",
  "phenomenon: As landlords  remained under pressure to pay revenue, ",
  "there was no relenting in the pressure of rent on the tenants. And in ",
  "such a situation  debt servicing became a problem,  as moneylenders ",
  "were now more  keen in recovering their capital.  In many areas the ",
  "flow of rural credit  dried  up and the  peasants were  forced  to sell ",
  "parts  of their  land to raise the capital to  keep cultivation  going.94 ",
  "However,  the  situation  varied  from  region  to  region,  and  even ",
  "within  the same region  such as Bengal, as Sugata Bose has shown, ",
  "the effect varied widely depending  on the structure  of peasant soci\u00ad",
  "ety and organisation  of production. 9S ",
  "This situation  helped Congress to mobilise the  rich peasants and ",
  "small holders in various parts of the country, such as Bengal, coastal ",
  "Andhra or UP. In the latter  area, repeated  crop failures and shortfall ",
  "in the  production  of food crops also added  to the  miseries  of the ",
  "poor  peasants. This led to  the organisation  of peasant  movements ",
  "outside the Congress, as it was clearly not  interested  in mobilising ",
  "such potentially  radical lower  peasant  groups.  In Bengal too,  poor ",
  "Muslim,  untouchable Namasudra  and tribal Santhal peasants mobi\u00ad",
  "lised  around  radical  agrarian  demands in  1928-29,  representing ",
  "what Tanika Sarkar  has described as \"a parallel stream of protest\" .96 ",
  "The environment  was certainly conducive for a mass agitation  if the ",
  "local Congress leaders  could relate the specific grievances  of these ",
  "peasants  to the broader  national agenda of swaraj. But  their  major ",
  "challenge  was to  reconcile  the  interests  of the  richer  landowning ",
  "peasants with the concerns of the labouring agricultural workers and ",
  "tenants. ",
  "The other important  development was the emergence of a capital\u00ad",
  "ist class during  and in the years immediately following World War ",
  "One. Fiscal needs forced the Government  of India to impose protec\u00ad",
  "tive tariffs,  pushing the prices of imported  articles up, and thus help\u00ad",
  "ing unintentionally  Indian industrialisation.  As a result, in the 1920s ",
  "there  was a  powerful  and  conscious  Indian  capitalist  class which ",
  "organised  itself  in  1927  under  the  banner  of  the  Federation  of ",
  "Indian  Chambers  of  Commerce  and  Industries  (FICCI).  This  was ",
  "also the time when the Indian bourgeoisie was coming into  conflict ",
  "with  the  imperial  government  on  many issues. Their  usual way of ",
  "handling the situation was to operate as a pressure group; but increas\u00ad",
  "ingly  their  leaders  like  G.D.  Birla or  Purushottamdas  Thakurdas ",
  "and even the moderate  Lalji Naranji were coming to the conclusion ",
  "that  they would  do better  if they sided with  the Congress to  fight ",
  "their battle. Many of the captains of Indian industries were the cot\u00ad",
  "ton mill owners of western  India,  who had reached the threshold  of https://telegram.me/UPSCMaterials https://telegram.me/FreeUPSCMaterials https://telegram.me/MaterialforExam",

  "FROM PLASSEYTO PARTITION ",
  "endurance  a  a result of depression  and competition  from cheap Jap\u00ad",
  "anese textiles.  By the summer of 1930  the Bombay mill owners were ",
  "left with  record unsold stocks-120,000  bales of cloth  and  19,000 ",
  "bales of yam.97 Throwing  their lot with the Congress now seemed to ",
  "be an option  worth  trying. Congress too began to support  many of ",
  "their  demands  and made them  into  national  issues,  and thus began ",
  "to attract  the capitalist  class to its side.  But the problem  was,  there ",
  "had  also  been  a parallel  expansion  of the  industrial  working  class ",
  "and  a rise in its  political consciousness.  The year  1928-29  was the ",
  "peak period  of labour unrest in India, wimessing about 203 strikes ",
  "spread  over  all  parts  of the  country.  Although  the  workers  often ",
  "exhibited  considerable  autonomy  of action,  one of the major  rea\u00ad",
  "sons behind  this enhanced  labour  activism  was the  penetration  of ",
  "communist influence-in  eastern  India through  the Workers' Peas\u00ad",
  "ants'  Party  and  in  Bombay  through  the  Gimi  Kamgar  Union.  By ",
  "1930,  however,  this  communist  influence  declined  as the  govern\u00ad",
  "ment came down heavily on them with repressive measures, and the ",
  "Comintem  instructed  them  to keep distance from the Congress-led ",
  "nationalist movement  This gave the Congress an opportunity  to res\u00ad",
  "urrect a broad  united  front, although  working-class  support for it ",
  "was in general weak, except  in Bengal,  where their fight was against ",
  "the British capitalists. But still the Congress tried to project itself as a ",
  "\"supra-class entity\" and \"above intere  and thus  ought, although ",
  "ts\"gs ",
  "very clumsily, to bring in both  the capitalists and the workers under ",
  "the same banner  (more in chapter 7). ",
  "Within  such  a cluttered context of discord  and  disorder, Indian ",
  "politics  was galvanised  again  from late 1927  when a Tory govern\u00ad",
  "ment  in  London  appointed  an  all-white  Statutory  Commission ",
  "under  Sir John  Simon to review  the operation  of the constitutional ",
  "system  in  India. Non-inclusion  of Indians  in the  commission  pro\u00ad",
  "voked protests from all the political groups in India and resulted in a ",
  "successful  nationwide  boycott-participated  by both  Congress and ",
  "the  Muslim  League.  When  the  Simon  Commission arrived  in the ",
  "country in  early 1928,  it  was greeted with  slogans  like \"Go  Back ",
  "Simon\".  Morilal Nehru  in this context started negotiating  for a joint ",
  "Hindu-Muslim  constitutional  scheme as a fitting reply, and at an all ",
  "parties  conference  in Lucknow  in August  1928  the Nehru  Report ",
  "was finalised.  It was a bunch  of uneasy compromises  and therefore ",
  "stood on shaky grounds. Its final fate was to be decided at the forth\u00ad",
  "coming  Calcutta Congress  in December  1928,  and Morilal wanted ",
  "Gandhi  to  throw  his  weight  behind  the  scheme,  so  that  it  was ",
  "accepted  smoothly by the Congress. But for Gandhi swaraj was not a https://telegram.me/UPSCMaterials https://telegram.me/FreeUPSCMaterials https://telegram.me/MaterialforExam",

  "FROM PLASSEY TO PARTIIION ",
  "opposition to the Nehru Report had become stronger.  It contained a ",
  "constitutional  scheme  that  proposed  dominion  status  for  India, ",
  "which  was opposed by  a radical younger  group  led  by jawaharlal ",
  "Nehru  and  Subhas Chandra  Bose. Both Nehru  and  Bose were  in ",
  "favour of complete  independence.  Even Muslim opposition  to the ",
  "report  was  increasing,  as groups headed  by Jinnah  and  Aga Khan ",
  "repudiated  it.  So Gandhi proposed a compromise resolution, which ",
  "adopted  the Nehru  Report, but said that if the government  did not ",
  "accept it by 31 December 1930, the Congress would go in for a non\u00ad",
  "cooperation  movement  to  achieve  full independence.  Jawaharlal ",
  "Nehru  and Su  bhas Bose were still unhappy; but when Gandhi  as a ",
  "further  concession cut down  the time limit to 1929,  the  resolution ",
  "was passed.  In the open session  also Gandhi's compromise resolu\u00ad",
  "tion  was  carried,  while  Bose's  amendment  demanding  complete ",
  "independence was lost. Thus Gandhi  once again came to dominate ",
  "the Congress, but as Brown (1977)  says, he wanted to assume lead\u00ad",
  "ership only on his own terms. So he had a second  resolution  passed ",
  "which  contained  a  detailed  programme  of constructive  work.  It ",
  "involved  revival of organisational  work, removal of untouchabiliry, ",
  "boycott of foreign cloth,  spread ofkhadi,  temperance,  village recon\u00ad",
  "struction  and removal  of disabilities  of women.  It was through this ",
  "constructive  programme that Gandhi hoped  to achieve true swaraj. ",
  "But one  important  issue  that this  constructive  programme  did not ",
  "touch was Hindu-Muslim  unity. ",
  "Even after the Calcutta Congress, some Congress leaders  outside ",
  "the Nehru-Bose  group, like  the Liberals,  preferred  cooperation  with ",
  "the British.  The  then viceroy,  Lord Irwin, also  wanted  a reconcilia\u00ad",
  "tion to introduce  a constitutional  scheme  with a dominion  status as ",
  "the  ultimate goal.  He received  the support  of the  Labour  govern\u00ad",
  "ment  in  power  and  hence  came  the  \"Irwin  Offer\"  of 31  October ",
  "1929, proposing a Round Table Conference  to settle the issue. Gan\u00ad",
  "dhi  was reluctant to reject it outright,  but negotiations  broke  down, ",
  "as the Congress leaders wanted the details of the dominion  status to ",
  "be discussed,  and not just  the principle.  In December  public atten\u00ad",
  "tion shifted  to Lahore  where  the next  session  of the Congress was ",
  "going to be held withjawaharlal  Nehru as the president. Many lead\u00ad",
  "ers had  reservations  about  starting  a movement  for  full independ\u00ad",
  "ence, particularly in view of the rising wave of violence spearheaded ",
  "by revolutionary leaders like Bhagat Singh and others.  So when Gan\u00ad",

  "encounter;  but  in spite  of everything  his preferred  resolution  was ",

  "immediately. The All India Congress Committee  (AICC) was author\u00ad",
  "ised to start  a civil disobedience  movement  at an appropriate  time. ",
  "But Gandhi,  as it seems, had not as yet been able to convince all his ",
  "cnncs. ",
  "The  call  for  the  boycott  of  legislatures  evoked  only  limited ",
  "response.  Muslim  members  of the  Congress,  like Dr Ansari,  were ",
  "unhappy,  as communal  unity they thought  was an essential precon\u00ad",
  "dition  for the success of a civil disobedience  movement. Outside the ",
  "Congress,  the  Muslim  Conference  and  the  Muslim  League  con\u00ad",
  "demned  the movement as a devise to establish Hindu  Raj. Similarly, ",
  "Sikh support  also seemed to have shifted away from Congress. Non\u00ad",
  "Congress Hindus, like the Hindu Mahasabha and the Justice Party in ",
  "Madras  declared  their  opposition  to  civil  disobedience.  Business ",
  "groups  were  apprehensive  about  the  uncertain  possibilities  of  the ",
  "Lahore  resolution,  while  young  Congressmen  were  pressing  for ",
  "more  militant  action.  Under  the circumstances,  the  celebration  of ",
  "the \"Independence  Day\" on 26 January  1930 evoked little enthusi\u00ad",
  "asm, except in Punjab, UP, Delhi and Bombay. In Bihar, the celebra\u00ad",
  "tions resulted in violent clashes between the police and the Congress ",
  "volunteers.  Gandhi  had  to  devise  a strategy  to  break  out  of  this ",
  "impasse and  impute  a broader  meaning  into  the  word  'independ\u00ad",
  "ence', as opposed to its narrower  political connotation  that had such ",
  "a divisive impact. ",
  "On 31 January 1930   Gandhi therefore  announced  an eleven point ",
  "ultimatum  for Lord Irwin; if these demands were met by 11 March, ",
  "he declared,  there would  be no civil disobedience  and the Congress ",
  "would participate  in any conference.  It was a compromise  formula, ",
  "which  included,  according  to  Surnit  Sarkar's  classification,  six ",
  "\"issues of general  interest\",  like reduction  of military  expenditure ",
  "and  civil  service  salaries,  total  prohibition,  discharge  of  political ",
  "prisoners  not convicted of murder,  reform  of the CID and its popu\u00ad",
  "lar control  and changes  in the  arms  act;  three  \"specific  bourgeois ",
  "demands\",  like lowering  of the  rupee-sterling  exchange  rate  to  I s ",
  "4d, protective  tariff on foreign cloth and reservation  of coastal traf\u00ad",
  "fic  for  Indian  shipping  companies;  and  two  \"basically  peasant ",
  "themes\",  i.e.,  50 per cent reduction  of land revenue and its subjec\u00ad",
  "tion to legislative control  and abolition  of salt tax and government ",

  "political elements,  nor would  provoke  government  repression.  And ",
  "finally, it could be made into a highly emotive issue with great pub\u00ad",
  "licity value. ",
  "Irwin was in no  mood  to compromise,  and hence  on  12 March ",
  "began Gandhi's  historic Dandi March to the Gujarat seashore where ",
  "on  6 April  he publicly violated  the  salt  law.  The  march  attracted ",
  "enormous  publicity both in India and overseas, and was followed  by ",
  "wholesale illegal manufacture  and sale of salt, accompanied  by boy\u00ad",
  "cott of foreign cloth and liquor. In the next stage would come non\u00ad",
  "payment of revenue in the ryotwari areas, non-payment of chaukidari ",
  "taxes in the zamindari  areas and violation  of forest laws in the Cen\u00ad",

  "out a programme,  which would  have less divisive impact on Indian ",
  "society. But things began to take an abrupt  tum  towards  the end of ",
  "April, as violent terrorist  activities and less disciplined  mass upsurge ",
  "began to take place in different  parts of India. The most important ",
  "of these was the armoury raid in Chittagong  in Bengal, followed by a ",
  "spate of terrorist  activities throughout  the province.  In Peshawar the ",
  "masses became unruly after the arrest of the local charismatic  leader ",
  "Badsha Khan. Then  in mid-May  Gandhi  himself was arrested.  This ",
  "was followed by a spontaneous  textile strike in Sholapur, where  the ",
  "workers  went  around  rampaging  government  buildings  and  other ",
  "official targets in the city. All these encouraged  in nearly all parts of ",
  "India a mass movement  that did not merely involve non-cooperation ",
  "with a foreign government,  but actual violation of its laws to achieve ",
  "complete  independence.  Even  the  outbreak  of  violence  in  three ",
  "areas did not  immediately  lead to withdrawal  of the movement.  In ",
  "this sense, the Civil Disobedience movement,  as S umit Sarkar ( 198 3) ",
  "has argued, witnessed a definite advance of radicalism over the 1920 ",
  "movement.  But at the same time,  it was not  an unqualified  success. ",
  "There  was a discernible absence of Hindu-Muslim  unity, no major ",
  "labour  participation  and the intelligentsia  was not as involved  as in ",
  "the past. ",
  "On the other hand, a new feature of the Civil Disobedience  move\u00ad",
  "ment was a massive business support.  They participated,  at least dur\u00ad",
  "ing the  initial period,  in two very fruitful  ways:  they  provided  the ",

  "and  Benoy,  Badal  and  Dinesh  in  Bengal,  who  had  attacked  the ",
  "Writers'  Building  in Calcutta,  became  their  heroes.  On  the  other ",
  "hand, working-class support was non-existent  and given their recent ",
  "radical propensities,  Gandhi had reservations  about  involving them ",
  "in the movement.  One exception  was Nagpur,  where working-class ",
  "participation  was massive and much  more  than  in the  1921  move\u00ad",

  "ment.! '  In the countryside,  the enthusiasm  of the richer peasantry, ",
  "such as the Patidars  of Gujarat  or the Jats of UP, dissipated  due to ",
  "confiscation and sale of properties.  On the other hand,  drastic fall in ",
  "agricultural  prices resulted  in the movement  of the lesser peasantry ",
  "acquiring radical tendencies, such as no-rent  campaigns in UP, viola\u00ad",
  "tion  of  forest  laws  and  tribal  rebellions  in  parts  of Andhra,  CP, ",
  "Maharashtra,  Orissa, Bihar, Assam and Punjab. These developments ",
  "might  have serious  divisive impact  on  society  which  Gandhi  cer\u00ad",
  "tainly wanted  to avoid.  So the  movement  was withdrawn  through ",
  "the Gandhi-Irwin  Pact of 5 March  1931 and Congress agreed to par\u00ad",
  "ticipate in the Second Round Table Conference  to discuss the future ",
  "constitution  of India. Interestingly, peasants in Orissa celebrated  the ",
  "truce as a \"victory for Gandhi\"  and were further  encouraged  to stop ",
  "paying taxes and manufacture  salt! !01 ",
  "The  compromise  of  1931  is,  however,  the  subject  of  a  major ",
  "controversy  in Indian  history. It was  Moore  (1974)  who  first ",
  "R.J. ",
  "pointed  out  that  bourgeois  pressure was a significant factor behind ",
  "the compromise,  a point which Sumit Sarkar (1976) developed  later ",
  "to argue that the Indian bourgeoisie  played a \"crucial\"  role both  in ",
  "the initial success of the movement as well as in its subsequent with\u00ad",
  "drawal.  This  position  has  been  accepted  by  other  historians  too ",
  "across the ideological spectrum,  like Judith  Brown  (1977),  Claude ",
  "Markovits  (1985)  and  Basudev  Chatterji  (1992).  The  alliance ",
  "between  Congress  and the capitalists,  it is argued,  was uneasy and ",
  "vulnerable  from  the  very  beginning  and  now  uncontrolled  mass ",
  "movement unnerved the business classes who wanted  to give peace a ",
  "chance.  Hence  the pressure  on  Gandhi  to return  to constitutional ",
  "politics and the result was the Gandhi-Irwin  Pact. But the problem ",
  "with  this  thesis  is that  the  business  groups  hardly  represented  a ",
  "homogeneous  class in  1931 and  did  not  speak with  one voice. As ",
  "A.D.D. Gordon  puts  it,  the  enthusiasm  of  the  industrialists  was ",
  "dampened  by the depression,  boycott,  hartals and the social disrup\u00ad",
  "tions, and they wanted either to destroy civil disobedience  or broker ",
  "a peace  between  Congress  and  the  government.  But on  the  other https://telegram.me/UPSCMaterials https://telegram.me/FreeUPSCMaterials https://telegram.me/MaterialforExam",

  "side  by side with  this apathy and antipathy,  there were also signs of ",
  "more  radicalism  among  certain  other  sections  of the  lower  peas\u00ad",
  "antry, expressed  through  salt satyagrahas,  forest  saryagrahas,  non\u00ad",
  "payment  of chaukidari  taxes,  no-rent  and  no-revenue  campaigns. ",
  "But these  were  movements  largely outside  the ambit  of Congress ",
  "organisation,  and so at places Congress leaders tried to exert a mod\u00ad",
  "erating influence on them, or where this was not possible, sought to ",
  "distance themselves from such peasant  militancy .112 ",
  "In the urban areas, the business groups were certainly ambivalent. ",
  "There  was  an  open  estrangement  between  the  Congress  and  the ",
  "Bombay  mill-owners,  who  under  the  leadership  of Homi  Mody ",
  "warned  Gandhi against a renewal of the movement.  The other sec\u00ad",
  "tions of the Indian  big business were in a dilemma.  Their  hope for ",
  "concessions  from the government  had been belied; but a renewal of ",
  "civil disobedience  might this time seriously threaten  the social status ",
  "quo,  as government  was  more  prepared  for  a  counter  offensive. ",
  "Under the strain  of this dilemma, argues Claude Markovits  (1985), ",
  "the unity  of the  Indian capitalist  class broke  down.  By  1933,  the ",
  "weakening  economy  and growing  violence even crushed  the enthu\u00ad",
  "siasm of the staunchest  of Gandhian  supporters-the  Gujarati  and ",
  "Marwari  merchants.!'? The urban intelligentsia also felt less inclined ",
  "to  follow  the  Gandhian  path.  Picketing  of shops  was  frequently ",
  "punctuated  by the  use of bombs,  which  Gandhi  condemned,  but ",
  "failed to stop. The labour remained  apathetic and the Muslims often ",
  "antagonistic.  Government  repression  saw  thousands  of Congress ",
  "volunteers behind bars. The movement gradually declined by 1934. ",
  "For Congress, however, the Civil Disobedience movement  was by ",
  "no means a failure.  It had by now mobilised great  political  support ",
  "and gained a moral authority,  which were converted  into a massive ",
  "electoral  victory  in  1937.  In this  first election  under  the  Govern\u00ad",
  "ment of India Act of 1935, which offered  franchise to a larger elec\u00ad",
  "torate,  Congress  achieved  absolute  majority  in  five out  of  eleven ",
  "provinces, i.e., Madras,  Bihar, Orissa, C.P. and U.P.,near majority in ",
  "Bombay and  became  the single largest party  in Bengal, which  was ",
  "a  Muslim  majority  province.  For  most  of the  Indians,  especially ",
  "Hindus,  it was a \"vote for Gandhiji and the yellow box\",  and it re\u00ad",
  "gistered  their  expectation  for  some  real  socio-economic  changes, ",

  "6.5.  THE  ACT OF  1935,  \"PAPER  FEDERATION\" ",
  "AND  THE  PRINCES ",
  "The Act of 1919 had impressed neither any section of Indian  opin\u00ad",
  "ion, nor the Conservatives in London. The political agitations  made ",
  "it clear that Congress had to be allowed some share of power, with\u00ad",
  "out  endangering  British control  over  the  central  government.  So ",
  "fresh discussions for reform started in the late 1920s, with a parlia\u00ad",
  "mentary  commission  appointed  in  1927  under  Lord  Simon.  But ",
  "when the  Simon Commission  visited India, it was boycotted  by all ",
  "the political  parties as it was wholly European  and did not include ",
  "any Indian  member.  In October  1929,  Lord  Irwin made a further ",
  "concession  by making an announcement  that full dominion  status ",
  "would  be the natural  goal of India's  constitutional  progress;  but in ",
  "view of Conservative  opposition  at home,  it meant  really nothing. ",
  "The report of the Simon Commission was released in June 1930 and ",
  "it suggested the  replacement  of dyarchy with  full responsible  gov\u00ad",
  "ernment  in the  provinces,  with  the  provision  of some  emergency ",
  "powers in the hands of the governors;  but no change was suggested ",
  "in  the  constitution  of  the  central  government.  Meant  to  protect ",
  "imperial control  over the centre,  the proposal  satisfied none of the ",
  "political groups  in India and could not  be implemented  because of ",
  "the beginning of Civil Disobedience movement.  Irwin again offered ",
  "as a concession the proposal  of a Round Table Conference  to discuss ",
  "the  future  system of government.  But its first session, held in Lon\u00ad",
  "don between November  1930 and January  1931, was boycotted  by ",
  "the  Congress. Here  the nominated  representatives  of British India ",
  "and princely  states discussed the need for a federal government  of ",
  "India free of British control.  But the conference achieved very little, ",
  "as the  Conservative-dominated  National  government  in power  in ",
  "London was not in a mood to take the federal idea seriously. Gandhi ",
  "was then persuaded  to participate  in the Second Round Table Con\u00ad",
  "ference  in September-December 1931 on  the  basis of three  vague ",
  "principles  of  federation,  responsible  government  and  reservation ",
  "and safeguards. But Gandhi's participation  proved futile, as negotia\u00ad",
  "tions  at  the  Minorities  Committee  broke  down  on  the  issue  of https://telegram.me/UPSCMaterials https://telegram.me/FreeUPSCMaterials https://telegram.me/MaterialforExam",

  "separate electorate,  now demanded not only by the Muslims, but by ",
  "the  depressed classes (untouchables),  Anglo-Indians,  Indian  Chris\u00ad",
  "tians and the Europeans too. With the coming of a Tory ministry in ",
  "Britain in  September  1931, British  official attitudes  hardened  even ",
  "further.116 ",
  "The  constitutional  history  of India  again  took a dramatic  turn ",
  "when Prime Minister Ramsay Macdonald announced  his Communal ",
  "Award in August  1932. It apportioned  representation  among com\u00ad",
  "munities  and  extended  the provision  of separate  electorate  to  the ",
  "untouchables  as well. Gandhi, then in Yeravdajail, saw in it a sinister ",
  "motive to divide the Hindu society, as the untouchables, he believed, ",
  "were an integral part  of it. The  provision  of separate  electorate,  he ",
  "argued,  would  politically  separate  them  and  would  permanently ",
  "block the path of their integration  into Hindu society. He therefore ",
  "decided  to  fast unto  death  to reverse the arrangement.  The  nation ",
  "panicked,  although some of the depressed classes leaders  like M. C. ",
  "Rajah  favoured  joint  electorate,  the  most  influential  of them,  Dr ",
  "B.R. Ambedkar saw in the provision of separate  electorate  the only ",
  "hope  of securing political representation  for the untouchables  (for ",
  "more details see chapter 7.2).  But Gandhi,  though  opposed to sepa\u00ad",
  "rate  electorate,  was not  averse  to  the  idea  of  reserved  seats,  and ",
  "Ambedkar  too  ultimately  agreed  to it,  as the  proposed number  of ",
  "such  reserved  seats  for  the  depressed  classes was increased  and  a ",
  "two-tier  election  system was recommended  to ensure proper  repre\u00ad",
  "sentation  of such classes. 117 This became the basis of the Poona Pact ",
  "of September  1932, which the government  subsequently  accepted. ",
  "The  third  Round Table Conference  in November-December  1932 ",
  "was largely formal and unimportant,  as only 46 out of 112  delegates ",
  "attended  the session. A White Paper in March  1933 set up a Parlia\u00ad",
  "mentary Joint  Select Committee  with a provision merely to consult ",
  "Indian opinion.  The Government  of India Act, which ultimately did ",
  "eventuate  in  1935 could therefore  hardly  satisfy anybody  and  was ",
  "criticised equally by Congress as well as the Muslim League. ",
  "In the provinces, in place of dyarchy the Act of 1935   provided  for ",
  "responsible  government  in  all the  departments.  But  this  was bal\u00ad",
  "anced off by wide discretionary powers given to the governors about ",
  "summoning  legislatures,  giving  assent  to  bills  and  administering ",
  "tribal regions. The governors were also given special power to safe\u00ad",
  "guard minority rights, privileges of civil servants and British business ",
  "interests.  And finally, they could take over and run the administra\u00ad",

  "into effect only if more than  50 per cent of the princely states for\u00ad",
  "mally acceded to it by signing the Instruments  of Accession, which ",
  "would  override  their  previous  treaties  with  the British crown The ",
  "act introduced  dyarchy  at  the  centre,  but  subject  to  various  safe\u00ad",
  "guards,  and  departments  like foreign  affairs, defence  and  internal ",
  "security  remained  completely  under  the  control  of  the  viceroy. ",
  "Another feature of this act was the transfer of financial control  from ",
  "London  to New  Delhi,  in response  to  a long-standing  demand  of ",
  "the  Government  of India  for  fiscal autonomy.  The  electorate  was ",
  "enlarged  to  30  million;  but  the  high  property  qualifications  only ",
  "enfranchised  10 per cent of the Indian population.  In rural India, it ",
  "gave voting right to the rich and middle  peasants,  as they were pre\u00ad",
  "sumably the main constituency  for Congress politics. So the act, sus\u00ad",
  "pects  D.A. Low,  was  a  ploy  to  corrode  the  support  base  of  the ",
  "Congress and tie these important  classes to the Raj. A \"competition ",
  "for the allegiance of the dominant  peasant communities\",  he writes, ",
  "lay at the heart of the conflict between  the Congress and the  at ",
  "Raj ",
  "this  stage. 118  Apart  from  that,  in the  bicameral  central  legislature, ",
  "members  nominated  by the princes would  constitute  30  to 40 per ",
  "cent of the seats, thus permanently  eliminating  the  possibility of a ",
  "Congress  majority.  Separate  electorate  was provided  for the  Mus\u00ad",
  "lims and reserved seats for the Scheduled Castes (a new term for the ",
  "'depressed  classes'  or  untouchables)  in  the  provincial  and  central ",
  "legislatures. Not unjustifiably the Labour opposition  argued in Lon\u00ad",
  "don that the act only proposed to protect British interests in India by ",
  "sharing power with the loyalist elements. ",
  "The Act of 1935   did not mention the granting of dominion  status ",
  "promised  during the Civil Disobedience  movement.  However  much ",
  "diehard  Conservatives  like Winston  Churchill  might think  that the ",
  "act amounted  to Britain's  abdication  of empire,  his colleagues  had ",
  "consciously chosen the federal structure  because, as Carl Bridge has ",
  "argued,  it \"would  act primarily  to protect  Britain's  interests  rather ",
  "than hand over control  in vital areas\" .119  Its net effect was to divert ",
  "Congress  attention  to  the  provinces,  while  maintaining  strong ",
  "imperial  control  at  the  centre.  If any  change  happened  at  all,  as ",
  "B.R.  Tomlinson  has pointed  out  \"The apex  of the system of impe\u00ad",

  "thought  it the best way ...  to hold India to the Empire. \"121 ",
  "The provincial part of the 193 5 act took effect with the elections ",
  "of 193 7;  but a stalemate prevailed at the centre, perhaps as expected ",
  "by the Tories, because the federal  part of the  act remained  a non\u00ad",
  "starter,  as no one seemed to be really interested  in it. The Muslim ",
  "leaders,  first of all, were afraid of Hindu  domination  and  felt that ",
  "the  proposed  federal structure  was still very unitary. All the repre\u00ad",
  "sentatives of British India to the central legislature were to be elected ",
  "by the provincial assemblies and this would go against the Muslims ",
  "who were minorities  in all but four provinces.  So although  they did ",
  "not oppose federation  in public, they certainly preferred  decentrali\u00ad",
  "sation,  with  a weak central  government,  allowing  more autonomy ",
  "for the provincial governments in the Muslim majority provinces.122 ",
  "The Congress too did not like the proposed  structure  of the federa\u00ad",
  "tion, where one-third  of the seats in the federal assembly were to be ",
  "filled in by the princes, thus tying up the fate of democratic  India to ",
  "the  whims of the  autocratic  dynastic  rulers. 123  But the  federation ",
  "scheme  ultimately  failed  because the princes  were reluctant  to join ",
  "it. Their  main objection was that the act did not resolve the issue of ",
  "pararnountcy.  The Government  of India as a paramount  power still ",
  "enjoyed  the right  to intervene  in the  affairs of their  states or even ",
  "overthrow  them  if necessary. Their  other fear was about  joining  a ",
  "democratised federal central  government,  where  the elected  politi\u00ad",
  "cal leaders of British India would have little sympathy for their auto\u00ad",
  "cratic  rules  and  would  provide  encouragement  to  the  democratic ",
  "movements  in their  territories. Furthermore,  the  larger  states  did ",
  "not want to surrender  their fiscal autonomy, while the smaller states ",
  "complained  of their  inadequate  representation  in the legislarure.P' ",
  "However, these concerns of the princes would become more mean\u00ad",
  "ingful if placed in their proper  historical  context. It will, therefore, ",
  "be pertinent  here to digress a little to tell the story of princely India ",
  "since the outbreak  of World War One. ",
  "If the Curzonian policy of interventionist  paternalism  had strained ",
  "the  relationship  between  the  princes  and  the Raj at the  beginning ",
  "of the twentieth century, Minta's policy of laissez faire again revived ",
  "the bonhomie.  The latter policy was intended to insulate  the states ",

  "deposed due to alleged charges of financial irregularities,  the combi\u00ad",
  "nation  of Congress, Arya Samaj  and the J at Mahasabha made  this ",
  "region a major centre  of nationalism  in the entire  Rajasthan. 129  But, ",

  "ism became powerful in the first decade of the twentieth century and ",
  "later  when  the Non-cooperation  movement  rocked  the  subconti\u00ad",
  "nent,  the princes rendered  valuable service in containing  the ride in ",
  "their  territories.  The  visit  of the  Prince of Wales, boycotted  by the ",
  "Congress,  was made somewhat  worthwhile  because of the warmth ",
  "and grandeur  of princely  welcome.  In the 1920s, however,  popular ",
  "movements  began to appear  in all these states  in the  form of ",
  "parja ",
  "mandals.  These  mandals  were  eventually  affiliated  to  a  national ",
  "body  called  the All  India  States'  People's  Conference,  founded in ",
  "1927  with its headquarters  at Bombay.  It raised moderate demands ",
  "for  democratic  rights  and constitutional  changes,  to which  many  of ",
  "the princes responded  with sharp vengeance and massive repression. ",
  "However, if most of them were sensitive about guarding their auton\u00ad",

  "interference in the affairs of the states-ostensibly, out of respect for ",
  "the  princes'  traditional  rights  of  sovereignty.  The  only  exception ",
  "was made in  1928  when a Congress resolution  urged  the princes to ",
  "\"introduce  responsible government based  on representative institu\u00ad",

  "tional status. But the Indian States Committee,  which was formed in ",
  "1928  under  Sir Harcourt  Butler,  scarcely  provided  in  its Report ",
  "(1929)  any solace for the beleaguered  princes.  It gave them  a con\u00ad",
  "cession  in the  form  of a promise  that  paramountcy  would  not be ",
  "transferred  without  their consent to any democratically  elected gov\u00ad",
  "ernment  in  British  India;  but  at  the  same  time,  it  reaffirmed  the ",
  "supremacy  of paramountcy  with  unlimited  power-even  to suggest ",
  "constitutional  changes  in  a  particular  state  if  there  was  wides\u00ad",
  "pread  demand  for such  reforms.  It did push  the  doctrine  of para\u00ad",
  "mountcy,  a  Political  Department  officer  confessed,  \"beyond  any ",
  "hitherto  accepted  limit\". us ",
  "Thus pushed to a tight corner and pressured  from both ends, the ",
  "princes now started taking interest in politics and began to fraternise ",
  "with  some of the  moderate  politicians.  They  found  in the  idea of ",
  "federation,  first proposed  in the Motilal Nehru  Report of 1928,  an ",
  "ideal way out  of their  present  predicament.  By joining an autono\u00ad",
  "mous all-India  federation  they could escape  the  \"shackles  of para\u00ad",
  "mountcy\"  and  at  the  same  time  could  safeguard  their  internal ",
  "autonomy  of action. But not all princes were too  sure about  it, the ",
  "Maharaja  of Pariala being  the  leader  of this  faction.  Ultimately  a ",
  "mutual  agreement-known  as the  \"Delhi  Pact\"-was brokered  on ",
  "11 March  and was endorsed by the Chamber  of Princes  on  1  April ",
  "1932, projecting  federation  as a constitutional  demand  of the prin\u00ad",
  "ces of India.  But the  demand  was cushioned,  as Ian  Copland  has ",
  "pointed  out,  with  significant  safeguards,  which  were  sure  to  be ",
  "rejected by both  the British and the nationalists.  They wanted,  for ",
  "example,  individual  seats for  all the  members  of  the Chamber  of ",
  "Princes in the upper house of the federal legislature,  protection  of ",
  "their existing  treaty  rights, subjects to be placed under  the jurisdic\u00ad",
  "tion of the federal government  were to be mutually agreed upon  by ",
  "the  member  states, and  above all,  a right  to secede.Ps The  British ",
  "loved the idea of federation, as in that case the princes could act as https://telegram.me/UPSCMaterials https://telegram.me/FreeUPSCMaterials https://telegram.me/MaterialforExam",
  "330 ",
  "FROM PLASSEY TO PARTIDON ",
  "counterweight  against the nationalist  politicians from the provinces; ",
  "but their idea of federation  differed from that of the princes.  If in the ",
  "first Round  Table  Conference  the representatives  of princely  India ",
  "deliberated  enthusiastically on a federation,  by the time of its second ",
  "session many of them had developed cold feet about the idea. At its ",
  "Bombay session in late January  1935,  the Chamber  adopted  a reso\u00ad",
  "lution,  which was highly critical of the federation  proposal  as it had ",
  "evolved by that time. When finally the Government  of India Act got ",
  "the royal assent on 2 August 1935, the federation  scheme contained ",
  "in it could hardly satisfy the majority of the princes.!\" ",
  "However,  Ian Copland  (1999) argues that the princes even at this ",
  "stage were not completely rejecting federation,  but were bargaining ",
  "for a better  deal.  They wanted  the  Instrument  of Accession to be ",
  "defined appropriately  to address their two major concerns,  i.e., rec\u00ad",
  "ognition  of their existing treaty rights and protection  of their inter\u00ad",
  "nal autonomy. Although the new viceroy, Linlithgow, recommended ",
  "some such changes, intense  bureaucratic  haggling delayed  the  pro\u00ad",
  "cess by several years. In the meanwhile, the spectacular  political rise ",
  "of the  Congress  after  the  provincial  elections  of 1937 made  the ",
  "princes  panicky. In  1938  the  traditional  Congress  policy  of non\u00ad",
  "interference in the affairs of the states was jettisoned at the Haripura ",
  "Congress, and in the following months the most vehement  peoples' ",
  "movement  under  the  leadership  of  the  All India  States'  People's ",
  "Conference,  with the active patronage  of the Congress, rocked prin\u00ad",
  "cely India (for more details of this movement see chapter  8.1 ). The ",
  "smaller and middle-sized states were hardly prepared  for this kind of ",
  "popular  upsurge  and  they  buckled  in,  taking  a  more  conciliatory ",
  "attitude  towards the Congress. But the larger states fought back with ",
  "resolute  stubbornness,  and they were  helped  by British troops.  To ",
  "the majority ofthe princes in 1939, the Congress had thus shown its ",
  "true  colours  and  could  therefore  never be trusted  again. When  in ",
  "January  1939  Linlithgow  finally  gave them  a  revised  offer,  with ",
  "some minor concessions, federation  to most of them had become an ",
  "unmitigated  evil to  be rejected  outright.  That is what  they  did  at ",
  "the  Bombay session of the  Chamber  of Princes in June;  and  then, ",
  "when the war broke out in Europe  in August, the secretary  of state, ",
  "Zetland,  promptly  put the federal offer in \"cold storage\" .138 ",
