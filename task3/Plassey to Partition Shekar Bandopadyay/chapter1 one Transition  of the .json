  "Eighteenth  Century ",
  "1.1.  DECLINE OF THE MUGHAL  EMPIRE ",
  "Founded  by Zahiruddin  Babur  in  1526  and  expanded  to  its  full ",
  "glory by Emperor  Akbar in the second half of the sixteenth  century, ",
  "the Mughal empire began to decline rapidly since the reign of its last ",
  "great ruler Aurangzeb (i658-1707).  Even in the first half of the sev\u00ad",
  "enteenth  century  its capital Delhi  was considered  to  be the  major ",
  "power centre in the entire eastern hemisphere;  but within  fifty years ",
  "the signs of decline of this mighty empire were unmistakably visible. ",
  "Some  historians ascribe Aurangzeb's  divisive policies for this rapid ",
  "decline-\u00ab particularly blamed are his religious policies, which  alien\u00ad",
  "ated the Hindus who constituted  the majority of the subject popula\u00ad",
  "tion. His expansionist  military  campaigns  in western  India  against ",
  "the two autonomous  states of Bijapur  and Golconda and against the ",
  "Marathas  are also believed to have sapped the vitality ofthe empire. ",
  "But some other historians  believe  that the roots of Mughal  decline ",
  "lay in institutions  and  systems intrinsic  to Mughal  administration, ",
  "rather than in personalities or specific policies. ",
  "There  is, however, less dispute about the fact that the process of ",
  "decline had set in during the time ofA  urangzeb and that it could not ",
  "be arrested  by his weak successors. The situation  was further  wors\u00ad",
  "ened  by  recurrent  wars of succession. The Mughal army  was weak\u00ad",
  "ened, allegedly because of a lamentable dearth of able commanders; ",
  "there was no military reform  and no new technology. This weaken\u00ad",
  "ing  of the  Mughal  military  power  encouraged  internal  rebellions ",
  "and invited foreign invasions.  The Marathas under Shivaji had time ",
  "and again challenged Aurangzeb's  imperial rule. After his death  the ",
  "Maratha  plunders  increased-in 1738 they plundered  even the sub\u00ad",
  "urbs  of Delhi.  This  was  followed  by the  Persian  invasion  under ",
  "Nadir Shah in 1738-3\ufffd and the sack of Delhi, which was a tremen\u00ad",
  "dous blow to the prestige of the empire. A brief recovery followed ",
  "and the first Afghan invasion in  174  8 was repelled. But the Afghans https://telegram.me/UPSCMaterials https://telegram.me/FreeUPSCMaterials https://telegram.me/MaterialforExam",
  "2  FROM  PLASSEY TO PARTITION ",
  "under Ahmad Shah Abdali again struck back, took over Punjab and ",
  "sacked Delhi in 1756-57.  To repel the Afghans, the Mughals sought ",
  "help from the Marathas; but the latter were also defeated by Abdali ",
  "at  the  battle of Panipat  in  1761. The Afghan menace  did  not last ",
  "long, because a revolt in the army forced Abdali to retire to Afghani\u00ad",
  "stan. But the political situation  in north India certainly signified  the ",
  "passing of the glorious days ofMughal  empire. ",
  "Earlier historians  like Sir J.N.  Sarkar  (1932-50) believed  that it ",
  "was a crisis of personality-weak emperors  and  incompetent com\u00ad",
  "manders were responsible for this downfall  of the  mighty Mughal ",
  "empire.  But  then,  other historians  like T.G.P.  Spear  (1973)  have ",
  "pointed  out  that there was no dearth of able personalities in eigh\u00ad",
  "teenth-century  India. It was indeed a period  marked  by the activities ",
  "of such able politicians  and generals as the Sayyid brothers, Nizarn\u00ad",
  "ul-Mulk,  Abdus Samad  Khan,  Zakaria  Khan,  Saadat  Khan,  Safdar ",
  "Jung, Murshid  Quli Khan or Sawai j ai Singh.  But unfortunately, all ",
  "these able statesmen were preoccupied  more in self-aggrandisement ",
  "and had little concern for the fate of the empire. So at times of crises, ",
  "they could not provide leadership  and even directly contributed to ",
  "the process of decline. But this need not be considered as personal ",
  "failures, as it was more due to the weaknesses inherent in the Mughal ",
  "institutions,  which had evolved gradually in the sixteenth and seven\u00ad",
  "teenth centuries. ",
  "The  Mughal  empire  has  been  described  as a  \"war-state\"  in  its ",
  "core.1  It sought to develop a centralised administrative system, whose ",
  "vitality  depended  ultimately  on  its military  power.  The  emperor ",
  "stood at the apex of this structure, his authority  resting  primarily on ",
  "his military  might.  Below  him  the other most important element  in ",
  "this structure was the military aristocracy. In the late sixteenth  cen\u00ad",
  "tury, Akbar had organised  this aristocracy  through his ",
  "mansabdari ",
  "system,  which  meant a military organisation of the aristocracy, its ",
  "basis primarily being personal loyalty to the emperor.  Every aristo\u00ad",
  "crat was called  a  with a dual  numerical  and ",
  "mansabdar,  rank-jat ",
  "signifying his  personal  rank  and  sawar the  number  of ",
  "sawar-jat ",
  "horsemen  he  was required  to  maintain.  This dual numerical rank ",
  "also indicated  the position  of a particular nobleman  in the overall ",
  "Mughal  bureaucracy. Sometimes  they  were  paid  in  cash ",
  "(naqdi ",
  "mansabdar);  but most often they were paid in the form of a jagir or ",
  "landed estate, the estimated revenue income  of which would ",
  "{Jama) ",
  "cover  his  personal  salary  and  the  maintenance  allowance  for  his ",
  "soldiers and horses. There were two types of j agir-transferable or ",
  "jagir and  non-transferable  or  jagir. Most of the jagirs ",

  "3 ",
  "TRANSITION  OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY ",
  "were transferable-the  non-transferable  jagirs were only a device to ",
  "incorporate  the  locally  powerful  rajahs  and  zamindars  into  the ",
  "Mughal  system, by proclaiming their autonomous  chiefdoms  their ",
  "vatan jagrrs. ",
  "Appointment,  promotion  or dismissal  of mansabdars and alloca\u00ad",
  "tion or transfer of jagirs were done only by the emperor  and so the ",
  "members of the aristocracy only had personal loyalty to the emperor ",
  "himself Any  form of impersonal  loyalty-national,  ethnic  or reli\u00ad",
  "gious-could not develop in Mughal India and so the entire imperial ",
  "edifice stood on a \"patron-client relationship\"  existing between the ",
  "emperor and the ruling class.2 The effectiveness and the permanence ",
  "of this  relationship  depended  on  the  personal  qualities  of the ",
  "emperor  and the constant  expansion  of resources, which  explains ",
  "the  constant  drive towards territorial  conquests in Mughal  India. ",
  "Buethere were no more conquests since the late years of Aurangzeb, ",
  "and this was supposedly followed by a period of constant shrinkage ",
  "of the resources of the empire. This is what ruptured, as some histo\u00ad",
  "rians  argue, the  functional  relationship  between the emperor  and ",
  "the  aristocracy, on which  depended  the  efficiency of the imperial ",
  "administration. ",
  "To understand  how this  diminishing  loyalty  of the  aristocrats ",
  "could affect the Mughal  empire, a close look at the composition of ",
  "this ruling  class is called  for. Lineage or ethnic background  was the ",
  "single most important factor in matters of appointment  as rnansab\u00ad",
  "dars. A great majority of the Mughal nobles were outsiders who had ",
  "come  from  various  parts  of central  Asia.  But  they were gradually ",
  "Indianised,  although  this  Indianisation  took  place  without  any ",
  "coherent policy of the empire. The aristocracy was therefore divided ",
  "into various ethno-religious groups, the most powerful among them ",
  "being  the Turani and  the Irani groups. Those who came  from  the ",
  "Turkish  speaking regions of central Asia were  called  the  Turanis, ",
  "while those who came from the Persian speaking regions of present\u00ad",
  "day Iran,  Afghanistan and Iraq were called the Iranis. The Turanis ",
  "were Sunnis and the Iranis were Shias, which lent a religious colour ",
  "to their mutual animosity and jealousy.  Though the Mughals belon\u00ad",
  "ged to the Turani ethnic lineage, they did  not show  any  personal ",
  "favour to the Turanis. The other groups among the nobility were the ",
  "Afghans,  Sheikhjadas  or the Indian Muslims and  the Hindus.  The ",
  "latter group  mainly consisted  of the Rajputs and  Marathas, whose ",
  "incorporation  was because of specific political needs  of the empire. ",
  "After Aurangzeb conquered  the two Deccani kingdoms  of Bijapur ",
  "(1685)  and  Golconda  (1689),  the  noble  men  who  were  in  the https://telegram.me/UPSCMaterials https://telegram.me/FreeUPSCMaterials https://telegram.me/MaterialforExam",
  "4  FROM PLASSEY TO PARTITION ",
  "employ  of those two  kingdoms  were absorbed  into  the Mughal  aris\u00ad",
  "tocracy  and  they came  to form  what is known as the Deccani  group. ",
  "It was primarily during  the last years of Aurangzeb,  due to the incor\u00ad",
  "poration  of  the  Maratha  and  Deccani  nobles,  that the  composition ",
  "of  the  Mughal  aristocracy  underwent  a  dramatic  change,  which ",
  "brought  to  the surface  the latent  contradictions  within  its ranks.3 ",
  "The  mutual  rival and  competition  among  these  groups  of ",
  "ry ",
  "nobles,  as it is argued by some  historians,  came to a head supposedly ",
  "because  of an eighteenth  centu economic  crisis.  About  four-fifths ",
  "ry ",
  "of  the  land-revenue  income  of the  Mughal  empire  was  under  the ",
  "control  of the  rnansabdars;  but  this income  was ve unevenly  dis\u00ad",
  "ry ",
  "tributed.  In  the  middle  of the  seventeenth  century,  out  of  about ",
  "8,000  mansabdars,  only 445  controlled  61 per  cent  of the  revenue ",
  "income  of  the  empire. 4  This  naturally  created  jealousy  and  tension ",
  "within  the aristocracy,  particularly when the  resources of the empire ",
  "were  stagnant  or even  diminishing.  This economic situation-known ",
  "as the  \"jagirdari  crisis\"  of the  eighteenth  century-has  been  defined ",
  "by Satish  Chandra  in the following  words:  \"The  available  social sur\u00ad",
  "plus  was  insufficient  to  defray  the  cost of administration,  pay  for ",
  "wars of one type or another  and to give the ruling  class a standard  of ",
  "life in keeping  with  its expectations\" .5 This  happened  because  of the ",
  "unusual  increase  in the  number  of  mansabdars  at a time  when  the ",
  "area  to be distributed  as jagir (o  r paibaqi) remained  stagnant  or even ",
  "declined.  Revenue  collection,  particularly  in the south,  fell  far short ",
  "of the estimated  income,  diminishing  in turn the real income  of the ",
  "jagirdars  in disturbed  areas.  To make  matters  worse, there was a con\u00ad",
  "tinuous price  rise since the late seventeenth  century,  as the supply  of ",
  "luxu goods  flowed  towards  the  European  markets,  putting  the ",
  "ry ",
  "Mughal  aristocracy  in  further  distress.  As  too  many  mansabdars ",
  "6 ",
  "were  now  chasing  too  few jagirs,  many  of them  had  to remain  jagir\u00ad",
  "less for years; and  even when  a jagir was assigned,  there was no guar\u00ad",
  "antee  that  they would  not be transferred  within  a short  period  The ",
  "entire  aristocracy,  therefore,  suffered  from  a tremendous  sense  of ",
  "personal  insecurity. ",
  "This jagir  crisis  was not,  however,  a new  phenomenon,  as there ",
  "had  always  been  gaps  between  collection  of  revenue  and  the  esti\u00ad",
  "mated  revenue  income  of a particular  jagir.  The  crisis  increased  dur\u00ad",
  "ing the  last years  of Aurangzeb,  mainly  because of the  Deccan  wars. ",
  "There  was  now  a rise  in the  number  of  mansabdars  and  the  politi\u00ad",
  "cal  turmoil  made  the  collection  of  revenue  a  more  difficult  task ",
  "J.F.  Richards  (1975)  has  argued  that  the  problem  was to  some  ex\u00ad",
  "tent  artificial  and  due  to  wrong  policies  of  Aurangzeb,  who  was https://telegram.me/UPSCMaterials https://telegram.me/FreeUPSCMaterials https://telegram.me/MaterialforExam",
  "TRANSITION  OF THE  EIGHTEENTH  CENTURY  5 ",
  "constantly  expanding  the size of the royal land  or khalisa. There  was ",
  "a 23  per  cent  revenue  increa  e  after  the  conquest  of  Bijapur  and ",
  "Golconda.  But  instead  of distributing  this  extra  income  among  his ",
  "mansabdars,  Aurangzeb  wanted to use these resources to finance  his ",
  "Deccan  campaign.  So  the newly  conquered  lands  were  incorporated ",
  "into the royal khali  a land,  its revenue  income going directly into the ",
  "imperial  treasury  to meet the salary  demands  of the soldiers fighting ",
  "in the south  An opportunity  to solve the jagirdari  crisis was thus lost ",
  "and  therefore  Richards  thinks  that  this  crisis  was artificial  and  not ",
  "due  to any  real scarcity of  re  ources.  He has shown,  however,  that ",
  "revenue  collections  in  the  Deccan  were  gradually  falling,  while ",
  "Satish  Chandra argues  that Deccan always was a deficit area. So,  it is ",
  "difficult  to say  conclusively  how  the  conquest  of Bijapur  and  Gol\u00ad",
  "conda would  have  really  solved  the jagir  problem. ",
  "But whether artificial or real,  the jagir crisis is believed  to have led ",
  "to an unhealthy  competition  among  the nobles  in order to have con\u00ad",
  "trol over good jagirs.  Group  politic  at the Mughal  court became an ",
  "order  of the  day,  each  group  wanting  to  have  influence  over  the ",
  "emperor  to  get  access  to  good  jagirs.  After  the  death  of Bahadur ",
  "Shah  in  1712,  the  problem  reached  crisis  proportions,  as now  the ",
  "low-ranking  officials  found  it  real  hard  to  maintain  their lifestyle ",
  "with  what  they got  from  their jagirs,  as revenue  collection  became ",
  "increasingly  difficult.  The  problem  intensified  further  during  the ",
  "reigns  of Jahandar  Shah  (1712-13)  and  Farruksiyar  (1713-19).  It ",
  "did not improve  at all  during the  reign  of Muhammad  Shah  (1719-",
  "48),  when  mansabdari  ranks were  distributed  indiscriminately  for ",
  "political  reasons,  leading  to further inflation  in the  numbers  of aris\u00ad",
  "tocrats.  To meet  their  increasing  demands,  portions of khalisa  land ",
  "were  converted  into  jagir.  This  measure  could  not  fully  solve  the ",
  "problems  of the man  abdars,  but  impoverished  the emperor.  Nizarn\u00ad",
  "ul-Mulk,  after  becoming  wazir  (prime  minister)  tried  to solve  the ",
  "problem  through a redistribution  of land.  But he could  not  follow  it ",
  "7 ",
  "through,  because of strong  opposition  from  within  the  court. ",
  "Politicking  at the  imperial  court was at its height during  this time. ",
  "More generally,  the Mughal  nobility  was divided  into  three warring ",
  "factions:  the  Irani  group  led  by Asad  Khan  and  his  son  Julfiqar ",
  "Khan,  the  Turani  group,  led by Ghazi  Uddin  Khan,  Feroz  Jung and ",
  "his  son  Chin  Qulich  Khan  (Nizam-ul-Mulk)  and  the  Hindustani ",
  "group  led by the Sayyid brothers, Khan-i-Dauran,  some Afghan lead\u00ad",
  "ers and some Hindus. These factions were not organised  around eth\u00ad",
  "nicity  or  religion,  but more  on  family ties,  personal  friendship  and ",
  "above  all selfish  interests.  This faction  fighting  never  went beyond https://telegram.me/UPSCMaterials https://telegram.me/FreeUPSCMaterials https://telegram.me/MaterialforExam",

  "TRANSITION  OF THE EIGHTEENTH  CENTURY  7 ",
  "the imperial  court,  nor lapsed into  violent  confrontations.  No  one ",
  "questioned  the divine right of the Timurids  to rule; but every group ",
  "tried to extend their influence over the emperors  to control  the dis\u00ad",
  "tribution  of patronage.  Proximity  of any  particular  group  to  the ",
  "centre  of power  naturally  alienated  the  others  and  this  gradually ",
  "affected the personal bonds of loyalty between the emperor  and his ",
  "noblemen,  as disaffected  groups  found  no  reason  to  espouse  the ",
  "cause of the empire. And what was worse, this resulted in corruption ",
  "in the army. No mansabdar  maintained  the required  number  of sol\u00ad",
  "diers and horses and there was no effective supervision  either.  This ",
  "weakening  of the army was fatal for the  empire, as ultimately  the ",
  "stability  of  the  empire  depended  on  its  military  might.  That  the ",
  "Mughal  army was no  longer  invincible was successfully shown  by ",
  "the Maratha  leader Shivaji. This decline of the army became  more ",
  "palpable, as there was no fresh technological  input or organisational ",
  "innovation.  The  nobles  now  were  more  interested  in carving  out ",
  "autonomous  or  semi-autonomous  principalities  for  themselves, ",
  "which resulted  in a virtual fragmentation  of the empire. ",
  "Recurring  peasant  revolts  in  the  late  seventeenth  and  the  early ",
  "eighteenth  centuries are also believed to have been a major cause of ",
  "the decline of the Mughal empire and it is not unlikely that the crisis ",
  "of the ruling elites had something  to do with them. An empire  im\u00ad",
  "posed  from above and  its gradually  increasing economic pressures ",
  "were  perhaps  never  fully accepted  by  the  rural  society;  and  the ",
  "regional sentiments  against a centralised power had also been there. ",
  "Peasant unrest was therefore  a recurrent  theme in the history of the ",
  "Mughal  state ever since its inception. But fear of the Mughal army ",
  "always acted as a deterrent  and prevented  the problem from blowing ",
  "out of proportion. In the late seventeenth  to eighteenth  centuries, as ",
  "the  weaknesses  of  the  central  power  became  apparent  and  the ",
  "Mughal  army faced successive debacles,  and  at the  same  time  the ",
  "oppression of the Mughal ruling class increased, resistance  to impe\u00ad",
  "rial authority  also became widespread  and more  resolute.  In most ",
  "cases, these  rebellions  were led by the  disaffected  local zamindars ",
  "and  backed  fully by the oppressed  peasantry.  Eventually the  com\u00ad",
  "bined pressure of the zamindars and peasants often proved to be too ",
  "much for the Mughal authority  to withstand. ",
  "These revolts can be interpreted  in various ways. They can be por\u00ad",
  "trayed as political assertion of regional and communitarian  identities ",
  "against  an  intruding  centralising  power  or  as  reactions  against ",
  "the bigoted religious policies of Aurangzeb. The latter interpretation ",
  "seems to be more unlikely, as in the later pan of his reign, Aurangzeb https://telegram.me/UPSCMaterials https://telegram.me/FreeUPSCMaterials https://telegram.me/MaterialforExam",
  "8  FROM  PLASSEY  TO  PARTITION ",
  "was showing  more  liberalism  towards the  non-believers  and in fact ",
  "wooing  many  of  the  Hindu  local  chieftains  in  a  cool  calculating ",
  "move  to  win  their  loyalty  and  solve  the  political  problems  of the ",
  "8 ",
  "empire  by isolating  his enemies.  But the real  reasons  behind  these ",
  "revolts,  as some historians  argue  on the other  hand,  could  be found ",
  "in the property-relations  of the Mughal empire.  Whether  or not the ",
  "emperor was the owner of all lands in his empire  is a debatable  issue; ",
  "but he certainly  had  an unquestionable  right over the income of the ",
  "land  which was collected  in the form of land revenue,  the amount  of ",
  "which  was gradually  increasing  since the Sultani  period.  Irfan  Habib ",
  "(1963)  has shown  that the Mughal  land-revenue  system  rested  on  a ",
  "compromise:  the peasant was left  with  sufficient  provision  for sub\u00ad",
  "sistence  while  the  surplus,  as far  as possible,  was  extracted  by the ",
  "state in the form of land revenue.  It is not true that the Mughal  peas\u00ad",
  "ant was left with no surplus at all;  for continuing  production,  he was ",
  "certainly  left with  some,  while  differentiation  within the peasantry ",
  "also  indicates  that.  But on the whole,  although  larger  pea  ants could ",
  "withstand  the  pressure,  the  smaller  peasantry  increasingly  felt  op\u00ad",
  "zabt ",
  "pres ed. 9 Usually in the  areas (where a detailed  land survey was ",
  "undertaken)  the  revenue  demand  was one-third  of the produce,  but ",
  "the actual  amount varied from  region  to region.  In some areas it was ",
  "half of  the  produce  and in fertile  regions like  Gujarat it was as high ",
  "as three-fourths.  Part of it, collected  from  the khalisa  land,  went to ",
  "the  imperial  treasury,  while  the  larger  portion  (80  per  cent  in ",
  "Aurangzeb's  time) went to  the jagirdars. ",
  "Below  the  demand  of the  state  and  above  that  of the  peasants, ",
  "there  was another  kind  of demand  on  the  income  of the  land,  and ",
  "that  was  the  demand  of the  local  landlords  or  zamindars.  There ",
  "was differentiation  among  the  zarnindars.P  Some  of them,  like the ",
  "Rajput  chiefs  of Rajasthan,  were  fairly  big rajas  with  considerable ",
  "local  political  power.  They  were  incorporated  into  the  Mughal ",
  "(peshkash) ",
  "bureaucracy,  as in return  for a fixed  payment  and  loyalty ",
  "to the emperor,  their  autonomous  power  over  their  own  territory or ",
  "uatan  mulgujari ",
  "was recognised.  At the  bottom  were the  or primary ",
  "zamindars,  who had an independent  right over the land and in many ",
  "cases it was through  them that  revenue  was collected  from  the peas\u00ad",
  "nankar ",
  "ants and  in  return  they  got  or  revenue-free  land.  Between ",
  "these  two groups  were  the intermediary  zamindars  who  collected ",
  "revenue  from  their own zamindari as well  from other  primary  zamin\u00ad",
  "dars,  Below  the zamindars  were the peasants  who were also differen\u00ad",
  "khudkashts ",
  "tiated:  the  were  peasants  with  occupancy  rights,  while ",
  "pahikashts ",
  "the  were  vagrant  peasants.  There  were  close  community https://telegram.me/UPSCMaterials https://telegram.me/FreeUPSCMaterials https://telegram.me/MaterialforExam",
  "TRANSITION  OF THE  EIGHTEENTH  CENTURY  9 ",
  "relations  based  on  caste,  clan  and  religion  between  the  primary ",
  "zamindars  and the peasants.  This was an important source  of power ",
  "for the zamindars,  many of whom  controlled  small  armies  and  fort  . ",
  "The  Mughal  administration  in the interior  could not therefore  func\u00ad",
  "tion  without  their  active  cooperation.  Akbar  had  tried  to  tum  the ",
  "zamindars  into  collaborators;  but  from  the late years of Aurangzeb, ",
  "particularly  after  the  war  of  succession  ( 1707- 8)  following  his ",
  "death,  the  loyalty  of  the  zamindars  definitely  began  to  flounder.'! ",
  "In the  Deccan,  towards  the  last  years of  Bahadur  Shah's  reign,  all ",
  "the  zamindars,  both  primary  and  intermediary,  turned  against  the ",
  "Mughal  state with  the active support  of the hard pressed  peasantry .12 ",
  "One  major  reason  for  the  open  defiance  of  the  local  landlords ",
  "might  have been  the increasing  oppression  of the jagirdars.  The ear\u00ad",
  "lier  emperors  tried  to keep  them  in check  through  a system  of rota\u00ad",
  "tion.  Irfan  Habib  (1963)  has  argued  that  because  of  this  Mughal ",
  "system,  and  by taking  advantage  of it,  the jagirdars  oppressed  the ",
  "peasantry.  As they were  :frequently  transferred,  they did  not  develop ",
  "any attachment  or any long-term  interest  in  the  estate  and  tried  to ",

  "tract as much  as possible.  This trend  was quite visible  in Golconda ",
  "after  its subjugation.'!  Later,  in  the  last  years  of  Bahadur  Shah's ",
  "reign,  a number  of jagirdars  in the Deccan  made  compromises  with ",
  "the Maratha  sardars ( chiefs)  and  that arrangement  allowed  them  to ",
  "collect  as  much  as  possible  from  the  peasantry.  Sometimes  they ",
  "collected  advances  from  the  amils  (revenue  officials),  who  in  turn ",
  "extorted as much  as they  could  from  the  peasants.  14  On the other ",
  "hand,  those who  were  more  :frequently  transferred  found  the  local ",
  "conditions  too  turbulent for the collection  of  revenue.  To solve this ",
  "problem  and  to  squeeze  maximum  benefit  within  a  short  period, ",
  "they  devised  the  ijaradari system,  through  which  revenue-collecting ",
  "right  was  farmed  out  to the  highest  bidder.  The  revenue  farmer's ",
  "demand  was often  much higher  than the actual  revenue  demand  and ",
  "the pressures ultimately  moved  downward  to the primary  zamindars ",
  "and the peasants.  During  the rime of Farruksiyar's  reign even khalisa ",
  "lands were  being  given over to the ijaradars, ",
  "The  Mughal  compromise  is believed  to  have  completely  broken ",
  "down  as a  result,  and  the  primary  zamindars  began  to  defy  the ",

  "more disturbed areas, such as Deccan, zamindari  defiance became an ",
  "order  of the day.  Even  in the heart  of Mughal  north  India  in the ",
  "eighteenth  century,  there  was  a  widespread  tendency  among  the ",
  "zamindars  to defy the central authority,  withhold  revenue  payment ",
  "and  to  resist  the Mughal  state when  it forcibly tried  to collect  it.is ",
  "Because of their community  ties with the peasants, they could easily ",
  "mobilise them against the MughaJ power.  For the peasants also, this ",
  "zamindari  initiative  solved the problem  of leadership,  as they often ",
  "found  it difficult  to challenge  on their  own  a centralised  authority ",
  "and continue  their struggle  for a very long time. The peasant  griev\u00ad",
  "ances in late Mughal  period were, therefore,  often organised around ",
  "religious  and  regional  identities.  The Maratha  sardars  took  advan\u00ad",
  "tage of the  peasant  grievances;  the jat  peasants  were  mobilised  in ",
  "north  India by their  zamindars;  the  Sikhs rose in revolt  in Punjab; ",
  "and  the  Rajput  chiefs withdrew  their  allegiance  in  Rajasthan.  All ",
  "these revolts led to the formation  of autonomous  kingdoms  in dif\u00ad",
  "ferent  parts of the empire,  further  attenuating  the authority  of the ",
  "Mughals.  The eighteenth  century  thus witnessed the rise of a variety ",
  "of regional  states, some of which  built  on \"older  local  or regional ",
  "tradirion( s)  of state  formation\",  others  focused  on  ethnic  identity ",
  "and  associated  \"notions  of 'community\"'  By the  end  of the cen\u00ad",
  ".16 ",
  "tury,  effective  rule of the Mughal  emperor was confined  only to a ",
  "narrow  stretch  around  the capital  city of Delhi.  In 185 8 when  the ",
  "English deposed  the last emperor  Bahadur  Shah II, they only ended ",
  "the fiction  of his imperiunl. ",
  "To some historians,  however, poverty  and economic  pressure  do ",
  "not  seem  to be a wholly adequate  explanation  for these  rebellions ",
  "and the eventual  decline of the Mughal  state,  since there  had been ",
  "significant  regional  variations  in local economies.  The  recent 'revi\u00ad",
  "sionist'  literature,  therefore,  wants us to move away from this cen\u00ad",
  "trist view  and to look at the situation  from a different perspective\u00ad",
  "the perspective  of the periphery.  The Mughal  decline,  according to ",
  "this new history, is the result of the rise of new groups into economic ",
  "and political power and the inability of a distant  and weakened cen\u00ad",
  "tre to control them any longer. In the entire  history  of Mughal  em\u00ad",
  "pire there is more evidence  of prosperity  and growth  than of decline ",
  "and crisis.  There  is no denying  that  even in the eighteenth  century ",
  "there  had  been  regions  with  surplus  resources,  like  for  example, ",
  "Moradabad-Bareilly,  Awadh  and  Banaras;  but  the  Mughal  state ",
  "could not appropriate this surplus and the resources accumulated  in ",
  "the hands  of local zamindars. 17  Bengal was another surplus  area. In ",

  "gious and  political orientation  to  their  newly  established  agrarian ",
  "communities, while the provincial officials could easily carve out for ",
  "themselves  new revenue  units around  these agrarian  settlements.\" ",
  "The  rising agricultural production  in some areas and monetisation ",
  "of the economy, in other  words,  made available more  resources  at ",
  "the  disposal  of the zamindars  and  peasants,  and  powerful  local lin\u00ad",
  "eages, who gained distinctively greater advantage and confidence vis\u00ad",
  "a-vis the imperial centre.\"  Taking advantage of a weakening  central ",
  "control, they now found it more convenient to repudiate  their alle\u00ad",
  "giance to a centralised  imperial  power  and  assert their  autonomy, ",
  "while still maintaining the cultural  and ideological framework of the ",
  "Mughal  state. ",
  "Possibilities for such diffusion of power had always been there in ",
  "Mughal India, it has been argued. There were corporate  groups and ",
  "social classes  who  enjoyed,  despite  a supposedly  obtrusive central ",
  "authority, various  kinds of rights  that constituted,  in CA  Bayly's ",
  "terminology, their  \"portfolio  capital\",  which they could  invest to ",
  "reap huge profits. 20 According to this school of history, throughout ",
  "the Mughal period  there had been a constant  process of reconcilia\u00ad",
  "tion  and  adjustment  between  the  central  power  and  the  regional ",
  "elite. Mughal sovereignty,  as Andre  Wink has argued,  rested  on  a ",
  "\"balancing  system  of  continually  shifting  rivalries  and  alliances.\" ",
  "The  Mughal  system was prepared  to accommodate  or sedi\u00ad",
  "''jitna\" ",
  "tion, and always tried to incorporate  the ascendant  localised powers, ",
  "either  indigenous  or foreign, into its concept of universal dominion ",
  "and  on the  effective functioning  of this  mechanism  of conciliation ",
  "and coercion  depended  its continued  existence.\"  The Mughal  pro\u00ad",
  "cess of centralisation,  in  other  words,  left  enough  space  for  the ",
  "continued  existence of rival principles of organisation.  Frank Perlin, ",
  "in this context,  has talked about the existence of a \"'library'  of cate\u00ad",
  "gories and techniques\",  implying a multiplicity of systems of govern\u00ad",
  "ance, methods of measurement and techniques of collecting revenue, ",
  "varying widely in space and rime. There  was multiplicity  of rights, ",
  "like the concept of vatan in the Deccan, which meant heritable rights ",
  "that could not be taken away even by kings. Attempts at centralisa\u00ad",
  "tion could not eliminate those rights in the eighteenth  century.22 So, ",
  "as Muz.affar Alam sums up the situation,  around  this time, because ",
  "of decentralisation  and  commercialisation,  a  group  of  \"upstarts\" ",
  "had come to monopolise the resources oft he empire at the exclusion ",
  "of the hereditary Mughal nobility or the  23 These upstarts ",

  "provinces and successfully contested the centralising tendency  of the ",
  "MughaJ state. This group  included the jagirdars who defied  transfer ",
  "and thus became local rulers, and the revenue  farmers-or  the new ",
  "\"entrepreneurs  in revenue\"-who  \"combined  military  power  with ",
  "expertise in managing cash and local trade\" .24 \"Consistent  economic ",
  "growth  and  prosperity\",  rather  than  poverty  and  crisis,  thus  pro\u00ad",
  "vided \"the context  of the local political turmoil\".\"  The Mughal sys\u00ad",
  "tem, in other  words, had always left a space for the rise of powerful ",
  "regional  groups  and significant economic  and social changes in the ",
  "eighteenth  century  brought  that possibility into  sharper  focus. But ",
  "then  these  new  developments  were  not  properly  recognised  or ",
  "accommodated  within the system, and hence its eventual demise. ",
  "It is difficult to arrive at a convenient  middle ground  between  the ",
  "'conventional' and  'revisionist'  histories;  nor  is it easy  to dismiss ",
  "either  of them.  The  revisionist  history  has been  taken  to  task  for ",
  "underestimating  the  cohesiveness  of the  Mughal  empire  and  for ",
  "ignoring  the contemporary  Muslim concepts  of centralised  sover\u00ad",
  "eignty. These critics, on the other hand, have been assailed for cling\u00ad",
  "ing on to a mindset  that is accustomed  to look at the Mughal  empire ",
  "only as a centralised  structure. 26  If there is any shared ground  at all, ",
  "as Athar Ali admits in his critique of the revisionist historiography,  it ",
  "is in the common  recognition  of the fact that the zarnindars  or the ",
  "intermediary  classes \"constituted  a centrifugal  force\" in the Mughal ",
  "structure. 27 We may, however,  conclude  by saying that the  idea of ",
  "'decline'  is perhaps an inadequate  theme for understanding  the eigh\u00ad",
  "teenth century in Indian history. The Mughal system continued  even ",
  "long after the de facto demise of the empire, which was followed by ",
  "the emergence of a number of regional powers. The eighteenth  cen\u00ad",
  "tury in Indian history is not a dark age, nor an age of overall decline. ",
  "The  decline of one  pan-Indian  empire  was followed  by the rise of ",
  "another,  the  intervening  period  being  dominated  by a  variety  of ",
  "powerful  regional states. This century  should,  therefore,  be consid\u00ad",
  "ered, as Satish Chandra  (1991) has argued,  as a distinct chronologi\u00ad",
  "cal whole. ",

  "EMERGENCE  OF THE  REGIONAL  POWERS ",
  "By 1761 the Mughal  empire was empire only in name, as its weak\u00ad",
  "nesses had enabled the local powers to assert their independence.  Yet ",
  "the symbolic authority  of the Mughal emperor  continued,  as he was ",
  "still considered  to be a source of political legitimacy. The new states ",
  "did  not  directly  challenge  his authority  and  constantly  sought  his ",
  "sanction  to legitimise their rule. In many areas of governance  these https://telegram.me/UPSCMaterials https://telegram.me/FreeUPSCMaterials https://telegram.me/MaterialforExam",

  "states continued  the Mughal  institutions and the administrative sys\u00ad",
  "tem;  where changes occurred-and they did occur, of course-they ",
  "came  rather  lowly, to accommodate  the altered power  relations  in ",
  "the regions. The emergence of these scares in the eighteenth  century, ",
  "therefore,  repre enred a transformation  rather  than collapse of the ",
  "polity. It signified a decentralisation  of power and not a power vac\u00ad",
  "uum or political  chaos. These new states were of various kinds with ",
  "diverse histories: some of them were founded by Mughal provincial ",
  "governors,  some were set up by the rebels against the Mughal state; ",
  "and a few states which asserted their independence were previously ",
  "functioning as autonomous  but dependent  polities. ",
  "Bengal, Hyderabad  and Aw  adh were the three successor states of ",
  "the Mughal empire, in the sense chat they were founded by Mughal ",
  "provincial governors who never  formally severed their links with the ",
  "centre, but virtually  exercised  autonomy in matters of execution of ",
  "power at the local level. The province or the subah of Bengal gradu\u00ad",
  "ally  became  independent  of Mughal  control  after  Murshid  Quli ",
  "Khan became the governor  in  1717.2s  Initially, Aurangzeb had  ap\u00ad",
  "pointed him the diwan (collector of revenue) of Bengal to streamline ",
  "the revenue administration  of the province. Then  in 1710  Bahadur ",
  "Shah  reappointed  him in this position  after  a  short _break of two ",
  "years. When Farruksiyarbecame the emperor, he confirmed Murshid ",
  "Quli in his position and also appointed him the deputy governor of ",
  "Bengal and governor of Orissa. Later in 1717  when he was appointed ",
  "the governor or Nazim  of Bengal,  he was given  the unprecedented ",
  "privilege  of holding  the two offices of nazim and  diwan simulta\u00ad",
  "neously. The division of power, which was maintained  throughout ",
  "the Mughal period  to keep both the imperial officers under control ",
  "through  a system of checks and balances,  was thus done away with. ",
  "This helped Murshid Quli, who was already known for his efficient ",
  "revenue administration,  to consolidate  his position further.  He did ",
  "not of course formally defy Mughal authority and regularly sent rev\u00ad",
  "enue to the imperial treasury. Indeed, the Bengal revenue was often ",
  "the only regular income for the beleaguered Mughal emperors  dur\u00ad",
  "ing periods of financial stringency and uncertainty. But behind  the ",
  "veneer  of  formal  allegiance  to  the  Timurid  rulers,  Murshid  Quli ",
  "began to enjoy a considerable  amount of autonomy within his own ",
  "domain  and initiated almost a dynastic rule. He was indeed the last ",
  "governor  of Bengal appointed  by the Mughal emperor. ",
  "The foundation  ofMurshid  Quli's power was of course his very ",
  "successful revenue administration, which even in the days of politi\u00ad",
  "cal chaos elsewhere in the empire, made Bengal a constant  revenue https://telegram.me/UPSCMaterials https://telegram.me/FreeUPSCMaterials https://telegram.me/MaterialforExam",

  "paying surplus area. It is difficult to determine  whether  or not he ",
  "was oppressive or that revenue demand during his period increased ",
  "significantly;  but  revenue  collection  had  shot  up  by 20  per  cent ",
  "between  1700  and 1722.  This efficient collection system was oper\u00ad",
  "ated through  powerful  intermediary zamindars.  Murshid  Quli sent ",
  "his  investigators to every revenue-paying  area to  make  a detailed ",
  "survey and compelled the zamindars to pay in full and on time. For ",
  "this purpose,  he encouraged  the  development  of a few powerful ",
  "zamindaris  at the expense of smaller  inefficiently managed  zamin\u00ad",
  "daris,  while refractory zamindars were  punished  and  some of the ",
  "jagirdars were transferred  to the outlying province of Orissa,  their ",
  "estates being converted into khalisa or royal land.29 ",
  "The  period  between  1717  and  1726  therefore  witnessed  the ",
  "emergence  of a few landed  magnates.  These magnates assisted  the ",
  "nazim  in  the  timely  collection  of  revenue  and  with  his  patron\u00ad",
  "age they also  expanded  their  own estates.3 0  Indeed, by the time of ",
  "Murshid Quli's death in 1727, fifteen largest zamindariswere respon\u00ad",
  "sible for about  half of the revenue of the province. But along with ",
  "the rise  of the  zamindars  as a new  powerful  elite  in the  province, ",
  "there  was also the  growing  importance of merchants  and  bankers ",
  "during  this  period.  Bengal  always had  a  lucrative  trade,  and  the ",
  "political  stability and  increase  in  agricultural  productivity  during ",
  "Murshid  Quli's  period  provided  further impetus  to such  trading ",
  "activities. In the seventeenth  century,  silk and cotton textile,  sugar, ",
  "oil and clarified  butter  from Bengal  went through overland  route to ",
  "Persia and Afghanistan  via  a number of north and west Indian dis\u00ad",
  "tributing centres  and  on  the  oceanic  route  through  the  port  of ",
  "Hughli to the Southeast Asian, Persian Gulf and  Red Sea ports. Dur\u00ad",
  "ing the political  turmoil  of the  eighteenth  century, traffic through ",
  "the overland route partially declined,  but oceanic trade thrived with ",
  "increasing investment  from the European  Companies-the Dutch, ",
  "the French  and  the English.  During the  first  half  of the  century, ",
  "Europe certainly became the major destination  for goods from Ben\u00ad",
  "gal, and  this had a significant  impact on the textile  industry  in the ",
  "region.  Bengal always enjoyed  a favourable balance  of trade, with ",
  "surplus bullion brought in by the European Companies to buy Ben\u00ad",
  "gal goods  and this was absorbed smoothly  into the cash economy ",
  "and  revenue  remittance  structure.  On  the Indian  side  this  trade ",
  "was dominated  by a variety  of merchants-Hindus,  Muslims and ",
  "Armenians.  Some of them were magnates, like the Hindu  merchant ",
  "Umi Chand or the Armenian  tycoon Khoja Wajid who controlled a ",
  "fleet of ships. And they enjoyed a very cordial relation with the state https://telegram.me/UPSCMaterials https://telegram.me/FreeUPSCMaterials https://telegram.me/MaterialforExam",
  "15 ",
  "TRANSITION  OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY ",
  "and  bureaucracy,  as the Mughal  state  traditionally  never  tried  to ",
  "squeeze  the merchants.\"  On the other hand, the constant  pressure ",
  "on the zamindars  to pay revenue in time and  its regular  remittance ",
  "to the imperial  treasury  in  Delhi  brought  powerful  financiers  and ",
  "bankers into great demand.  They  provided  securities at every stage ",
  "of the transaction and enjoyed unprecedented patronage of the gov\u00ad",
  "ernor,  thus providing the main supportive pillar of his power.  The ",
  "most significant story of such collaboration  was the rise of the bank\u00ad",
  "ing house of j agar Seth,  who eventually became the treasurer of the ",
  "provincial government in 1730,  with strategic control over the mint. ",
  "Apart from zamindars,  merchants  and bankers,  Murshid  Quli also ",
  "ensured  the loyalty of the officials, by appointing  his friends,  rela\u00ad",
  "tives  and  loyalists  in important  positions and  driving  his potential ",
  "enemies out of the province-a  situation which could not be dreamt ",
  "of in the heyday of the Mughal  empire.\" ",
  "Murshid  Quli,  however,  never did sever his formal  connections ",
  "with the Mughals  and continued  to send the annual  Bengal  revenue ",
  "to Delhi regularly. But within his own domain he acted as an autono\u00ad",
  "mous ruler and in a true  dynastic fashion named his daughter's  son ",
  "Sarfaraz  Khan his successor. But Sarfaraz  was ousted  by his father ",
  "Shujauddin  Muhammad  Khan  (Murshid  Quli's  son-in-law),  who ",
  "took control  of the two provinces of Bengal and Orissa in 1727 and ",
  "had  his  position  endorsed  by  the  Mughal  emperor  Muhammad ",
  "Shah. He  too  maintained  the  relationship with  the  Mughal court, ",
  "but enjoyed autonomy in matters of local administration,  which  was ",
  "supported by the new forces of Bengal  politics,  the zamindars,  mer\u00ad",
  "chants and the bankers.  By the 1730s,  as Philip  Calkins  argues, \"the ",
  "government  of Bengal  began to look  more like government  by co\u00ad",
  "operation of the dominant  forces in Bengal, rather  than the imposi\u00ad",
  "tion  of the rule from  outside\".\"  However,  it is also  true that this ",
  "gradual  rise in the power  of the merchants,  bankers and zamindars ",
  "also meant a relative diminution  of the authority  of the nazim. This ",
  "became quite evident  in a coup in 1739-40,  in which Shujauddin's ",
  "son  Sarfaraz Khan, who had become the new nazim, was ousted  by ",
  "his army commander  Alivardi Khan,  with  the help  of the banking ",
  "family ofjagat Serhs and a few powerful  zamindars. Sarfaraz  had to ",
  "go not just because he was an inefficient administrator, but because ",
  "he had alienated  the house of Jagat Seth, and had lost the support of ",
  "a few powerful  officials. With his deposition the office of the nazim ",
  "went to an able military general, Alivardi Khan, who later obtained ",
  "imperial sanctions for his appointment. ",
  "It was Alivardi's  reign,  which  marked  a virtual  break  with  the ",

  "reference  to the emperor  and finally, the  regular flow of revenue to ",
  "Delhi was stopped.  Although there was never any formal defiance of ",
  "the  Mughal  authority,  for  all  practical  purposes  an  autonomous ",
  "administration,  free of all sorts of imperial control,  had now emer\u00ad",
  "ged in Bengal,  Bihar and Orissa.  The major  problems  for Alivardi ",
  "came from outside:  he had to face Maratha  depredations  and Afghan ",
  "rebellion.  The  Marathas  from  the  west  in their  search  for  a pan\u00ad",
  "Indian empire  invaded  Bengal a number  of times, causing immense ",
  "damage  to  life and  property.  Ultimately  in 1751,  Alivardi came  to ",
  "terms  with  the  Marathas  by agreeing  to  pay chauth (o  ne-fourth  of ",
  "the  revenue)  and handing  over Orissa.  But in the meanwhile  some ",
  "rebel  Afghan  troops  under  the  leadership  of Mustafa  Khan  had ",
  "taken  over  Patna  in  1748  and  thus  had  posed  another  great  chal\u00ad",
  "lenge to his authority.  Alivardi eventually succeeded in putting down ",
  "the Afghans and recovered Pama. However,  one major fallout of the ",
  "Maratha  raids was the disruption  of Bengal trade,  particularly  of the ",
  "overland  trade with north  and west India. But it was short-lived and ",
  "the  recovery  was  aided  by a  massive  increase  in  European  trade, ",
  "both  corporate  trade  of the  Companies  and  private  trade  of their ",
  "officials. They could not immediately  dislodge the Indian merchants ",
  "from the market,  but it certainly signified the beginning ofEuropean ",
  "dominance  in the trading world ofBengal, preparing  the ground  for ",
  "an eventual  English takeover  of the province34-a  development  we ",
  "shall discuss in detail  later.  Alivardi died  in 1756,  nominating  his ",
  "grandson  Siraj-ud-daula  his successor. But his succession  was chal\u00ad",
  "lenged by two other contenders for the throne,  Shaukat Jung (Faujdar ",
  "of Purnea) and Ghaseti Begum (Alivardi's daughter). This resulted in ",
  "intense  court  factionalism,  as the  overmighty  zamindars  and  com\u00ad",
  "mercial people  felt threatened  by an extremely  ambitious and asser\u00ad",
  "tive young nawab.\"  This destabilised the administration  of Bengal, ",
  "and  the advantage  was taken  by the  English East India  Company, ",
  "which acquired  a foothold  in Bengal politics through  what is popu\u00ad",
  "larly known  as the Plasscy conspiracy of 1757  that ended the rule of ",
  "Siraj-ud-daula.  This story of yet another  transition  in Bengal politics ",
  "we shall see in a short  while. ",
  "The autonomous  kingdom ofHyderabad  was founded  in 1724 by ",
  "a powerful  noble  at  the  imperial  court,  Chin  Qulich  Khan,  who ",
  "eventually took the title of Nizam-ul-Mulk  Asaf]ah I. Known as the ",
  "leader of the Turani party, he felt frustrated  in court  politics due to ",
  "the  haughty  assertion  of power  by the  Indian  Muslirh  faction  led ",
  "by the  Sayyid brothers,  who  had  emperor  Farruksiyar  killed  and ",

  "feated Mubariz and the following year he took over as the Subahdar ",
  "of  Deccan  and  consolidated  his  power  around  Hyderabad.  The ",
  "actual independence  of the Hyderabad  kingdom  may be dated from ",
  "17 40 when  finally the nizarn left north  India to settle there perma\u00ad",
  "nently. He subdued  the refractory zamindars  and showed  tolerance ",
  "towards  the Hindus who had economic power in their hands and as ",
  "a result, Hyderabad witnessed the emergence of a new regional elite ",
  "who supported  the nizarn. By the rime ofhis death in 1748, the state ",
  "of Hyderabad was a recognisable power in Deccan politics, acknow\u00ad",
  "ledging Mughal suzerainty  only in a symbolic sense.  Coins were still ",
  "minted in the name of the Mughal emperor; his name also figured in ",
  "the khutba or the Friday prayers.  But for all practical purposes, the ",
  "nizarn acted  independently, conducting  wars, signing  treaties, con\u00ad",
  "ferring  mansabs and  making  important  appointments  without  any ",
  "reference  to the emperor. ",
  "Soon,  however,  after  the  death  of the  first  nizam,  Asaf jah  I, ",
  "Hyderabad  began  to  experience  a series  of crises.  While  Maratha ",
  "depredations  continued  to be a major source ofa  nxiety, a war of suc\u00ad",
  "cession ensued  between  his son Nasir Jung and grandson Muzaffar ",
  "Jung,  the  advantage  of  that  disunion  being  taken  by the  French ",
  "under Dupleix. Muzaffar emerged  victorious from this contest with ",
  "French support and gave handsome  monetary  rewards and  territo\u00ad",
  "rial concessions to  the  French.  But that  did  not  end  his  problems, ",
  "as  during  the  subsequent  years,  the  Marathas,  Mysore  and  the ",
  "Carnatic-all  settled  their territorial  scores against Hyderabad.  The ",
  "situation  improved again after  1762 during the period  ofNizam Ali ",
  "Khan, whoseized control  of the administration  and during his long ",
  "reign  lasting up to  1803,  he settled  border disputes with  his neigh\u00ad",
  "bours, giving Hyderabad  the much desired political stability. ",
  "The Hyderabadi  administrative  system did  not  to destroy the ",
  "try ",
  "indigenous  power  structures  within  the  territory,  but  sought  to ",
  "incorporate  them  into  a \"patron-client  relationship\"  with  the ",
  "cen\u00ad",
  "tral  power.  The  locally  entrenched  semi-autonomous  rulers  were ",

  "tribute or peshkash paid to the nizam,  The locally powerful traders, ",
  "money lenders and the military aristocracy also played a crucial role ",
  "in the Hyderabad  polity, by providing valuable  financial  and mili\u00ad",
  "tary support to the nizam, who emerged as the chief patron  within ",
  "the polity.  Under  this new administration, the old Mughal institu\u00ad",
  "tions were not  totally thrown  out,  but  they underwent  substantial ",
  "changes in content. Land revenue was collected through  powerful ",
  "intermediary  revenue farmers; but unlike the Mughal practice, there ",
  "was very little attempt to keep them under control. The jagirs under ",
  "this new system became hereditary and the mansabdari system only ",
  "retained a few of its Mughal features. There  was also a remarkable ",
  "change in the composition of the nobility:  while  the older  military ",
  "aristocracy  retained  some of its power, some new men with exper\u00ad",
  "tise in revenue and financial management rose from lower ranks. On ",
  "the  whole, \"power  remained  widely diffused\" in the  Hyderabadi ",
  "administrative structure.36  By the  end  of the eighteenth  century, ",
  "Hyderabad  represented  a  relatively  new  political  system  with  a ",
  "whole range of new participants,  who had diverse origins and social ",
  "background. ",
  "Another Mughal province that became autonomous  in the course ",
  "of the eighteenth century was Awadh. Saadat Khan was appointed ",
  "the Mughal governor  of Awadh in  I 722 with the difficult charge of ",
  "subduing rebellions by the local rajas and chiefs.  He accomplished ",
  "this task within a year and in appreciation, the emperor Muhammad ",
  "Shah conferred on him the title ofBurhan-ul-Mulk. Soon after this, ",
  "Saadat Khan returned to the capital to consolidate his position in the ",
  "imperial court, but ended up in a quarrel with  one of Muhammad ",
  "Shah's  favourites and  was again forced  to  return  to Awadh.  Frus\u00ad",
  "trated in court politics, Saadat then decided to build up a power base ",
  "in Awadh and as a first step had his son-in-law  Safdar Jung recog\u00ad",
  "nised by the emperor as his deputy governor. The other step towards ",
  "the  establishment  of his dynastic rule was to  make  the  office of ",
  "di wan virtually independent  of all imperial control. The revenues of ",
  "Awadh from then on were handled by a Punjabi  Khatri official who ",
  "functioned  under Saadat  Khan  and  never  reported  anything to the ",
  "imperial office. ",
  "The problem of refractory zamindars in Awadh was solved in time ",
  "and a new land  revenue settlement was introduced with the revenue ",
  "demand  increasing by  more  than  half.  The  jagirdari  system  was ",
  "reformed, with jagirs being granted to the local gentry, while a rich ",
  "flow of trade kept the province affluent. This resulted in the creation ",
  "of a new regional ruling elite, consisting  mainly of Indian Muslims, ",
  "Afghans and Hindus  who became Saadat's  main support base. But https://telegram.me/UPSCMaterials https://telegram.me/FreeUPSCMaterials https://telegram.me/MaterialforExam",

  "the latter kept the communication  channels  open with the imperial ",
  "court.  Indeed, during this whole period  he constantly expanded  the ",
  "frontiers  of the  Awadh  subah,  but  never  without  the  formal  ap\u00ad",
  "proval of the emperor.  He also nurtured his old ambitions  in impe\u00ad",
  "rial court politics, but only to be frustrated  again in 1739-40 when ",
  "the  position  of mir bakshi  (imperial  treasurer)  went  to the  nizam, ",
  "despite  the  services  he  had  rendered  during  the  invasion  of  the ",
  "Persian  king  Nadir Shah.  He  considered  this  a  betrayal  and  in ",
  "vengeance  changed sides to join the  Persian invader.  But he could ",
  "not suffer the arrogance  and haughty behaviour  of Nadir Shah and ",
  "the  day  after  the  occupation  of  Delhi,  in  sheer  frustration  and ",
  "despondency,  he poisoned  himself to death.  However,  by the time ",
  "he died in 1740,  Saadat had certainly  developed  in Awadh a semi\u00ad",
  "autonomous  regional political system, with vastly reduced  financial ",
  "commitment  to, but no formal disjunction  with, the Mughal  rate. ",
  "Nadir Shah remained  the emperor  of India for just two months ",
  "and he settled the succession question in Awadh by accepting twenty ",
  "million rupees as peshkash from Safdar Jung. Muhammad  Shah later ",
  "confirmed  this appointment  and conferred  on him an imperial title. ",
  "But Safdar Jung's  opportunities  really came when both Muhammad ",
  "Shah and  the Nizam-ul-Mulk  died  in 1748  and  he was appointed ",
  "wazir by the new emperor  Ahmad  Shah.  Saf dar Jung extended  his ",
  "sphere  of influence  by using the  new  imperial  position,  the  most ",
  "important of these gains being the seizure ofFarukhabad  from the ",
  "Pathans.  But  on  the  other hand,  this  self-aggrandisement  of  the ",
  "wazir soon  alienated  both  rhe imperial  family as well as the court ",
  "nobles who ultimately contrived his ouster in 1753. The year marked ",
  "an important  turning  point in the political history of north India, as ",
  "Richard  Barnett  points  out,  by signifying \"the visible secession  of ",
  "A wadh  and  Allahabad  from  the  remainder  of  the  dwindling  em\u00ad",
  "pire,,. 37  The  formal  connection  was yet to  be severed  fully. After ",
  "Safdar Jung's death  in late 1754,  his only son  Shuja-ud-daula  was ",
  "again  appointed  the  governor  of Awadh  by  the  puppet emperor ",
  "Alamgir  11.  And Shuja too successfully maintained  the  autonomy ",
  "of  the  Awadh  sub ah  without  ever  formally  defying  the  symbolic ",
  "authority  of the Mughal emperor. When  in December  1759  on the ",
  "death of Alamgir II, the fugitive crown  prince staged his own coro\u00ad",
  "nation  as Shah Alam II, he named  Shuja his wazir. Although  this ",
  "position was merely fictional, Shuja maintained  his power within his ",
  "own  domain  and was a much sought  after ally for both  the parties ",
  "when  Afghan leader  Ahmad  Shah Abdali arrived  again in India to ",

  "humbled  and  weakened;  but  throughout  this  confrontation  he ",
  "behaved like  an independent partner  in an alliance  of equals.  Within ",
  "his own domain of Awadh and Allahabad his autonomy and power ",
  "remained  unchallenged till his encounter  with the English East India ",
  "Company  in  1764.JS ",
  "Apart  from these successor states formed  by Mughal governors, ",
  "the other states that emerged  in eighteenth-century  India were those ",
  "founded by rebels  against the Mughal  state,  such as the Marathas, ",
  "the  Sikhs,  the Jars and  the  Afghan  kingdoms  of  Farukhabad  and ",
  "Rohilkhand. Among them it was perhaps only the Maratha state that ",
  "had the potential  co develop into a new pan-Indian empire replacing ",
  "the Mughals;  but that potential  was never  fully realised  because of ",
  "the nature of the Mararha polity itself. In the seventeenth century  it ",
  "began as a small  kingdom in western India, founded by the legend\u00ad",
  "ary Maratha  chief  Shivaji,  against  stiff opposition  from  the  local ",
  "Muslim kingdom  of Bijapur  and the pressure of the mighty Mughal ",
  "army.  Soon  after  his  death  in  1680,  it  was  troubled  by dynastic ",
  "factionalism  and  the constant  pressure  of the Mughal  policy of con\u00ad",
  "quest in the Deccan. Local deshmukhs (revenue officers) and zarnin\u00ad",
  "dars took advantage of the situation  by sometimes aligning with the ",
  "Mughals and sometimes  joining  hands with  the Marathas. Two of ",
  "Shivaji's  sons,  first Shambhaji and then  Rajaram,  ruled  briefly and ",
  "battled  incessantly with  the Mughal army. When  Rajaram  died  in ",
  "1699,  one of his queens, Tarabai, began to rule in the name of her ",
  "infant  son  Shivaji 11;  but Aurangzeb's  army during this period  con\u00ad",
  "quered Maratha forts one after  another,  keeping Tarabai constantly ",
  "on  the move.  From  late  1705,  however, the  tide  began  to  turn ",
  "against Aurangzeb and when he died in 1707 after forty years of futile ",
  "warfare in the Deccan, the Marathas still remained to be subjugated. ",
  "The Maratha kingdom was, however, certainly weakened and the ",
  "process was further exacerbated  after the release of Shahu,  Shivaji's ",
  "grandson,  from the Mughal  prison in  1707.  There  were  now  two ",
  "rival  contenders for  the  throne and  during  the  next  eight  years, ",
  "Maharashtra  was  immersed  in  a  full-scale  civil  war  between  the ",
  "forces of Shahu and those of Tarabai,  who  intended  to rule  in the ",
  "name of Shivaji II. The loyalty of the Maratha sardars and deshmukhs ",
  "shifted  constantly between the  two Maratha factions and  the Mu\u00ad",
  "ghals, the situation  of anarchy  becoming  all-pervasive  by  1712-13. ",

  "establish  a puppet  emperor  in Delhi,  Balaji  Viswanath  secured  for ",
  "his  master  a  Mughal  sanad  (imperial  order)  recognising  Shahu 's ",
  "right  to chauth  and sardeshmukhi  (o ne-fourth  and  one-tenth  respec\u00ad",

  "Deccan,  chauth  of Malwa  and  Gujarat  and  an independent  status  in ",
  "Maharashtra.  The contest  with the Tarabai  faction  was settled  later ",
  "in the Treaty  of Wama  in  1731,  which  gave the state of Kolapur  to ",
  "Shivaji  II. ",
  "Although  Mararha  civil  war was brought  to an end,  the control of ",
  "the  state  gradually  pa  sed  on  from  the  line of  Shivaji  to  that  of  the ",
  "peshwas.  Since the time of Balaji Viswanath,  the office of the peshwa ",
  "became  rapidly  powerful  and the  fountainhead  of authority  and  the ",
  "source  of  all  patronage  in the  entire  Mararha  kingdom.  He died  in ",
  "1720  and  was  succeeded  by his son  Baji  Rao,  who was  in power  till ",
  "17 40.  By then the Maratha  state  had acquired  control  over  large  ter\u00ad",
  "ritories  of the  Mughal  empire,  and  their  only  major  adversary  was ",
  "the Nizam  of Hyderabad,  as both  vied  for control  over  Karnataka, ",
  "Khandesh  and  Gujarat.  In  the  first  round  of  battle,  the  Marathas ",
  "were  defeated;  but  this was soon  avenged  in a resounding  Maratha ",
  "victory  at  Palkhed  (March  1728),  forcing  the  nizam  to  recognise ",
  "Shahu  as  the  sole  Maratha  monarch  with  rights  to  chauth  and ",
  "sardeshmukhi  of the  Deccan  After  that  Baji Rao  led  military  cam\u00ad",
  "paigns  and  acquired  the fertile  lands  of Malwa,  reaching  Rajasthan ",
  "by 1729.39  Meanwhile  in Gujarat,  Mararha  bands  collected  taxes  in ",
  "the countryside,  while  the Mughals  controlled  only  the  cities'? and ",
  "the  once  lucrative  trade  in the  port  of  Surat  now  declined  rapidly ",
  "under  this political  pressure.\" ",
  "When  Baji  Rao  sent  a large  Maratha  army  to  Gujarat  under  his ",
  "brother,  the Mughal  governor  concluded  two  treaties  in  1727 and ",
  "1728,  in  effect  ceding  60  per  cent  of  the  revenues  of  Gujarat  to ",
  "Shahu  and  his peshwa. The  nizam  made  another  attempt  to  humble ",
  "the  peshwa  by allying  with  some  rival Maratha  factions  in Gujarat ",
  "( Gaikwad,  Dabhade  and  Kadam  Bande );  but  their  combined  forces ",
  "were finally  defeated  by the peshwa's  army in 1731.  Some  time  later ",
  "Baji  Rae's  attention  was  directed  towards  the  coastal  plains  of ",
  "Konkan,  where  by  1736  he gained  control  over  the territories  of the ",
  "Sidis  (Abyssinian  Muslims)  and  drove  the Portuguese  out  of Salsette, ",
  "Bassein  and  Chaul.  Then  again he returned  to the north  and  in 1737 ",

  "of nizam  and  the  treaty of Bhopal  that  followed  in January  1739 ",
  "ceded to the peshwa the subah of Malwa and sovereignty  over all ",
  "lands between the rivers Narmada and Chambal. In these territories, ",
  "however, the Marathasdid not try to overturn the local power struc\u00ad",
  "ture and quickly entered into negotiations  with the local zamindars ",
  "for the  payment  of yearly tributes. A civilian  system  of revenue ",
  "administration  took time to emerge in this newly conquered region ",
  "and this was a feature typical of all Maratha conquests. ",
  "After  the  death  of  Baji  Rao in  1740,  Shahu  appointed his son ",
  "Balaji  Bajirao, better known as Nana Saheb (1740-61 ), in his place. ",
  "More  experienced in administration  than  in military campaigns,42 ",
  "he was,  however,  the  most  successful  among the  peshwas.  Nana ",
  "Saheb became the supreme authority in the Maratha polity after the ",
  "death ofShahu in 1749. This was indeed the peak period ofMaratha ",
  "glory when all parts of India had to face Maratha depredations. In ",
  "the east, from 1745 onwards Maratha bands under Raghuji Bhonsle ",
  "of Nagpur  regularly raided  Orissa,  Bengal  and  Bihar,  then  ruled ",
  "autonomously by Alivardi  Khan.  A treaty in  17 51  stopped these ",
  "raids, as Alivardi surrendered Orissa and agreed to pay Rs.  120,000 ",
  "as annual chauth payment for the three provinces. Near at home, the ",
  "Maratha forces regularly  raided  the nizam's territories in Konkan, ",
  "exacted tributes,  but never succeeded in completely subduing them. ",
  "In the north, by the treaty of Bhalke  in 1751,  Salabutjung, the new ",
  "nizam,  practically  ceded  the  entire  control  of Khandesh.  Further ",
  "north,  the  Maratha  bands  regularly  raided  the  Rajput  kingdoms ",
  "of Jaipur, Bundi,  Kotah  and  Udaipur  and  the  Gond  kingdom  of ",
  "Deogarh. They intervened in their wars of succession, exacted annual ",
  "tributes  from  their  rulers,  but  never tried  to  have any permanent ",
  "conquest  in the region.  In the face of an Afghan invasion overrun\u00ad",
  "ning Lahore and Multan, a treaty in 1752  brought  the Mughal em\u00ad",
  "peror  under  the  protection  of  the  Marathas;  and  a  succession ",
  "dispute in  1753  gave them the opportunity to install their own cho\u00ad",
  "sen candidate on  the Mughal throne. The  Maratha expedition  to ",
  "Punjab was, however, short-lived  and soon a Sikh rebellion  put an ",
  "end to Maratha  authority in this region. In any case, the Mararhas by ",
  "then  had gained mastery over  large  parts of north  India; but there ",
  "was  never  any  attempt  to  establish  an  empire.  It  was  only  in ",
  "Khandesh, Malwa and Gujarat that they tried  to put in place some ",
  "kind of an administration;  their conquest elsewhere would seldom ",
  "go beyond  plunder  and  levying of chauth  and sardeshmukhi. As a ",
  "result, it was difficult to maintain this mastery and soon an Afghan ",
  "invasion under Ahmad Shah Abdali dealt a deadly blow to Mararha ",
  "glory. https://telegram.me/UPSCMaterials https://telegram.me/FreeUPSCMaterials https://telegram.me/MaterialforExam",
  "24  FROM PLASSEY TO PARTITION ",
  "Abdali, though troubled by lack of discipline in his army, was sup\u00ad",
  "ported in this contest by a number of other indigenous forces, like ",
  "the Rohillas and Shuja-ud-daula  of Awadh. In the crucial Third Bat\u00ad",
  "tle of Panipat fought on 14 January 1761,  the Maratha forces under ",
  "Sadasiv Rao Bhao were routed  by Abdali, causing about fifty  thou\u00ad",
  "sand casualties.  This marked  the beginning of the decline of Mara\u00ad",
  "rha power. The peshwa died  within weeks and as the young peshwa ",
  "Madhav Rao tried to gain control of the polity, factionalism among ",
  "the  Maratha  sardars  raised  its  ugly  head.  This  faction  fighting ",
  "increased  further  after  Madhav  Rae's  death  in  1772.  His  uncle ",
  "Raghunath  Rao  seized  power,  but  was  opposed  by a  number  of ",
  "important  Maratha chiefs.  To consolidate  his position,  he  found a ",
  "new ally  in  the English,  then  stationed  in Bombay;  but this took ",
  "Maratha history into an entirely different  trajectory, as the English ",
  "had by then emerged as a new contender for power in the turbulent ",
  "politics  of eighteenth-century India.? ",
  "The Maratha state  could  not  become  an alternative  to  Mughal ",
  "empire  because of its own structure. Its nature was that of a confed\u00ad",
  "eracy where power was shared  among the chiefs or sardars,  like the ",
  "Bhonsles  of  Nagpur,  Gaikwad  of  Baroda,  Holkar  of Indore  or ",
  "Sindhia of Gwalior,  all of whom had made their  fortunes as military ",
  "leaders since the days of Shahu. Parts of the Maratha state had been ",
  "alienated to these military commanders and it was difficult to con\u00ad",
  "trol the  e chiefs, who did not like the peshwa regulating their activi\u00ad",
  "ties. What resulted soon was increasing  factional rivalry among the ",
  "Maratha  sardars and although  there was always a strong centre, the ",
  "composition of the inner circle  of power changed  from generation ",
  "to generation.  At the lower level, as mentioned earlier, there was the ",
  "existence of heritable vatan rights, like those of the village headmen, ",
  "mirasidars and deshrnukhs, which could not be taken away by kings. ",
  "The regional assemblies of vatandars  exercised  political  power and ",
  "resolved disputes at a local level,  thus representing local loyalties as ",
  "opposed to any centralised  concept of kingship. The Maratha state, ",
  "in order to establish its control over the territory and consolidate the ",
  "powerbase  of its new ruling class,  sought  to  peripheralise  the re\u00ad",
  "gional  assemblies in the seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries. ",
  "It  tried  to  replace  the  horizontal  ethos  of \"brotherhood\"  of the ",
  "vatandars with the vertical relationship  of service by generously dis\u00ad",
  "tributing among its clients  temporary and transferable land rights or ",
  "that resembled  Mughal  jagir.  But the old system could not ",
  "saranjam ",
  "be  displaced,  as the new system  of  prebended  lordship,  as Frank ",
  "Perlin  has argued,  often  cut  across the  traditional  hierarchies  of https://telegram.me/UPSCMaterials https://telegram.me/FreeUPSCMaterials https://telegram.me/MaterialforExam",
  "25 ",
  "TRANsmoN  OF THE EIGHTEENTH  CENTURY ",
  "status.  So the same locally powerful  Brahman or Maratha  individu\u00ad",
  "als now enjoyed a \"bundle\"  of different kinds of rights. Local loyal\u00ad",
  "ties  and  centralised  kingship  thus  continued  to  exist  in  Deccan ",
  "through  a continuous  process of adjustment  and balancing.\" ",
  "There  is a significant  debate  about  the  relationship  between  the ",
  "Maratha  state and the Mughal system, as some historians  emphasise ",
  "its rebel nature. lrfan Habib (1963) thinks that it was the outcome of ",
  "a zamindar  revolt against an oppressive Mughal bureaucracy. Satish ",
  "Chandra  (1993) has argued about its regional  nature;  although  Baji ",
  "Rao made a move towards  north  India,  his major  aim was only to ",
  "establish  supremacy  in  the  Deccan.  In  other words,  the  Maratha ",
  "state  is often  seen  as a departure  from  the Mughal  tradition.  But ",
  "some other historians  like Andre Wink have argued  that the  Mara\u00ad",
  "thas were also very much within  the Mughal  tradition,  as they had ",
  "built their power on the notion  of sedition  or [itua (the Deccani cor\u00ad",
  "ruption  of the word fitna),  which the Mughal state always provided ",
  "a space for. There  was no \"rebellion\"  as such, as \"concurrent  rights ",
  "constituted  sovereignty\".\"  Even  in  the  1770s  the  Marathas ",
  "acknowledged  the symbolic authority  ofthe Mughal emperor  and in ",
  "Malwa, Khandesh and parts of Gujarat, where they established some ",
  "sort of administration,  it looked very much like the Mughal system. ",
  "The  old terminology  was retained  and  even the differential  urban ",
  "tax rates continued  to favour the Muslims. The only difference was ",
  "that in the Maratha  territories  there were many civilian revenue col\u00ad",
  "lectors,  mainly Brahmans,  who  did  not  move on  to  military  com\u00ad",
  "mand, as was the custom in the Mughal system where there was only ",
  "one  unified  civilian/military  bureaucracy.46  Other  than  this,  the ",
  "Mughal  tradition  remained  central  to social and political  life of the ",
  "Maratha  state system,  although,  as we have noted  earlier,  it had to ",
  "contend  continually  with  local loyalties. Existing  political  conflicts ",
  "between  warrior  families were  resolved  through  a combination  of ",
  "coercion  and conciliation,  the deshmukhs  remaining  the co-sharers ",
  "in the polity  and  rights  being granted  for building  kingdoms.  The ",
  "Maratha  state ultimately declined not so much because of factional\u00ad",
  "ism,  but  because  of the  increasing  power  of the  English  in  the ",
  "Deccan. It was difficult for the Marathas  to resist this efficient army. ",
  "Turning to north  India in the eighteenth  century, we find that the ",
  "history of the Sikh Panth in Punjab was as old as that of the Mughal ",
  "empire. When  Guru Nanak,  born in 1469, began to preach his mes\u00ad",
  "sage of inner devotion  and equality among all human  beings, Babur ",
  "was founding  the Mughal  empire. Within  the bhakti  cir sant  tradi\u00ad",

  "its  shape  and  definition  under  the  leadership  of  the  subsequent ",
  "gurus ... 7  Aurangzeb  was initially  not  very  hostile  to the  Sikhs;  but ",
  "as the community  grew in size and  challenged  the central author\u00ad",
  "ity  of the  Mughals,  the  emperor  turned  against  them  and  Guru ",
  "Tegbahadur, the ninth  in line, was executed in Delhi in 1675. ",
  "The tenth  guru,  Guru  Gobind  Singh,  took an important step  in ",
  "1699;  he  transformed  the  Sikhs  into  a  military  organisation  by ",
  "establishing  the brotherhood  of Khalsa.  It was a ceremony in which ",
  "the guru himself  (and not his deputies or masands)  initiated  the dis\u00ad",
  "ciples,  who were obliged to maintain five distinctive insignia-includ\u00ad",
  "ing  unkempt  hair  and  carrying  of weapons-that  would  publicly ",
  "proclaim  their  identity.  Why he did it is a matter  of conjecture.  One ",
  "reason possibly was the continuing  conflict with the Mughals, which ",
  "had  convinced  the  gurus,  first  Guru  Hargobind  and  then  Guru ",
  "Go bind  Singh,  about  the  necessity  of  armed  resistance  for  the ",
  "defence of the Panth ... 8 It was also probably because of the rise of the ",
  "jat peasantry among  the  Sikhs,  as carrying arms and  resolving dis\u00ad",
  "putes through the use of arms were already part  of j at cultural  tra\u00ad",
  "dition  and  to which  the  other  components  of the  Sikh community, ",
  "the Khatri  traders,  were not perhaps very averse to.,.9 The founding ",
  "of  the  Khalsa  projected  the  Sikh  community  as a  militant  outfit, ",
  "although all Sikhs were not necessarily its members. The Jat peasants ",
  "continued to dominate the Khalsa at the expense of the older  Khatri ",
  "leadership.  Their  aspiration  for equality was further  fulfilled  when ",
  "Guru  Gobind  Singh decided  to terminate the position  of guru after ",
  "his death;  the power of the guru henceforth  was to be vested in the ",
  "Panrh  and  the  Grant h  (s acred  texts).  Thus,  by  invoking  cultural ",
  "resources,  such  as the sacred  texts,  and  prescribing  initiation  and ",
  "other life-cycle rituals  the Khalsa sought to provide order in the life ",
  "of the Sikhs  in otherwise  uncertain  days  of the eighteenth  century, ",
  "and in this way tried to construct  a distinctive Sikh social and politi\u00ad",
  "cal identity. so ",
  "Guru Gobind's open quarrel with the Mughals followed a complex ",
  "trajectory.  From about  1696 he tried  to carve out an autonomous ",
  "domain  in  and  around  Anandpur,  which  brought  the  hostility  of ",
  "the  hill chiefs  of Himachal  Pradesh,  who  approached the Mughal ",
  "faujdar for protection.  The siege of Anandpur  by a combined  force ",
  "in 1704  compelled  Guru Gobind to leave; but Aurangzeb, then busy ",
  "in  Deccan,  soon  reversed  the stand  and  sought  to conciliate  the ",
  "guru. After Aurangzeb's death,  Guru  Gobind  met Bahadur Shah at ",
  "Agra in  1707  and he promised  to return Anandpur.  However,  the ",
  "new emperor  had  to appease the hill chiefs as well, and therefore ",
  "continued  to  postpone  his  final  decision.  In  the  meanwhile,  on https://telegram.me/UPSCMaterials https://telegram.me/FreeUPSCMaterials https://telegram.me/MaterialforExam",

  "7 October 1708,  Guru Gobind was murdered  in a conspiracy,\"  and ",
  "his mantle  then  fell on one  of his followers,  Banda Bahadur, who ",
  "continued  the Sikh revolt. The  stage of the contest  now  shifted to ",
  "Maj ha (between the rivers Beas and Ravi) and Doab (between rivers ",
  "Beas and Sudej) regions, where lived mainly the Jat peasants. MughaT ",
  "oppression around  this time put tremendous pressure on the small ",
  "zamindars  and peasants. Not all of them, it is true, supported Banda ",
  "Bahadur, whose main supporters were the small mulguzari zarnin\u00ad",
  "dars of the jar community. Within  a year a large area between  the ",
  "rivers jamuna  and  Ravi  came  under his  influence  and  here  he ",
  "promptly  established  his  own  administration,  appointed  his  own ",
  "faujdars, diwan and  kardars,  minted  a new  coin  and used  his own ",
  "seal for issuing orders.s2 ",
  "In 1710,  Bahadur  Shah proceeded to Punjab, but  failed  to crush ",
  "the Sikh revolt. When Farruksiyar ascended the throne in 1713,  he ",
  "appointed Abdus Samad Khan the  faujdar of Lahore and gave him ",
  "special  orders to  put an end  to  the  Sikh upsurge. The position  of ",
  "Banda Bahadur had also weakened  by then to some extent, because ",
  "of internal dissension within  the Sikh community. Although in gen\u00ad",
  "eral the j at peasants supported him, some of the J at zamindars  went ",
  "to the Mughal  side, Churaman Jat of Agra being a major  example. ",
  "The Khatri  business class from around  1710 also went  against the ",
  "Sikh movement,  as political  stability  and  security  of  trade  routes ",
  "were essential to the smooth running of their business. At the same ",
  "rime, when  the Mughals introduced  the ijaradari system in Punjab ",
  "for collecting land revenue, many of the Khatri traders became reve\u00ad",
  "nue  farmers and this naturally  linked  their  interests to those of the ",
  "Mughal  state. The emperors  also  tried  to  take  advantage  of this ",
  "internal  dissension  within  the Punjab society, as during the time of ",
  "Jahandar Shah and Farruksiyar, many Khatris were given high posi\u00ad",
  "tions  within  the  Mughal  nobility.  Farruksiyar  tried  to  use  Guru ",
  "Gobind's  widow  to drive a wedge  between  Banda  and  his Sikh  fol\u00ad",
  "lowers. This did not necessarily weaken  Banda's movement,  as op\u00ad",
  "pressive Khatri ijaradars often drove desperate Jat peasants into the ",
  "rebel's camp.  But ultimately  in  1715  Banda  had  to  surrender  to ",
  "Abdus Samad  Khan. He was taken to Delhi along with some of his ",
  "close followers; in March  1716 all of them were executed. ",
  "The  execution  of Banda did  not mean the end of Sikh power in ",
  "Punjab, although  there was no one immediately available  to take up ",
  "the leadership. But even in spite of the absence of a centralised  lead\u00ad",
  "ership, roving bands of Sikh rebels took advantage of the breakdown ",
  "of imperial  control  in  north  India  to  assert  their  independence, https://telegram.me/UPSCMaterials https://telegram.me/FreeUPSCMaterials https://telegram.me/MaterialforExam",
  "28  FROM  PLASSEY TO PARTITION ",
  "despite  the  best efforts of Zakaria  Khan  who  had  succeeded  his ",
  "father Abdus Samad  Khan as the Mughal governor of Lahore. Even ",
  "the Afghan invader Ahmad Shah Abdali failed to bring Punjab under ",
  "his command;  his governors  were soon thrown out and by Septem\u00ad",
  "ber 1761  the  Sikhs  came to  control wide  regions of Punjab  from ",
  "rivers  Surlej  to Indus. Abdali  himself came to Punjab  in 1765,  but ",
  "retired  oon to Kabul without  fighting a single battle. The Sikhs once ",
  "again establi hed their political  power in Punjab once Abdali retired ",
  "from the  Indian scene.  But at  this stage, power in the  Sikh polity ",
  "became  more  horizontally  structured,  as misls,  or  combinations ",
  "based on kinship ties, now held territories as units. Whenever a misl ",
  "conquered  new  territory,  it was distributed  among  its  members ",
  "according  to  the  nature  of contribution made  by  each  member ",
  "towards the conquest. The highest share  obviously went to the chief, ",
  "but even the lowest  soldier got his own patti or a portion  of land, ",
  "which he could  enjoy  as a co-sharer  with  absolute  freedom.\"  The ",
  "number  of misls  thus holding  territories  in  1770  was more  than ",
  "sixty. Above them was the Dal Khalsa with a chosen leader. The misls ",
  "did  unite  on  occasions,  as they  did  in  1765  against  the Afghans.\" ",
  "But on the whole, political  authority in Punjab remained  decentral\u00ad",
  "ised and more horizontally  dispersed  during this whole  period  until ",
  "Ranjir Singh,  the chief of the Sukerchakia misl, tried to raise a more ",
  "centralised Sikh state  at the end of the eighteenth  century. ",
  "After repelling the third Afghan invasion under Abdali's successor ",
  "Zaman Shah in  1798-99,  Ranjit Singh emerged  as one of the out\u00ad",
  "standing  Sikh chiefs and conquered Lahore.  Leading an army with ",
  "improved  artillery  and  infantry  trained by  European  officers,  by ",
  "1809  he had brought under his control large areas in the five doabs ",
  "of Punjab. By the Treaty of Amritsar in that year the English recog\u00ad",
  "nised  him  as the sole sovereign ruler of Punjab. This gave him  the ",
  "opportunity  to round his conquests off by ousting the Afghans  from ",
  "Multan  and  Kashmir  and  subduing  most of the  other  Sikh chiefs, ",
  "many of whom were reduced to the status of tribute-paying vassals. ",
  "By the time of his death, his authority  was recognised in territories ",
  "between the river Surlej and the mountain ranges of Ladakh,  Kara\u00ad",
  "koram, Hindukush  and Sulaiman. ",
  "Although  Mughal and Afghan rules were displaced  from Punjab, ",
  "the new administration  which Ranjit Singh or the  other  Sikh rulers ",
  "before him had introduced remained, like the Maratha  polity, a care\u00ad",
  "ful mix between the Mughal system and local traditions. Continuity ",
  "of Mughal insritutions  was remarkable in the organisation of admin\u00ad",
  "istrative divisions, in the nomenclature of officials, as well as in the https://telegram.me/UPSCMaterials https://telegram.me/FreeUPSCMaterials https://telegram.me/MaterialforExam",
  "29 ",
  "TRANSITION  OF THE  EIGHTEENTH  CENTURY ",
  "tax  collection  system.  Trade  and  commerce  flourished  in Punjab ",
  "because a powerful state under Ranjit Singh provided safe passage to ",
  "traders and their caravans; but still land revenue  remained the main ",
  "source of income for the state. And although the amount ofland rev\u00ad",
  "enue collection increased,  about  40 per cent of it was alienated  as ",
  "jagir.ss  While in the rest of the territories land revenue was directly ",
  "collected  through  kardars,  this penetration  of the state  stopped  at ",
  "the village level and did not infringe upon the power of the clans and ",
  "their chiefs. Local traditional  hierarchies and the concept of a cen\u00ad",
  "tralised monarchical state thus existed  in a delicately balanced  rela\u00ad",
  "tionship,  or in other words, in the dualism  between 'national'  and ",
  "'local'  systems  of governance. This process of incorporation  and ",
  "adjustment as a part of the construction  of a monarchical state could ",
  "be seen at the cultural level as well, where the Khalsa attempt  to con\u00ad",
  "struct  an  exclusive Sikh identity  gradually  incorporated the  non\u00ad",
  "Khalsa Sikhs or the sahajdharis as well.56 At the central level of dur\u00ad",
  "bar politics also Ranjit Singh  maintained  a careful  balance between ",
  "the powerful  Sikh chiefs on the one hand and on the other  freshly ",
  "recruited military commanders from among the peasants of central ",
  "Punjab and the non-Punjabi nobles, such as the Dogra Rajputs from ",
  "jammu.\"  This delicate balancing game functioned well until Ranjit ",
  "Singh's  death  in 1839.  Within a decade  of his death  independent ",
  "Sikh rule disappeared from Punjab, as struggle for power among the ",
  "mighty Sikh chiefs and the royal family feuds helped the English to ",
  "take over  without  much  difficulty-a story we will return to in a ",
  "short while. ",
  "In the eighteenth  century, a few smaller  states,  apart  from  the ",
  "larger powers described earlier, had also emerged in north  India by ",
  "taking advantage  of the weakness of the Mughal  empire.  The Jat ",
  "kingdom ofBharatpur is an important example of this. The Jats were ",
  "an  agriculturist  and  pastoral  caste  inhabiting  the  Delhi-Mathura ",
  "region. Caste affinity with their zamindars brought solidarity within ",
  "the community  and they began  to  revolt  against the Mughal  state ",
  "from the  time of J ahangir. The first revolt  of the J at peasants took ",
  "place in 1669 and the emperor  himself had to proceed  to suppress ",
  "this rebellion. In 1686 the jars revolted again; this time the Mughal ",
  "imperial commander  Bishen Singh Kachhwa achieved some success ",
  "against them,  but failed to curb their power completely. In this way, ",
  "first the local zamindar  Gokla and then Rajaram and Churaman  J at ",
  "used the discontent of their peasants against the Mughal  state and ",
  "founded  the Jat kingdom  at Bharatpur.  It was Suraj Mal who con\u00ad",
  "solidated  Jat  power  during  his reign  (1756--63),  compelling  the https://telegram.me/UPSCMaterials https://telegram.me/FreeUPSCMaterials https://telegram.me/MaterialforExam",

  "FROM PLASSEY TO PARTITION ",
  "Mughal authorities  to recognise him. He successfully withstood  a ",
  "siege by Abdali's army and supported the Marathas in the Third Bat\u00ad",
  "tle of Panipat.  However, as for the organisation  of this rebel  polity, ",
  "the Jat state, although founded with the active support of the peas\u00ad",
  "ants,  continued  to  retain  its  feudal  character.  The  state  had  to ",
  "depend on the zamindars  who held both administrative and revenue ",
  "powers  and  their  revenue  demands sometimes  were even  higher ",
  "than those under the Mughal system. Suraj Mal in the 1750s tried to ",
  "reduce this dependence on the overmighty kinsmen and members of ",
  "his caste, began to drive them off from positions of power, tried  to ",
  "raise an army with foreigners and introduced  the Mughal system of ",
  "revenue collection.\"  But this effort at centralisation  of power ended ",
  "with his death  in 1763,  which was followed by a virtual  collapse of ",
  "the J at state that stretched at one stage from the Ganga in the east to ",
  "Agra  in  the west and  from  Delhi  in  the  north to  Chambal  in the ",
  "south. ",
  "A couple of small Afghan kingdoms were also established in north ",
  "India  following the weakening of the Mughal empire. The Afghans, ",
  "who  started  migrating  to  India  from  the  fifteenth  century,  were ",
  "bands  of roving  warlords,  who  continually moved  from  camp  to ",
  "camp.  During the early phase of Afghan state formation  in India in ",
  "the fifteenth-sixteenth century, the Lodi Sultanate remained only \"a ",
  "pastoral confederation  of tribal lords\". In the mid-sixteenth century, ",
  "Sher  Shah Suri during his rule in Delhi (l5  4D-45), transformed this ",
  "horizontal structure of Afghan  polity  into  a  vertical  relationship ",
  "based on military  service  and direct loyalty to the king. Thus tribal ",
  "principles  of equality and inherited  rights  were replaced  with  the ",
  "concept of centralised power, subordination and royal prerogatives. ",
  "But Sher Shah's rule did not last long and the Afghans continued to ",
  "operate as a fluid ethnic group of mercenary soldiers in the military ",
  "labour  market  of north lndia.59  In the eighteenth century, Afghan ",
  "migration  to India increased because of political instability and eco\u00ad",
  "nomic dislocations  in Afghanistan. The  breakdown of authority  in ",
  "north  India that followed Nadir Shah's invasion gave opportunity to ",
  "another Afghan  leader,  Ali Muhammad  Khan,  to establish  a petty ",
  "kingdom  of Rohilkhand  at the  foothills of the  Himalayas.  But the ",
  "new  kingdom  acquired  hardly any influence  at all,  as it suffered ",
  "heavily at the hands of the neighbouring  powers, like the Marathas, ",
  "jars,  Awadh  and  later  the  English.  Another  independent  Afghan ",
  "kingdom  to the east  of Delhi  in the area  around  Farukhabad  was ",
  "established by Ahmad Khan Bangash. Both the Rohillas and Bangash ",

  "TRANSITION OF THE EIGHTEENlli  CENTURY ",
  "their power declined  quickly  as Abdali  retired  from  the Indian  stage ",
  "leaving  Najib-ud-daula  in charge  of affairs  at Delhi. ",
  "Apart  from  the  successor  states  and  the  rebel  states,  which  came ",
  "into existence  following  the weakening  ofthe Mughal  empire,  there ",
  "were  also a few principalities,  like the Rajput  kingdoms,  Mysore  or ",
  "Travancore,  which  already  enjoyed  considerable  amount  of auton\u00ad",
  "omy  in  the  past  and now  in  the  eighteenth  century  became  com\u00ad",
  "pletely  independent.  In  the  medieval  period  a  number  of  roving ",
  "warrior groups  thrived  in the- north  Indian  military  labour market, ",
  "from  where  the Mughal  army  recruited  its soldiers.  Gradually  pro\u00ad",
  "fessional  specialisation  was  offering  these  people  ethnic  identities, ",
  "Rajput  being  one  of them,  as social  mobility  from  peasant  to  Raj\u00ad",
  "put  became  a  frequent  occurrence  during  this  period. s?  It was  by ",
  "sixteenth-seventeenth  century  that the Rajputs  came  to be organised ",
  "into  about twenty  major  clans,  with  their  chiefs  gradually  establish\u00ad",
  "ing their centralised  control  over  territory,  with  the patronage of the ",
  "Mughal  emperors  following  a policy  of indirect  rule.  Since  the time ",
  "of Akbar,  different  Rajput  chiefs  were  being  incorporated  into the ",
  "Mughal  structure  as peshkashi  zamindars.  They paid  an annuaJ  trib\u00ad",
  "ute  (peshkash)  to the Mughal  emperor  as a mark  of subordination, ",
  "and enjoyed  autonomy  in matters  of internal  administration.  Many ",
  "of them  were  also given high military  ranks  within  the Mughal  army ",
  "and  contributed  to the  strength  of the  empire,  and  in  return  were ",
  "given  help  in their  effort to consolidate  their  own  control over  their ",
  "kingdoms.  Thus  as many  of the Rajput  chiefs  sought  to claim  cen\u00ad",
  "tralised  authority  in their  territories,  this  significantly  affected  the ",
  "power relations  within  the Rajput  states  based  on  land  ownership. ",
  "Previously,  entitlement  to land  depended  on inherited  rights  given ",
  "by the brotherhood  of the clan  or marriage  relations.  But now  grad\u00ad",
  "ually  this  relationship  of  \"corporate  egalitarianism\",  as  Norman ",
  "Zieglar  calls it, was replaced  by the hierarchical  principles  of service ",
  "and  loyalty  that  entitled  clients  to  pattas  on  land.61  However,  the ",
  "displacement  was never complete,  as the chiefs and their centralising ",
  "policies  were  continually  challenged  by  local  groups  or junior  lin\u00ad",
  "eages from  within  the clans. When someone  rebelled,  he was helped ",
  "by  his  own  immediate  kinsmen  and  their  marriage  alliances;  but ",
  "rebels  when  unsuccessful  were  usually  accommodated  within  the ",
  "polity  and therefore  rebellion  happened  to be an accepted  norm of ",
  "political  behaviour.  Even in the early  nineteenth century,  in a Rajput ",
  "polity  like  Sirohi,  the darbar remained  \"a synthesis  of the  powers  of ",
  "the sovereign  and the  nobles\",  and \"there was not a single  noble  ... ",
  "whose  lineage  had not rebelled\"  in the recent or distant  past against ",
  "the incumbent  ruler. 62 https://telegram.me/UPSCMaterials https://telegram.me/FreeUPSCMaterials https://telegram.me/MaterialforExam",
  "32 ",
  "FROM PLASSEY TO PARmlON ",
  "To put it in another  way,  Rajput polities,  to quote Norbad Pea\u00ad",
  "body, \"were built on webs of criss-crossing,  non-exclusive political ",
  "relationships  that  produced  state  formations  chat  were  neither ",
  "founded on the basis of territorial  integrity nor absolute and exclu\u00ad",
  "sive political loyalties. \"63  And it was within  this complex  matrix  of ",
  "local  loyalties,  centralising  kingship  and  clan  rivalries  that  the ",
  "Rajputs  placed their  relationship  with  the Mughals.  In the  seven\u00ad",
  "teenth century during  the time  of Aurangzeb the harmonious rela\u00ad",
  "tionship  between the two seemed to break down,  though,  contrary ",
  "to popular  historical myths, this was not because  of religious  reac\u00ad",
  "tions or Rajput  nationalism.  Aurangzeb did not discriminate  against ",
  "the  Rajput sardars  in matters  of recruitment;  but he could  hardly ",
  "tolerate  the continuous territorial expansion  of Mewar under  Raj ",
  "Singh at the expense of other Rajput chieftains, as this would contra\u00ad",
  "vene the traditional  Mughal policy of balance  of power. So to con\u00ad",
  "tain him; he began to patronise other neighbouring  Rajput sardars. ",
  "The situation actually began to take an ugly tum  when he interfered ",
  "in  the  succession  question  of Marwar.  After  the  death  of  Rana ",
  "jaswant Singh,  a son was born  to Rani Hari,  but Aurangzeb refused ",
  "to recognise him as the new Rana and instead  put up Inder Singh as ",
  "his  own  candidate  for  the  position.  Such  interference  was  not ",
  "unprecedented,  as in the past  the Mughal  emperors  had used clan ",
  "rivalries  and  exerted  their  right  to  appoint  successors  to  Rajput ",
  "states. And now, particularly as Marwar was situated  in the strategic ",
  "route between Agra and Ahmedabad,  it could not be left in charge of ",
  "a child ruler. The question of religious difference did not arise, as the ",
  "Maharani was prepared to accept Sharia and pay a higher peshkash ",
  "if her son Ajit Singh's  claim was recognised.  But when this did not ",
  "happen,  the Rather sardars,  ably helped  by Mewar, rose in  revolt ",
  "against the Mughal  empire.\" ",
  "Mewar's  assistance to the warring  chiefs ofMarwar was to estab\u00ad",
  "lish  its pre-eminence  in Rajpur politics and not so much to further ",
  "Rajput nationalism,  as Satish Chandra  has shown. The other Rajput ",
  "clans, like the Kachchwas, Haras, Bhartis and the Rathors ofBekanir, ",
  "did  not participate  in this revolt  of 1680-81; some of them  even ",
  "supported  the Mughals.  Indeed, the movement soon dissipated due ",
  "to internal rivalries among the Rajput sardars, each crying to consoli\u00ad",
  "date or expand  territorial  control  at the expense of other clans. 65 In ",
  "the eighteenth century many of them began to assert their independ\u00ad",
  "ence  vis-a-vis  the  Mughal  empire-their  method  was  to slowly ",
  "loosen  their  ties with  Delhi and  function  as independent  states  in ",
  "practice. The most powerful of the Rajput chiefs during this period ",

  "increase from  the  late  seventeenth  century  under  Chikkadevaraja ",
  "Wodeyar (1672-1704 ),66  but it reached its real period of glory under ",
  "Haidar Ali. A man of humble origin, Haidar had started his career as ",
  "a junior  officer in the Mysore army and gradually  rose to  promi\u00ad",
  "nence. By 1761  he took over political power in Mysore by ousting ",
  "the corrupt dalu/ai (prime  minister)  Nanjraj, who had in the mean\u00ad",
  "while  usurped real power in the kingdom by reducing the W odeyar ",
  "king into a mere titular head. ",
  "Haidar  modernised  his army with French experts, who trained an ",
  "efficient  infantry and artillery and infused European discipline  into ",
  "the Mysore army. It was organised on a European model through the ",
  "system of risalas,  with  a clear chain  of command  going up to the ",
  "ruler. Each risala had a fixed number  of soldiers, with provision for ",
  "weaponry  and  modes of  transport  and  a  commander  appointed ",
  "directly by Haidar himself His power was further  consolidated  by ",
  "the subjugation of the local warrior chiefs  or hereditary  overlords ",
  "like deshmukhs and paleg  ars (poligars ), who had until then complete ",
  "mastery over the countryside through their control over agricultural ",
  "surpluses and  local  temples.  Haidar, and  later his son Tipu  Sultan, ",
  "introduced  the system of imposing land  taxes directly on the peas\u00ad",
  "ants and collecting them through salaried officials  and in cash,  thus ",
  "enhancing enormously  the resource base of the state. This land reve\u00ad",
  "nue system was based on detailed survey and classification of land; ",
  "sometimes fixed rents and sometimes a share of the produce  were ",
  "collected from different categories ofland, such as wet or dry lands, ",
  "the rate of rent varying according to the productivity of soil.  It did ",
  "not  completely  dispense  with  the Mughal  institution  of jagir,  but ",
  "restricted it to a very small proportion of the available land.67 Burton ",
  "Stein has called Tipu's revenue system a form of \"military fiscalism\", ",
  "where  taxes were collected  from a wide base directly by state  offi\u00ad",
  "cials  in order to mobilise resources to build up and maintain a large ",
  "army. This was therefore part of a poliricaJ project to establish  cen\u00ad",
  "tralised military  hegemony  by eliminating  the intermediaries  who https://telegram.me/UPSCMaterials https://telegram.me/FreeUPSCMaterials https://telegram.me/MaterialforExam",
  "34  FROM PLASSEY TO PARTITION ",
  "were co-sharers  of power  in a previous segmentary  state  under  the ",
  "Vijaynagara  empire. 68 ",
  "Tipu's state in order  to expand its resource base provided encour\u00ad",
  "agement  for the  development of agriculture, such  as tax remission ",
  "for reclamation  of wasteland, and tried to protect the peasants  from ",
  "the rapacity of tax collectors.  Even his arch enemies had to concede ",
  "that \"his country was the best cultivated and its population  the most ",
  "flourishing  in India\" .69  Tipu was also interested  in  modernising  the ",
  "agricultural  economy, by repairing  old irrigation  systems and  con\u00ad",
  "structing  new ones,  by promoting agricultural  manufacturing  and ",
  "introducing  sericulrure in Mysore. He sent ambassadors to France to ",
  "bring in European  technology, went on  to build a navy, with ambi\u00ad",
  "tion to participate  in oceanic trade.  He launched in  1793 what can ",
  "be described  as a \"state commercial corporation\",  with plans to set ",
  "up factories outside Mysore. In course of time Mysore state began to ",
  "participate  in a lucrative  trade  in  valuable  goods like sandalwood, ",
  "rice, silk, coconut, sulphur etc. and established thirty trading centres ",
  "in and outside Mysore in other  parts of western  India and overseas ",
  "like  Muscat.  But his  plans of modernisation went  far beyond  his ",
  "resources  and  therefore,  Mysore  remained,  as Irfan  Habib  argues, ",
  "\"far away from a real opening  to modern  civilization\".\" ",
  "The  state  of  Mysore  under  Haidar Ali and  Tipu  Sultan  was ",
  "involved in establishing a centralised military hegemony. Its territo\u00ad",
  "rial  ambitions  and trading  interests got it engaged in a state of con\u00ad",
  "stant warfare,  which  overshadowed  all  other aspects  of its history ",
  "during  this period.  Haidar  Ali had  invaded  and  annexed  Malabar ",
  "and Calicut  in 1766,  thus expanding  the frontiers ofMysore signifi\u00ad",
  "cantly. On  the other  hand,  the boundaries of the Maratha  kingdom ",
  "extended  over  the  coastal  areas  of Konkan  and  Malabar,  which ",
  "made  conflict  with  Mysore  inevitable. There was also conflict with ",
  "the other powers in the region, like Hyderabad  and then the English, ",
  "on whom  Haidar  Ali inflicted a heavy defeat near Madras  in 17 69. ",
  "After  his death  in  1782,  his son Tipu  Sultan  followed  his  father's ",
  "policies.  His rule came to an end with a defeat  at the hands  of the ",
  "English in  1799-he died defending  his capital  Srirangapatnam. We ",
  "shall  return  to that story shortly,  but  before  that it is important  to ",
  "remember  that  in a significant way Tipu's  reign represented  a dis\u00ad",
  "continuity  in  eighteenth  century  Indian  politics,  as  his  kingship, ",
  "argues  Kate  Brittlebank  (1997),  was  rooted  firmly  in  a  strong ",
  "regional  tradition.  Unlike other eighteenth century  states which did ",
  "not challenge  the political legitimacy  of the Mughal emperor, in a ",
  "symbolic  gesture  to  proclaim his  independence,  Tipu  issued coins https://telegram.me/UPSCMaterials https://telegram.me/FreeUPSCMaterials https://telegram.me/MaterialforExam",
  "TRANSITION  OF THE EIGHTEENTH  CENTURY  35 ",
  "without any reference to the Mughal  emperor;  and  instead  of Em\u00ad",
  "peror Shah Alam's name he inserted  his own  name in  the  khurba ",
  "(Friday sermons at the mosques);  finally, he sought a sanad from the ",
  "Ottoman  Khalif to  legitimise  his  rule.  But he  too  \"did  not com\u00ad",
  "pletely sever links\" with the Mughal monarch,  who still commanded ",
  "respect in the subcontinent.  Being a \"realist\" as he was, Tipu recog\u00ad",
  "nised Mughal authority when it suited him and defied it when it did ",
  "nor.?' ",
  "Further  south, the southernmost  state of Travancore  had always ",
  "maintained its independence  from Mughal rule. It gained  in impor\u00ad",
  "tance after 1729 when its king Marranda  Varma started expanding ",
  "his dominions  with the help of a strong  and  modem army trained ",
  "along Western lines and equipped with modem weapons. The Dutch ",
  "were ousted  from the region;  the English were  made to accept his ",
  "terms  of trade;  local  feudal  chiefs  were  suppressed;  and  smaller ",
  "principalities  governed  by collateral  branches of  the  royal  family ",
  "were  taken  over. By the  beginning  of the 1740s,  Varma  had  con\u00ad",
  "structed  a powerful bureaucratic  state, which required  control over ",
  "larger  resources.  He  resolved this problem  by  proclaiming  a royal ",
  "monopoly, first on pepper trade and then on all trade in the prosper\u00ad",
  "ous Malabar  coast.  Some of the profit  that the state earned  in this ",
  "way was ploughed  back into  the community  through development ",
  "of irrigation,  transport  and  communication  systems  and  various ",
  "other charities.\"  In view of recent researches, this measure  in  itself ",
  "does not seem to be a major departure  from existing political  con\u00ad",
  "vention. Although  Travancore was not formally within  the Mughal ",
  "system, \"royal and noble trade\" was becoming an established Mughal ",
  "tradition  since the seventeenth  century. 73 Travancore  withstood the ",
  "shock of a Mysorean invasion  in I 7 66 and under Martanda Varma' s ",
  "successor Rama Varma its capital became a centre of scholarship and ",
  "art. In his death  towards the closing years of the eighteenth  century ",
  "the region lost its former glory and soon succumbed  to British pre ",
  "sure,  accepting  a  Resident  in  1800.  However, the  internal  social ",
  "organisation  of the state, marked by the dominance  of the Nair com\u00ad",
  "munity in administration, landholding and social spheres continued ",
  "for another fifty years, yielding to the forces of change in the second ",
  "half of the nineteenth  century. 74 ",
  "The major characteristic of eighteenth-century  India  was there\u00b7 ",
  "fore the weakening of the centralised Mughal empire and a dispersal ",
  "of political  power  across the regions. There  was in other words, a ",
  "transformation  of the  polity,  rather than complete  collapse. 75  The ",
  "symbols  of  MughaJ authority  were  still  recognised,  the  Mughal https://telegram.me/UPSCMaterials https://telegram.me/FreeUPSCMaterials https://telegram.me/MaterialforExam",
  "36  FROM  PLASSEY TO PARTITION ",
  "system also  continued, although in some areas its content was sub\u00ad",
  "stantially  changed.  Talking  about  Mughal Bengal,  Richard  Eaton ",
  "concludes that \"even while central power in Delhi declined,  render\u00ad",
  "ing  Bengal effectively independent  from the second  decade  of the ",
  "eighteenth century on, the ideological  and bureaucratic structure  of ",
  "Mughal imperialism continued to expand  in the Bengal delta\"  But ",
  ".76 ",
  "although the successor  states continued  Mughal  institutions-and ",
  "perhaps  also inherited  some of their  weaknesses-there  were  also ",
  "indications  of significant  innovation  and  improvement-both  in ",
  "terms  of political  rituals  and  insignia, as also in  perfecting mecha\u00ad",
  "nisms of resource extraction  from agriculture and trade. At a politi\u00ad",
  "cal  level  all  these  states  continually  made  adjustments  between ",
  "concepts  of centralised  kingship  and  local loyalties,  between pre\u00ad",
  "bended  lordship  and  hereditary  rights,  or  in  more  general  terms, ",
  "between centripetal  and centrifugal tendencies.  This political heter\u00ad",
  "ogeneity  also  favoured  the  flourishing  of  a  diverse  cultural  life, ",
  "where religious strife was not a part of ordinary social life-despite ",
  "some tension  between  the Shia and Sunni Muslims  in Awadh-and ",
  "where side by side with orthodoxy, there were also plebeian, syncre\u00ad",
  "tistic and rationalist  schools  of thought,  which were patronised  by ",
  "the  regional  rulers.  Thus  the  devotional  religion  of  Vaishnavism ",
  "flourished  in Bengal,\"  the Firangi Mahal blossomed in Lucknow as ",
  "a rationalist school of Islamic thought?s and even after the decline of ",
  "its main centre  at Bijapur the Deccani Sufi tradition  and its literary ",
  "culture  survived in Hyderabad  and Arcot. 79  If Tipu  Sultan found in ",
  "Islam  an enduring  ideology  of power,  he was equally  patronising ",
  "towards  the Hindu religious  institutions  like the Sringeri Math and ",
  "other Hindu  shrines.\" ",
  "On the economic side the eighteenth  century was not a period of ",
  "total stagnation either, as there had been considerable regional vari\u00ad",
  "ations. Sarish Chandra  (1991)  has talked about  the resilience of the ",
  "economy,  as trade,  both  internal and external,  continued  without ",
  "disruption  and even prospered.  There  was now an expanding com\u00ad",
  "mercial  economy  and  the  revenue  farmers  and  merchants  with ",
  "money power increased their political influence. Indigenous  bankers ",
  "handled considerable amounts of cash and operated  extensive finan\u00ad",
  "cial networks  across the country to transfer  credit  through  hundis. ",
  "And as one theory would have it, they were now supposedly favour\u00ad",
  "ing the  regional elite,  rather  than  the  central  Mughal  authority. ",
  "81 ",
  "There  was,  in  other  words,  \"creation  of  new  wealth  and  social ",
  "power  in the provinces\",  which,  as C.A. Bayly has argued,  resulted ",
  "in  the  decline  of the  centralised  Mughal  power. 82  There  is  one https://telegram.me/UPSCMaterials https://telegram.me/FreeUPSCMaterials https://telegram.me/MaterialforExam",
  "TRANSITION  OF  THE  EIGHTEENTH  CENTURY  3 7 ",
  "significant  point  that  emerges  from  the  recent  historiography  of ",
  "eighteenth-century  India-that  there  were  regions  with  consider\u00ad",
  "able amounts  of resources, which actually attracted  the English and ",
  "other European  traders  and triggered  off a competition  among  them ",
  "for mastery over the subcontinent. ",
  "1.3. ",
  "FOUNDATION  OF THE  BRITISH EMPIRE ",
  "The English East India Company was founded  by a royal charter  on ",
  "31 December  1600,  as a joint stock company of London merchants ",
  "uniting to combat Dutch competition  in Eastern trade. It was given ",
  "monopoly  of all trade  from England to the East and was permitted, ",
  "even in an age dominated  by mercantilist ideas, to carry bullion out ",
  "of the country  to finance  its trade.  It was not,  however, given any ",
  "overt mandate at that time to carry on conquest or colonisation.  The ",
  "Company  formally started  trading  in India from 1613 after settling ",
  "scores with the Portuguese,  who  had arrived  at the scene earlier. A ",
  "[arman  from  Mughal  emperor  Jahangir  gave them  permission  to ",
  "establish  their  factories  or  warehouses  in  India,  the  first  factory ",
  "being set up in Surat in the western coast. In 1617 Jahangir  received ",
  "Sir Thomas  Roe as a resident  English envoy in his court.  This was ",
  "the modest beginning from where the Company gradually extended ",
  "its trading  activities to other  parts  of India,  with Bombay, Calcutta ",
  "and Madras emerging by the end of the seventeenth  century as three ",
  "major  centres  of its activities.  Political expansion  started  from  the ",
  "middle  of the eighteenth  century, and within  hundred  years almost ",
  "the whole of India was under its control. ",
  "P.J. Marshall  (1968) has argued  that  until 1784  (i.e., the passage ",
  "of Pitt's India Act), there was no conscious or consistent British pol\u00ad",
  "icy for  political  conquest  in  India.  Authority  at  home  remained ",
  "divided between  the Court  of Directors  of the East India Company ",
  "and the tenuous  regulatory  power  of the government,  with  no one ",
  "seemingly  interested  in  acquiring  territories  in  India  until  1784, ",
  "although  by then  a large empire  had already  been  acquired.  \"Thus ",
  "the  growth  of territorial  empire  in India\",  argues Marshall,  \"was ",
  "neither  planned  nor directed  from Britain\";\"  it was the initiative of ",
  "the  Company  officials operating  in India which decided  the course ",
  "of action,  despite the absence of any policy directives from London ",
  "in favour of conquest  and colonisation.  Marshall  acknowledged  in ",
  "an earlier  essay that  there was considerable  commercial  expansion ",
  "during  the  early  eighteenth  century  and  the  obvious  connection ",
  "between trade and empire was also hard to ignore. 14 But then, it was ",
  "the  political  fragmentation  and instability  following the  decline  of https://telegram.me/UPSCMaterials https://telegram.me/FreeUPSCMaterials https://telegram.me/MaterialforExam",
  "38  PARmJON ",
  "FROM  PLASSEY TO ",
  "the Mughal  power  that actually facilitated the territorial  expansion ",
  "of the  Company.  Its history,  therefore,  needs  to  be traced  in the ",
  "developments of eighteenth-century  Indian  politics,  where  the Eng\u00ad",
  "lish were  only  \"responding  to  these  developments  and  exploiting ",
  "the  opportunities that  came  their  way\" .1s  In  other  words,  it  was ",
  "developments  in the periphery,  rather than impetus from the metro\u00ad",
  "pole, which thrust  upon the Company  a career of territorial  expan\u00ad",
  "sion  in  India.  And  even  after  the  1780s,  argues  C.A.  Bayly, the ",
  "imperial  expansion  was primarily, motivated  by the  fiscal and  mili\u00ad",
  "tary needs of the Company,  rather  than interests of trade-the  \"free ",
  "traders [being] nothing  more than the fly on the wheel\". 86 ",
  "While it is difficult to deny the importance  of \"sub-imperialism\"87 ",
  "of the men on  the spot  or pressures  generated  at the  periphery  as ",
  "driving forces behind  territorial  conquests, we may also posit here ",
  "some telling evidence of engagement of the metropole  in the project ",
  "of empire building  in India.  There  is, first of all, considerable  evi\u00ad",
  "dence to suggest that from the very beginning use off orce to promote ",
  "trade  was an axiom  in the practices of the East India Company; its ",
  "trade was always armed trade.\" And despite the apparent  separation ",
  "between  the Company  and the state, the two were intimately  inter\u00ad",
  "linked  in  promoting  England's diplomatic  goals, as the  Company ",
  "itself owed its privileges, and indeed very existence,  to royal prerog\u00ad",
  "89 ",
  "ative.  In English politics, the Company's  fortunes suffered reverses ",
  "during  the  time of the  Stuart  monarchs  James  I and  Charles I and ",
  "also during  the  Civil War, when  its privileges came  under  severe ",
  "attack.  But the  situation  began  to  improve  with  the  restoration  of ",
  "Charles II to the throne  of England. To secure wealth and independ\u00ad",
  "ence for the crown,  both  he and his brother  James II followed  an ",
  "aggressive commercial  policy abroad.  In real terms, this involved the ",
  "use of naval  power  in the  Indian  Ocean  and  in the  Indian  coastal ",
  "areas, where  fortified  bases and enclaves in the factory  ports  were ",
  "constructed  as a part of regular  policy, which,  in Philip  Lawson's ",
  "words, may be described as \"the moral economy of English gunnery ",
  "in these local markets\". 90 The English naval guns during this period ",
  "could  not alter the entire trading  pattern  of the East;  but they pre\u00ad",
  "vented  the Indian  rulers  from obstructing  or undermining  English ",
  "trade  in the local markets. ",
  "The relationship  between the Crown and the Company  was mutu\u00ad",
  "ally beneficial.  In 1660  the Company  celebrated  the restoration  of ",
  "the Stuart monarchy  by offering \u00a33,000  worth  of silver plates to His ",
  "Majesty. In 1661 Cromwell's charter  was replaced  by one signed by ",
  "the  king and  in gratitude  the  Company  directors  voted  in 1662 a https://telegram.me/UPSCMaterials https://telegram.me/FreeUPSCMaterials https://telegram.me/MaterialforExam",
  "39 ",
  "TRANSITION  OF THE  EIGHTEENTH  CENTURY ",
  "loan  of \u00a310,000  for the King.  In the subsequent  years  more loans ",
  "totaling \u00a3150,000  were offered  and  more  charters  with additional ",
  "privileges  followed.  \"King  and  Company\",  as  John  Keay  writes, ",
  "\"understood  one  another  well. \"91  The  initial  history  of the Presi\u00ad",
  "dency system in India is also  indicative of Crown's involvement  in ",
  "the colonisation  of the  country. The  island  ertlernent  of Bombay, ",
  "which  Charles  II  received  from  the  Portuguese  crown  in  1661  as ",
  "dowry for his  bride, was handed  over to the East India Company in ",
  "1668 for a token annual  rental of \u00a310 and  it was here that in 1687 ",
  "the  Presidency  headquarters  of  the  west  coast  was  shifted  from ",
  "Surat. What is important to note here is that Bombay had been given ",
  "to Charles through  the Treaty of Whitehall,  which included a secret ",
  "provision  that  it would  be  used  to  protect  the  Portuguese  settle\u00ad",
  "ments in India. It involved a mutual defence pact against the aggres\u00ad",
  "sive and expanding Dutch East India Company, and now even after ",
  "the  handover,  that obligation  to defend  Portuguese  positions was ",
  "happily owned up by the King, and that made the English Company ",
  "directors  immensely grateful, offering a further Joan. n The growth ",
  "of the  Madras Presidency  was also  to  a  large  extent  because  of ",
  "Cromwell's  charter, which provided  encouragement  for the devel\u00ad",
  "opment  of this area. The Calcutta Presidency  developed  later  in the ",
  "eighteenth  century  and the  London  authorities  were involved in a ",
  "major way in its development  and defence.\" But even prior to that, ",
  "in the  1680s  when Aurangzeb  became  busy  in imperial  wars,  seri\u00ad",
  "ously threatening  the stability and security ofEnglish trade, the East ",
  "India Company under  the leadership  of Sir Josiah  Child decided to ",
  "take an aggressive stance in defence of Company's trading  interests. ",
  "Its military weakness at this stage proved disastrous, although,  fortu\u00ad",
  "nately  for  the  Company,  Aurangzeb  did  not  take any  retributive ",
  "action and restored its privileges in return  for an apology and a pay\u00ad",
  "ment  of  compensation.  But  defeat  does  not  hide  the  aggressive ",
  "intent of the  Company, which  \"became  identified  with  a  Stuart ",
  "monarchy pursuing an equally bold and authoritarian imperial pol\u00ad",
  "icy around  the globe.\" In the middle of the eighteenth century  the ",
  "Europeans gained \"a decided  technological  edge\" over the Indians ",
  "and  this paved  the way for victory  of what  has been  described  by ",
  "Philip Lawson as  a \"policy of aggression and state imperialism by ",
  "I ",
  "proxy.?\" ",
  "After James  II was replaced by William and Mary  in 1689,  the ",
  "Company once again came under increasing attack in England. The ",
  "political  ascendancy of the Whigs brought  the  Company's  monop\u00ad",
  "oly rights and corrupt  practices into question  and a rival Company https://telegram.me/UPSCMaterials https://telegram.me/FreeUPSCMaterials https://telegram.me/MaterialforExam",
  "40 ",
  "FROM  PLASSEYTO PARTITION ",
  "was set up. However, the bill authorising the foundation  of the new ",
  "company was passed by the House of Commons  in 1698 only when ",
  "the promoters  of the new company offered a \u00a32 million loan to the ",
  "state, as against the offer of \u00a3700,000 by the old Company  wanting ",
  "a renewal  of its exclusive charter. It became clear by this time that ",
  "the right to trade in the East was \"a marketable  commodity\", and if ",
  "Parliament granted  that right,  it was the state which would  benefit, ",
  "instead of King and the Court. 95 By 1709 the anomalies were sorted ",
  "out, as the two companies merged again and it was widely accepted ",
  "in London how crucial the  financial  role of the Company  was in ",
  "strengthening  the  state  and in improving  its diplomatic  profile  in ",
  "European  politics.  The eighteenth  century  thus  marked  the begin\u00ad",
  "ning  of  self-confident  territorial  expansion  in  India,  as  imperial ",
  "expansion  and  the  financial strength  of the Company  came to be ",
  "integrally connected.\"; It was discussed in the early eighteenth  cen\u00ad",
  "tury not only among the Company  officials, but also widely among ",
  "the London public and in the political circles; the foundation  of the ",
  "Company's empire in India was therefore not entirely without direc\u00ad",
  "tion from London. The relationship between the state and the Com\u00ad",
  "pany was further streamlined in the 1770s, when the latter agreed to ",
  "pay \u00a3400,000 annually to the state exchequer for its Indian territo\u00ad",
  "rial possessions and revenues earned  since 1765, and thus gained an ",
  "official endorsement  of its position in India. By this time the Com\u00ad",
  "pany was being looked  at as \"a powerful engine in the hands of the ",
  "Government  for the  purposes  of drawing  from  a distant country ",
  "the  largest  revenue  it is capable  of yielding.\"  The charters  of the ",
  "Company  were seen  to  be providing  for \"delegated  sovereignty\", ",
  "while the monopoly of trade and territorial  possessions were consid\u00ad",
  "ered to be returns  for the public funds and trust invested  in the joint ",
  "stock company  \"for  the benefit  of the British  nation\".  The Regu\u00ad",
  "lating  Act of 1773  resolved the ambiguities involved in the sover\u00ad",
  "eignty issue,  by establishing the rights of the state  on all territorial ",
  "acquisitions overseaS.97  If later the London  authorities became at all ",
  "averse to territorial  expansion,  it was only because of the expenses ",
  "of wars. They wanted very much to share the resources of an Indian ",
  "empire,  but not the cost of acquiring it or the burden of administer\u00ad",
  "ing it.91 ",
  "The expansion  of the  empire  in India in the second  half of the ",
  "eighteenth century marked,  according to  Cain and A.G. Hopkins, ",
  "P.J. ",
  "an extension  of the \"gentlemanly  capitalism\", upheld  by an alliance ",
  "between landed interests and financial power that was in ascendancy ",
  "in London after 1688; and that was the reason why \"revenue became https://telegram.me/UPSCMaterials https://telegram.me/FreeUPSCMaterials https://telegram.me/MaterialforExam",

  "and remained  the central preoccupation\"  of imperial  policy.\"  Cain ",
  "and  Hopkins  brought  the  merropole  back  into  the  discussion  of ",
  "imperialism,  and it is difficult to deny the importance of Indian reve\u00ad",
  "nue resources for financing England's growing internal and overseas ",
  "trade, and this undoubtedly  created  the impulse for conquest. But in ",
  "eighteenth-century  India there  were  a few other significant  inter\u00ad",
  "ests=-other than revenue and the Company's trade-which were also ",
  "involved in determining  the specific course of territorial  expansion. ",
  "From  the  very  beginning,  the  Company's  monopoly  rights  were ",
  "breached  in various ways and in the eighteenth  century it rose to cri\u00ad",
  "sis proportions. The \"interlopers\" in the seventeenth century directly ",
  "defied the Company's  monopoly rights by conducting and financing ",
  "illegal  trade  between  England  and  the  Indian  Ocean  countries. ",
  "Efforts to curb their power often led to constitutional crises as in the ",
  "Skinner v.  The East India Company  in 1668-69,  when the House of ",
  "Lords actually  upheld the rights of an interloper. 'oo But the problem ",
  "of illegal trade was actually  compounded  by the  Company's  own ",
  "organisation.  Its employees began to involve themselves in the coun\u00ad",
  "try trade in India in order to supplement their meagre salaries.  There ",
  "were also free merchants, who were not in the employment  of the ",
  "Company, but were allowed to settle in its establishments. The Com\u00ad",
  "pany  used to ignore  this trade  and  even encouraged  such  private ",
  "traders, operating in conjunction  with the Indian merchants,  as long ",
  "as they did  not directly  participate in the oceanic trade to and  from ",
  "Europe. ",
  "These two types of parallel  trading activities,  however,  soon came ",
  "into conflict in the second half of the eighteenth  century. Whenever ",
  "the  interests  of the  private  merchants  clashed  with  those of  the ",
  "Company, there was cheating,  deceit  and  a  whole circle  of illicit ",
  "credit  and trading networks, eroding  the profits of the Company. ioa ",
  "Often  there was collusion between the private traders and the inter\u00ad",
  "lopers  and  the profit earned  through  this illicit  trade was remitted ",
  "through  bills of exchange drawn on the London  office of the Com\u00ad",
  "pany or the Amsterdam office of the Dutch Company. In the 1750s ",
  "such  remittances through  only the  English  Company amounted to ",
  "an average of \u00a3100,000  annually,  which was more than sixty times ",
  "of the annual  salary which these officials  earned  in Company's  ser\u00ad",
  "vice. More critical,  however, was the misuse by these private traders ",
  "of the  trading  privileges granted  by the Mughal  authorities  to the ",
  "East India  Company. The dastak or the permits issued  by the local ",
  "councils of the Company  certifying  their goods, which  were to be ",
  "charged  no duty by the Mughal authorities,  were  frequently  issued https://telegram.me/UPSCMaterials https://telegram.me/FreeUPSCMaterials https://telegram.me/MaterialforExam",

  "FROM PLASSEYTO PARTITION ",
  "by the  Company  officials to their  own  Indian agents,  thus  defraud\u00ad",
  "ing  the  Mughal  treasury  of  enormous  amounts  of  revenue.  The ",
  "Court of Directors  tried to stop this malpractice,  but with no effect; ",
  "and soon in the 17 5 Os this became a major cause of friction between ",
  "the Company and the local Mughal ruler in Bengal, creating the con\u00ad",
  "text  for the  emergence  of the  Company  as the imperial  power  in ",
  "lndia.102  However,  as its empire  in India was acquired  over a long ",
  "period  of  time-nearly  one  hundred  years-a  myriad  of  factors ",
  "motivated  this territorial  expansion.  As we examine  this protracted ",
  "process  in  detail,  it  becomes  clear  that  both  pressures  from  the ",
  "periphery  and  impetus  from  the  metropole  constantly  interacted ",
  "with each other,  and search for revenue, quest for trading  privileges ",
  "and the imperatives of military exigencies all took the driving seat in ",
  "tum  to  accelerate  the  process  of  territorial  conquest  and  erect  in ",
  "India the most magnificent empire  that Britain ever had. ",
  "It all started  in Bengal, which in the early eighteenth  century  had ",
  "become  very important  in the structure  of the  Company's  trade  at ",
  "the expense of the west coast, particularly  Bombay, Surat and Mala\u00ad",
  "bar, as Bengal goods came to comprise nearly 60 per cent of English ",
  "imports  from Asia.sm The  Company  was moving towards  this posi\u00ad",
  "tion gradually. In 1690 Aurangzeb's  farman  had granted  them  right ",
  "to duty-free  trade  in Bengal in return  for an annual  payment  of Rs. ",
  "3,000.  The  foundation  of Calcutta  in 1690  and its fortification  in ",
  "1696 were followed by the grant of zamindari rights in three villages ",
  "of Kolikata, Suranuri and Gobindapur  two years later. The situation ",
  "became  unstable  again at the  death  of Aurangzeb,  but  was forma\u00ad",
  "lised again by a farman  from  emperor  Farruksiyar  in  1717, which ",
  "granted  the Company  the right to carry on  duty free trade,  to rent ",
  "thirty-eight  villages around  Calcutta  and to use the royal  mint. But ",
  "this farman also became a new source of conflict between  the Com\u00ad",
  "pany and Murshid  Quli Khan, the new autonomous  ruler of Bengal, ",
  "who  refused to extend  its duty free provision  to cover also the pri\u00ad",
  "vate  trade  of the  Company  officials.  The  latter  the ref ore  took  to ",
  "rampant  misuse of dastaks, and the nawab resented  the loss of reve\u00ad",
  "nue. Apart  from  this, Murshid  Quli  also denied  permission  to the ",
  "Company  to buy  the  thirty-eight  villages and  refused  to offer  the ",
  "minting  privileges. The conflict  between  the Bengal nawab and  the ",
  "English Company  had thus started  developing  right  from  1717. ",
  "The outbreak  of the Austrian  Succession War in Europe  in 17 40 ",
  "brought  in hostilities  between  the  English  and  the  French  Com\u00ad",
  "panies to India. In Bengal the new nawab Alivardi Khan kept both of ",
  "them under control  and forbade them from getting involved in any https://telegram.me/UPSCMaterials https://telegram.me/FreeUPSCMaterials https://telegram.me/MaterialforExam",

  "fered  heavily  in  the  1750s  as  a  result  of  French  competition  in ",
  "collusion  with  Asian  merchants.  In  1755,  therefore,  the  English ",
  "began renovating  the fortifications in Calcutta  without  the nawab's ",
  "permission and in utter defiance of his authority began to offer pro\u00ad",
  "tection  to  fugitives  from  his court.  The  conflict  assumed  critical ",
  "dimensions when  Siraj-ud-daula  became nawab in 1756 and threat\u00ad",
  "ened  the  lucrative English  private  trade by stopping  all misuse  of ",
  "dastaks. The more immediate issues of discord were the grant of asy\u00ad",
  "lum to Krishna Ballabh who was charged with  fraud by the nawab ",
  "and the new fortifications at Calcutta-both  of which posed a chal\u00ad",
  "lenge to the authority  of the nawab and were critical to the issue of ",
  "sovereignty.  When  the Company failed  to listen  to warnings,  Siraj ",
  "showed his strength  by taking over the factory at Kasimbazar. Gov\u00ad",
  "ernor  Drake believed  that he could  avenge this defeat by force and ",
  "ignored the nawab's  overtures  for a diplomatic  reconciliation.  This ",
  "was followed  by  Siraj's  attack on  Calcutta and  its capture  on 20 ",
  "June. ",
  "This precipitated a crisis, as Robert Clive now arrived with a strong ",
  "force from Madras.  The English  fear about  Siraj's  friendship  with ",
  "the French and apprehension  that their trading  privileges would be ",
  "cut down  led to the destruction  of Hughli  and a French  defeat  at ",
  "Chandernagore. Apprehensive  of an  Afghan  attack  under  Abdali, ",
  "Siraj now preferred  a negotiated  settlement;  but a confident Clive ",
  "decided on a coup d'etat. The confident servants of the Company in ",
  "Calcutta were  not  prepared  to  tolerate  a young  tyrannical nawab ",
  "threatening to destroy their trading privileges and trying to squeeze ",
  "out a source of fabulous fortunes.'?' There was already a disaffected ",
  "faction at the nawab's court, consisting of merchants, bankers, finan\u00ad",
  "ciers and powerful  zamindars,  like the Ja gat Seth  brothers, Mah tab ",
  "Rai and Swamp  Chand,  Raja Janki  Ram, Rai  Durlabh, Raja Ram\u00ad",
  "narain and RajaManik Chand,  who felt threatened  by the assertion ",
  "of independence by a young nawab enthusiastically trying to reorder ",
  "the balance of power in his court. There was also a natural commu\u00ad",
  "nion of interests between  the Indian mercantile community and the ",
  "European  traders, as many of the Indian  merchants  were operating ",
  "in  collaboration  with  the  English  Company and  private  traders, ",
  "acting  as their dadani merchants  supplying  them  textiles from  the ",
  "interior  in  exchange  for  advances or  dadan.  Many  of  the  Indian https://telegram.me/UPSCMaterials https://telegram.me/FreeUPSCMaterials https://telegram.me/MaterialforExam",
  "44  FROM  PLASSEY TO P ARmJON ",
  "merchant princes had been prefering English ships for carrying their ",
  "cargo, and this in  fact resulted in the gradual decline of the port of ",
  "Hughli, giving its place of pride to Calcurta.P' So a collusion of the ",
  "two groups was not unlikely and what followed  as a  result was a ",
  "conspiracy  to replace Siraj with Mir jafar, his commander-in-chief, ",
  "who was the choice of the j agat  Seths, without whose support any ",
  "coup  d'etat  was virtually  impossible. The  question  whether there ",
  "was already a conspiracy in existence at the Murshidabad  court and ",
  "the English took advantage of that or it was the English who hatched ",
  "up  the conspiracy-a  question  over which historians  have  fought ",
  "their futile polemical battles-is less imporrarrr. What is important is ",
  "the fact that there was a collusion,  which  resulted  in the Battle of ",
  "Pia  ey (lune 1757), in which Siraj was finally defeated by Clive.  It ",
  "was hardly  more than a skirmish, as the largest contingent of the ",
  "nawabi army remained inactive under Mir Jafar's command.  But it ",
  "had  profound  political  impact, as fugitive Siraj was soon captured ",
  "and put to death  and  the new nawab Mir j afar became a puppet in ",
  "the hands of the English.  The Battle of Plassey (1757)  thus marked ",
  "the beginning of political supremacy of the English East India Com\u00ad",
  "pany in India. ",
  "What  followed hereafter is often  referred to as the \"Plassey plun\u00ad",
  "der\".  Immediately after the war  the  English  army and  navy  each ",
  "received the hefty  sums of \u00a3275,000  for distribution  among their ",
  "members.':\"  Apart  from that,  between  1757  and  1760,  the  Com\u00ad",
  "pany received Rs 22.5 million from Mir Jafar; Clive himself  got in ",
  "1759  a personal  jagir worth \u00a334,567. So far as the Company was ",
  "concerned,  it brought in a major change in the structure of its trade. ",
  "Prior  to  1757  the English  trade  in  Bengal was  largely  financed ",
  "through import ofbullion from England; but after that year not only ",
  "bullion  import  stopped,  but  bullion was exported from  Bengal  to ",
  "China and other  parts of India, which gave a competitive advantage ",
  "to the  English Company over  its European rivals.10s  On  the  other ",
  "hand,  for the Company  officials  Plassey opened  the gates to make ",
  "personal  fortunes,  not  only  through  direct  extortion,  but  also ",
  "through  rampant abuse of dastaks for their private  trade.  So after ",
  "some time Mir J afar found it difficult  to meet the financial demands ",
  "ofthe Company and was removed from the throne to be replaced by ",
  "his son-in-law Mir Kasim in October  1760. But conflict arose again ",
  "over the misuse of trade privileges by the Company's servants. Unable ",
  "to  stop  the misuse  of dasraks,  the new  nawab  abolished  internal ",
  "duties altogether, so that the Indian merchants could also enjoy the ",
  "same  privilege.  The English,  however, did  not like this  display of https://telegram.me/UPSCMaterials https://telegram.me/FreeUPSCMaterials https://telegram.me/MaterialforExam",
  "TRANSmON  OF THE  EIGHTEENTH  CENTIJRY  45 ",
  "independence  and as a retaliatory  measure, again replaced him with ",
  "Mir Jafar. ",
  "In December  1763 Mir Kasim fled from Bengal and tried to form ",
  "a grand alliance with the Mughal emperor  Shah Alam II and Shuja\u00ad",
  "ud-daula  of Awadh.  The  emperor  was  in the  region  since  1758, ",
  "when as a crown  prince he had fled from the  nasty politics of the ",
  "Delhi court  and tried to carve out for himself an independent  king\u00ad",
  "dom in the eastern  provinces.  In December  1759, hearing about  his ",
  "father's  assassination,  he  proclaimed  himself  the  emperor  and ",
  "appointed  Shuja his wazir. When Mir Kasim fled to him for refuge, ",
  "it was only after long and tortuous  negotiations  that the two agreed ",
  "to  proceed  against the  English;  Shuja's  support  was secured  after ",
  "he was promised  Bihar and  its treasury,  along with  a payment  of ",
  "Rs 30 million at the successful completion  of the mission. But their ",
  "combined  army was routed at the Battle of Buxar (1764 ), as an eigh\u00ad",
  "teenth-century  Indian army with  its segmentary  social organisation ",
  "was in serious  disadvantage  against  a technically  efficient  English ",
  "army with a unitary command. What followed the English victory at ",
  "Buxar  is  however  more  important.  The  Company  treated  the  de\u00ad",
  "feated Mughal emperor with respect, because of his continuing  sym\u00ad",
  "bolic significance in eighteenth-century  Indian politics.  Indeed,  not ",
  "before  1857 the British ever formally repudiated  the sovereignty of ",
  "\u2022 ",
  "the Mughal emperor.  In return,  by the Treaty of Allahabad of 1765, ",
  "Shah Alam granted  the  Company  the  diwani  (revenue  collecting ",
  "rights) of Bengal, Bihar and  Orissa-in  other  words,  absolute  con\u00ad",
  "trol  over  the  lucrative  resources  of the  prosperous  Bengal subah. ",
  "The  British Resident posted  at the court  of Murshidabad  hereafter ",
  "gradually by 1772 became the locus of real administrative  power  in ",
  "the  province  and thus  it was in Bengal that  the system of indirect ",
  "rule as a policy of the Company's  imperial governance was first iniri\u00ad",
  "ated.109 Awadh had to stand the pressure  of the Calcutta  Council's ",
  "lack of resources.  According to the treaty, Shuja-ud-daula  had to pay ",
  "Rs. 5 million;  the  nawab and the  Company  would  henceforth  de\u00ad",
  "fend each other's  territories;  a British Resident would  be posted  in ",
  "his court  and the Company would  enjoy duty free trading  rights in ",
  "Awadh-a  clause which in later years created fresh tensions and pre\u00ad",

  "As eastern  India  thus  came  under  control  of  the  Company  by ",

  "48  FROM  PLASSEYTO  PARTITION ",
  "Their main  centre  at  Pondicherry  was  founded  in  1674  and  was ",
  "raised to great political prominence  by Dupleix, the most illustrious ",
  "French  governor  general in India. He first became the governor  of ",
  "the  French  settlement  of Chandernagore  in  Bengal  in  1731  and ",
  "within  ten years French  trade  from this centre  increased  apprecia\u00ad",
  "bly. Dupleix was a workoholic,  who detested  India, but made a per\u00ad",
  "sonal fortune  through  involvement  in a profitable  private  trade.  In ",
  "1742 he got charge of Pondicherry and started working  immediately ",
  "to improve its trade and more significantly, to embark on a political ",
  "career.'!' It was he who had first showed  the way of intervening  in ",
  "disputes of the Indian rulers and thereby acquiring political control ",
  "over vast rerritories'Pe-e technique which was later perfected by the ",
  "English Company,  their  main European  trading  rival in the Indian ",
  "scene. The outbreak  of the Austrian  Succession War in Europe  in ",
  "17 40  provided  the  immediate  context  for  the  political  conflict ",
  "between the two European  rivals in India. Their  hostility in Bengal ",
  "had been contained  by the effective intervention  of Alivardi Khan. ",
  "But in the south, the French position was strengthened  by the arrival ",
  "of a fleet from Mauritius and this resulted in an attack on the English ",
  "position in Madras. With the surrender  of Madras the first Carnatic ",
  "war began,  as the  English appealed  to  the Nawab  of Carnatic  for ",
  "protection.  The  nawab sent a force against the French,  but it suf\u00ad",
  "fered an ignominious  defeat. At this stage the French  position  was ",
  "also weakened  by the differences between  Dupleix and Admiral  La ",
  "Bourdaunairs, who returned to Mauritius after surrendering Madras. ",
  "In September  17 46 Dupleix led a second attack  on Madras,  which ",
  "capitulated  and  this was followed  by a siege of Fort St.  David,  a ",
  "minor  English possession  to the  south  of Pondicherry.  But before ",
  "this could drag on any further,  the end of hostilities in Europe by the ",
  "Treaty  of Aix-La-Chappelle  brought an  end  to  the  first  round  of ",
  "Anglo-French  conflicts in India as well. The English possessions in ",
  "India were returned,  while the French got back their North Ameri\u00ad",
  "can possess10ns. ",
  "Political complexities  arising  from  dynastic  feuds  in India  pro\u00ad",
  "vided the context for the second round of Anglo-French conflict in ",
  "the south. The succession disputes at both  Carnatic  and Hyderabad ",
  "provided  the French Governor  General  Dupleix  an opportunity to ",
  "intervene  in Indian politics and secure thereby  important territorial ",
  "and financial concessions. The French supported Chanda  Sahib for ",
  "the  throne of Carnaric  and Muzaffar  Jung for that of Hyderabad, ",
  "while the English supported  their rival candidates.  Both the French ",
  "candidates  emerged victorious  and Muzaffar Jung,  the new Nizam https://telegram.me/UPSCMaterials https://telegram.me/FreeUPSCMaterials https://telegram.me/MaterialforExam",
  "TRANSITION  OF THE EIGHTEENTH  CENTURY  49 ",
  "of Hyderabad,  granted  substantial  territorial  concessions  to  the ",
  "French  in the form of a jagir in the Northern  Sarkars, Masulipatam ",
  "and some villages around  Pondicherry  and significant control  in his ",
  "court through  the appointment of a French agent. This alarmed the ",
  "English;  a strong force arrived  from Calcutta  under  Robert  Clive ",
  "and the Second Carnatic War began in 1752. The English this time ",
  "emerged victorious:  Clive's occupation  of Arcot was followed by the ",
  "release  of Muhammad  Ali, who was now  placed  on the  throne of ",
  "Carnatic, ",
  "Dupleix tried to retrieve French position;  but the French govern\u00ad",
  "ment became displeased with him, particularly because of the finan\u00ad",
  "cial losses,  and  he  was  recalled  in  1754.  His  failure  against  the ",
  "English can be explained in terms of various factors, such as his own ",
  "wrong  moves  and  miscalculations,  the  lack  of support  from  the ",
  "French government  and the Company, the French anxiety to retain ",
  "their possessions in North America and aJso the fundamental weak\u00ad",
  "ness of France in colonial  struggles,  as demonstrated also  in  later ",
  "warfare.  But the  policies  of  Dupleix  and  the  advantages  he  had ",
  "gained in India were not jettisoned  immediately. He was replaced  by ",
  "Godeheu, who signed a treaty with the English in 1754. The  treaty ",
  "left the French in possession of territories  around  Pondicherry  and ",
  "Karikal,  important posts in Carnatic,  the four Northern Sarkars and ",
  "controlling  influence at the Hyderabad  court.!'! The French  power ",
  "in the south  was thus far from over yet. ",
  "The outbreak of the Seven Years' War in Europe  between England ",
  "and France in 175 6 provided  the context  for the third  and decisive ",
  "round  of Anglo-French  conflict in south India. The French  position ",
  "by now had been significantly weakened  by financial difficulties, as ",
  "even  the  soldiers remained  unpaid  for  months. The  apathy  of the ",
  "French government  was shaken at the outbreak  of European hostili\u00ad",
  "ties and a strong force was dispatched  under  Count  de Lally. Yet the ",
  "French  lost  their  positions  in  India  one  after  another:  first  fell ",
  "Chandernagore in  Bengal; then  when  Bussy was  recalled  to  help ",
  "Lally  in  the  Camaric,  the  Northern  Sarkars  were  exposed  to  an ",
  "attack from Bengal;  the fall of the Sarkars together with  that of two ",
  "other  old  settlements  of  Masulipatam  and  Yanam ended  French ",
  "influence in the Deccan. The English fleet returned  from Bengal and ",
  "inflicted  heavy losses on  the  French  in August  1758;  and  all the ",
  "French strongholds in the Camatic were lost. LaJly's siege of Madras ",
  "had to be withdrawn  and the Nawab  of Carnatic paid for the cam\u00ad",
  "e_aign. The most decisive battle  of the Third  Camatic  War was the ",
  "battle  of  Wandiwash  in  January  1760.  In  May  Pondicherry  was https://telegram.me/UPSCMaterials https://telegram.me/FreeUPSCMaterials https://telegram.me/MaterialforExam",
  "50  FROM PLASSEY TO PARTITION ",
  "seized and  it capitulated  in January  1761,  once again  the  Carnatic ",
  "nawab paying for the campaign. Mahe in Malabar  coast and the last ",
  "two forts in Camatic-Jinji and Thiagar-fell  in the same year. The ",
  "French were now without  a toehold  in India. ",
  "A number of factors can be cited to explain this ultimate and deci\u00ad",
  "sive French  defeat-e.g.,  the  rashness and arrogance  of Lally, who ",
  "had managed to alienate nearly all the French officers at Pondicherry, ",
  "the acute shortage of money which hindered  military operations,  the ",
  "recall of Bussy from the Deccan and above all, the superiority  of the ",
  "English  navy,  their  ready  supply  of  money  and  their  new  self\u00ad",
  "confidence. By the Peace of Paris in 1763 France got back all the fac\u00ad",
  "tories and settlements  that it possessed in India prior  to 1749, with ",
  "the only proviso that it could not any more fortify Chandernagore. 114 ",
  "But the balance  of power  in India  had  by now  decisively changed ",
  "with  the steady expansion  of power of the English Company. The ",
  "French  East India Company was finally wound  up in 1769 and thus ",
  "was eliminated its main European  rival in India. It was now also the ",
  "de facto master of Carnatic, although  the Treaty of Paris had assured ",
  "the  nawab  his  entire  possessions.  His  nominal  sovereignty  was ",

  "had now begun to tilt decisively in its favour. ",
  "This brings us to the question of the Company's  relationship  with ",
  "the other  Indian  rulers.  The  Indian states  in the eighteenth  century ",
  "were perpetually involved in mutual conflicts. Their urge for territo\u00ad",
  "rial expansion was for gaining control  over new resources, because ",
  "internally  in many areas a limit had been reached  for extraction  of ",
  "fresh revenue. Politically each one was trying to establish supremacy ",
  "over others and the English were looked upon as a new force in this ",
  "power  game.  Combining  as a  nation  against  an  alien  power  was ",
  "beyond the imagination  of the Indian princes in the eighteenth  cen\u00ad",
  "tury political context.  It was no wonder,  therefore, that often they ",
  "entered  into diplomatic  alliances with the Company  in order to turn ",
  "the balance  of power in their favour in their contests against neigh\u00ad",
  "bours. This rivalry between the Indian states offered an opportunity, ",
  "while  commercial  interests  provided  a  sufficient  motivation  for https://telegram.me/UPSCMaterials https://telegram.me/FreeUPSCMaterials https://telegram.me/MaterialforExam",
  "51 ",
  "TRANSITION  OF  THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY ",
  "English  intervention  in  local politics.  However,  as  the  following ",
  "story would suggest, the Company was not just  responding to op\u00ad",
  "portunities,  as suggested  by  some  historians;  it was  also  showing ",
  "great deal of initiative in creating those opportunities to  intervene ",
  "and conquer, as insecure  frontiers or unstable states were often con\u00ad",
  "strued  as threats  to  free flow of trade.  It  is true that  for  a short ",
  "period after the passage of the Pitt's India Act in 1784 there was par\u00ad",
  "liamentary  prohibition  on imperial expansion,  and the major thrust ",
  "of the policy of the Board of Control and the East India Company ",
  "during  this  time  was to  protect  British  possessions  and  promote ",
  "trading  interests  through  a careful  balance  of power  between the ",
  "Indian states, thus reducing imperial military liabilities. But that cau\u00ad",
  "tious policy was jettisoned when Lord Wellesley arrived as governor ",
  "general  in  1798,  with a dream of conquest  and a lust for personal ",
  "glory. The policy of balance of power no longer worked in India, he ",
  "decided even before arriving in the country, and so what was needed ",
  "was empire. Napoleonic invasion  of Egypt in the summer  of  1798 ",
  "offered him a useful tool to soften London's resistance to expansion, ",
  "although  he never believed for a moment that there was any danger ",
  "of a French invasion of British  India either over land from Egypt or ",
  "a naval  attack  round  the  Cape of Good  Hope. However,  to assu\u00ad",
  "age  London's concerns  he evolved  the  policy of  'Subsidiary  Alli\u00ad",
  "ance', which  would  only  establish control  over  the internal  affairs ",
  "of an  Indian  state,  without  incurring  any  direct  imperial  liability. ",
  "Wellesley's personal agenda for expansion  was also buttressed  by a ",
  "change of personnel in the Anglo-Indian diplomatic  service favour\u00ad",
  "ing such a forward policy. As Edward Ingram has argued, Wellesley ",
  "was \"not formulating a policy in  response  to  local conditions  but ",
  "trying  to create the conditions  necessary for the attainment  of his ",
  "objectives....  If Indian politics were turbulent, he described them as ",
  "threatening,  if  they  were  tranquil,  he  ruffled  them.\"  However, ",
  "authorities in London were not gullible or innocent observers in this ",
  "imperial  drama  either. They  sanctioned  all the aggressive moves in ",
  "pursuance  of the  most important objective of British foreign policy ",
  "since 1784,  i.e.  protecting  British India against all threats  from  its ",
  "European  rivals. Wellesley was recalled in 1805 only when his wars ",
  "of conquest  landed the Company's administration  in India in a seri\u00ad",

  "Within  this context,  it does not become difficult  to understand ",
  "why the political power of Mysore under Haidar Ali and Tipu Sultan ",
  "appeared  to be a security threat to the English position  in Madras ",
  "and  in the Camaric. In course of a few years, Mysore's boundaries https://telegram.me/UPSCMaterials https://telegram.me/FreeUPSCMaterials https://telegram.me/MaterialforExam",
  "52 ",
  "FROM PLASSEYTO PARTITION ",
  "had stretched  from the Krishna in the north  to the Malabar  coast in ",
  "the  west,  which  inevitably brought  it into  conflict  with  its Indian ",
  "neighbours,  notably  Hyderabad  and  the  Marathas.  And  the  two ",
  "were  often  in collusion  with  the  English, who  suspected  Mysore's ",
  "friendship  with the French.  But this threat  perception  was more an ",
  "\"illusion\" than real, as there was now very little chance of a possible ",
  "French revival in India or a French attack from outside.116  Mysore's ",
  "control  over  the  rich  trade  of the Malabar  coast  was also seen  as ",
  "a threat  to English  trade  in pepper  and  cardamom.  In 1785  Tipu ",
  "declared  an embargo  on export  of pepper, sandalwood  and  carda\u00ad",
  "mom  through  the ports  within  his kingdom;  in 178 8  he explicitly ",
  "forbade  dealings  with  English traders.  The  interests  of the  private ",
  "Company merchants  now inevitably dictated  a policy of direct polit\u00ad",
  "ical intervention  to protect  their  commercial  interests.111  But most ",
  "significantly,  Tipu  Sultan  was trying  to  build  in Mysore  a strong ",
  "centralised  and  militarised  state,  with  ambitious  territorial  designs ",
  "and a political aspiration  to control  south Indian politics. This made ",
  "him the most potent danger to the as yet vulnerable  Company  state ",
  "in the south. Young army officers like Thomas Munro  and Alexander ",
  "Read could see that  the \"mercantilist  state\"  of Mysore  represented ",
  "the same kind of hegemonic ambition as those of the Company  state ",
  "in  the  south  and  therefore  could  never  be  relied  upon  in  any ",
  "arrangement  of indirect  rule based  on  the  principle  of balance  of ",
  "power among the Indian states. Hence,  although  the civilian admin\u00ad",
  "istration  in Madras vacillated, they concurred  with Governor  Gen\u00ad",
  "erals Lord Cornwallis  and later Lord Wellesley that Mysore  needed ",
  "to be eliminated. 118 ",
  "There  were four rounds  of battle  (1767-69,  1780-84,  1790-92, ",
  "and  1799)  between  the  Company  and  Mysore,  before  the  latter ",
  "could be finaJlytaken over in 1799.  In the first Anglo-Mysore  War, ",
  "the  Marathas  and  the  nizam were  with  the  British against  Haidar ",
  "Ali; in the second, they joined hands with Haidar against the British. ",
  "But again the  two powers  sided with  the British in 1790 when  the ",
  "latter  under  Lord Cornwallis  declared  war on Tipu  Sultan who had ",
  "lately attacked  their ally, the Raja of Travancore.  At the end of this ",
  "war the Company  annexed  Dindigul, Baramahal and Malabar. A few ",
  "years  later,  the  spectre  of  a  French  resurgence  and  Tipu's  secret ",
  "negotiations  with  them  gave a pretext  to  Lord  Wellesley to  move ",
  "decisively  for  the  final round  of colonial  aggression.  In  1799  Sri\u00ad",
  "rangapatnam,  the capital of Mysore, fell to the Company, while Tipu ",
  "died defending  it. Mysore,  then  once again placed under the former ",
  "Wodeyar  dynasty, was brought  under  the  'Subsidiary  Alliance'  sys\u00ad",

  "Mysore.  Under  this system,  it would  not  henceforth  enter  into  any ",
  "relationship  with  other European  powers; a contingent  of Company ",
  "army would  be stationed  in Mysore  and the provision  for its mainte\u00ad",

  "given to the nizam who had already  accepted a 'Subsidiary  Alliance'; ",
  "and  parts of  it,  such  as  Wynad,  Coimbatore,  Canara  and  Sunda, ",
  "were  directly annexed  by the  Company. ",
  "Meanwhile,  the  sudden  growth  of  the  Company's  cotton  trade ",
  "with  China  through  Bombay  from  Gujarat  made  them  concerned ",
  "about the security of Deccan,  then  under the control  of the Maratha ",

  "intervention,  as  Raghunath  Rao,  who  had  his  nephew  Peshwa ",
  "Narayan  Rao killed in a conspiracy,  now faced combined  opposition ",
  "of the Mararha  sardars and  began to look at the British  in Bombay  as ",
  "a possible  new  ally.  In March  1775  Raghunath  Rae's  forces  were ",
  "defeated  in Gujarat, and a combined  British army  from  Madras  and ",
  "Bombay  arrived  in his rescue.  An inconclusive  treaty  of Purandar  in ",
  "1776  offered  a number of concessions  to  the Company  in return  for ",
  "its withdrawal  of support  for Raghunath  Rao. But  the treaty  was not ",
  "ratified  by the  authorities  at Bengal  and  war was resumed  again  in ",
  "1777.  By  now  the  Maratha  forces  had  regrouped  under  Nana ",
  "Fadnis,  Sindhia and  Holkar and  inflicted  a crushing  defeat  on  the ",
  "British  at  Wadgaon  (1779).  The  latter  however  got the  revenue  of ",

  "the Gaikwad  to surrender  it This was the period  that wimessed  the ",

  "By 1781  he and the Bhonsle  family had formed  a grand  alliance  with ",
  "the nizam  and  Haidar  Ali against  the  British.  But the  inconclusive ",
  "First Anglo-Maratha War came to an end in 1782  through the Treaty ",
  "of Salbai,  which  committed  the Marathas  once  again  to  friendship ",
  "with  the Company  and  also  to a confrontation  with  Mysore. ",
  "The  Maratha  state  was,  however,  in  a deplorable  condition  by ",
  "now,  due  to  the  bitter  internal  rivalry  between  the  ardars.  Nana ",

  "peshwa  Baji  Rao  II wanted  to  get  rid  of Fadnis and  sought  allies in ",
  "different  quarters.  With  the  Latter's  death  in  1800  the  confusion ",
  "deepened  even  further.  While  Daulat  Rao  Sindhia  supported  the ",
  "peshwa,  the  Holkar's  army  started  plundering  his  territories  in ",
  "Malwa. A desperate  peshwa once again looked  at the Company  for ",

  "54  FROM  PLASSEY TO PARTmON ",
  "been  a  remarkable  change  in British  attitudes  towards  the  Indian ",
  "states:  Hyderabad,  as we have already seen, had accepted  'Subsid\u00ad",
  "a ",
  "iary Alliance' and Mysore was crushed in 1799. So, this brought  the ",
  "Company  face to face with the Marathas,  the only remaining signifi\u00ad",
  "cant  indigenous  power  in  the  subcontinent.  After  Holkar's  army ",
  "defeated the peshwa's  forces and plundered  Poona in October  1802, ",
  "the peshwa fled to the British in Basscin and in 1803 was obliged to ",

  "tion.P? The English East India Company had now complete mastery ",
  "over all the territories south of the Vindhyas. ",
  "In north India too there had  been by now significant  acquisition ",
  "of territories.  Ever since  the  victory  at  Buxar  and  the  Treaty  of ",
  "Allahabad,  A wadh was serving  as a buffe r state between the Com- ",
  "pany's position in Bengal and  the turbulent  politics in north  India, ",
  "particularly  imperilled  by Maratha  depredations.  British  strategic ",
  "interests in Awadh were secured  by the stationing  of a Resident at ",
  "the court of Lucknow in 1773  and the positioning  of a permanent ",
  "British  garrison in Awadh, to be paid  for by Nawab  Shuja-ud-daula ",
  "through  the  payment of a subsidy. Soon,  however,  this became a ",
  "contentious issue, as the amount  of subsidy demanded by the Com\u00ad",
  "pany  increased  gradually. To  meet  this  increasing  demand,  the ",
  "nawab had to impo  e more taxes, which soured his relationship with ",
  "the taluqdars. This was the prime  reason for more political instabil\u00ad",
  "ity in the state, which eventually became a pretext  for direct annex\u00ad",
  "ation. Warren Hastings, who became the governor general in  1774, ",
  "had first argued that the best way to ensure regular  payment of the ",
  "subsidy  was to  annex  those  territories  of Awadh whose  revenues ",
  "were equal to the amount of subsidy. Distraught  by the French and ",
  "Mysore wars, the Company's desperate need for money at this stage ",
  "was amply  revealed  in the  demands  imposed  on  Chait  Singh  of ",
  "Banaras, his inability  to pay and his subsequent deposition in August ",
  "1781. The crisis wa  also manifested in the bizarre saga of extortion, ",
  "under direct instruction  from Warren Hastings, from the Begums of ",
  "Awadh, who still controlled the treasures of Shuja, ostensibly  to pay ",
  "the mounting  debt of the nawab to the Company. ",
  "So annexation of A wadh was clearly on the cards for quite some ",
  "time and Wellesley gave it a concrete shape in 1801, when the nawab ",
  "expressed  his apprehension  that  he might  not  be able  to pay the ",
  "subsidy. There  were  other  reasons  too.  Ever since  the  Treaty of ",
  "Allahabad, Nawab Shuja-ud-daula  had been complaining about the ",
  "rampant  abuse  of the Company's duty free  trading  rights by the ",
  "European  private  traders  and  their Indian gomustahs.  The  Com\u00ad",
  "pany's  authorities only half-heartedly  tried  to control  it, as it was ",
  "beyond  their power co re train these merchants.  Moreover,  Awadh https://telegram.me/UPSCMaterials https://telegram.me/FreeUPSCMaterials https://telegram.me/MaterialforExam",
  "56F ROM PLASSEYTO PARTITION ",
  "had become crucially important  for expanding  British seabom  trade ",
  "from Bengal. In the last decade of the eighteenth  century, there was ",
  "an expanding  demand  for indigo in London, and about three-fifths ",
  "of its total export  from India came from Awadh. By the beginning of ",
  "the  nineteenth  century,  Awadh  raw cotton  became another  chief ",
  "item of supply to China market to keep the imperial balance of trade ",
  "in favour of Britain.121  In this context, the high rate of taxes imposed ",
  "by the nawab on exports  from Awadh even after the treaty of 1788, ",
  "signed  during the time of Lord  Cornwallis to  ensure  \"free trade\", ",
  "122 ",
  "was certainly an irritant.  Annexation seemed imminent  when with ",
  "the arrival of Lord Wellesley there was a clear tilt in Company's pol\u00ad",
  "icies in favour of vigorous expansion. ",
  "The first opportunity  for intervention  was provided in  1797  by ",
  "the  death  of Nawab  Asaf-ud-daula, who  had  succeeded  Shuja in ",
  "177 5. The English refused to recognise the claim of his son to suc\u00ad",
  "ceed  and  put  the  late  nawab' s  brother  Saadat  Ali  Khan  on  the ",
  "throne.  As a price, the latter agreed to transfer a few territories and ",
  "pay a staggering annual subsidy of Rs. 7.6  million.  Yet, this did not ",
  "solve the problem,  as the new nawab, though willing to pay subsidy, ",
  "was not prepared  to accept British  interference  in his administra\u00ad",
  "tion. In 1801, Wellesley, therefore, sent his brother Henry to impose ",
  "on him a treaty, which resulted in the annexation of half of Awadh as ",
  "a permanent  payment  of the subsidy. In real terms, this amounted  to ",
  "the cession of Rohilkhand, Gorakhpur  and the Doab, which yielded ",
  "a gross revenue  of Rs.  13,523,4 75-almost  double the amount  of ",
  "the subsidy.I\"  Wellesley justified  his action  in terms of high moral ",
  "argument, i.e., to save Awadh from incurably bad native administra\u00ad",
  "124 ",
  "tion;  but it is difficult to separate this issue from the revenue  and ",
  "commercial  demands of imperialism.  12J What is more significant, the ",
  "problem did  not end  there.  The  arrangement of 1801  did  not  end ",
  "British  extortion, though  it was meant to be a final payment  of sub\u00ad",
  "sidy.  The office of the Residency  in Lucknow  gradually  developed ",
  "into  an alternative  centre  of power within  Awadh,  fabricating  its ",
  "own constituency of courtiers, administrators and landlords, bought ",
  "off with  various  kinds  of favours and  extra-territorial  protection. ",
  "The  Resident  thus  systematically  isolated  the  nawab  undermined ",
  "his political  and moral  authority  and  reduced his military  capabili\u00ad",
  "126 ",
  "ties.  When  Lord  Dalhousie  finally  annexed  the  remainder  of ",
  "Awadh in  1856 on grounds of misgovernment,  it was only a logical ",
  "culmination  of a long-drawn  out process. ",
  "The only  other  major  power  now left in  north  India were  the ",

  "under Ranjit Singh in the late eighteenth century (1795-98). During ",
  "his lifetime there  was no major tension  with  the British;  but after ",
  "his death  Punjab became politically unstable.  A number  of people ",
  "ascended  the throne  in quick succession and the whole region was ",
  "plunged  into  prolonged  and  bloody  succession battles.  But  what ",
  "contributed  to  these  family feuds and  court  conspiracies  was  the ",
  "breakdown  of the delicate  balance of power  that  Ranjit Singh had ",
  "carefully maintained  between the hereditary  Sikh chieftains and the ",
  "upstarts,  and between the Punjabi and Dogra nobles from Jammu in ",
  "the royal court.  Corruption  in the bureaucracy and the internecine ",
  "strife among the sardars put the Punjab economy into shambles. In ",
  "the  countryside,  revenue  demands  increased after  1839 due  to the ",
  "rise in the cost of the army, resulting in zarnindar resistance to reve\u00ad",
  "nue collection. On the other hand, the kardars increased their extor\u00ad",
  "tion  of the landed zarnindars and continued  to defraud the central ",
  "treasury. The developments  only encouraged centrifugal tendencies ",
  "within  the  Punjabi society.121  The  commercial  classes were  disen\u00ad",
  "chanted  by  political  disruptions  and  the  whole  situation  offered ",
  "opportunities to the British to intervene. ",
  "To tell the story briefly, when Ranjit Singh died in  1839, he had ",
  "nominated  his son  Kharak Singh to  be his successor. He  was not ",
  "known to be a very able administrator  and became dependent  on his ",
  "Dogra wazir Raja Dhian Singh. The relationship  was initially cor\u00ad",
  "dial, but soon the maharaja tried to clip his wazir's wings by patron\u00ad",
  "ising the anti-Dogra  faction in his court.  But the wazir fought back, ",
  "allied himself with the maharaja's son Nao Nihal Singh, but before ",
  "this could  go much further,  Kharak  Singh died  in  1840, followed ",
  "immediately by the death of his son in an accident. Now the throne ",
  "was  contested  by Sher  Singh,  one  of the  six  living princes,  and ",
  "Maharani  Chand Kaur, the widow of Kharak Singh, who laid a claim ",
  "on behalf of her unborn grandchild to be born to Nihal Singh's wid\u00ad",
  "owed wife. In this contest  Sher Singh was supported  by the Dogra ",
  "faction, while the Maharani's  claim was upheld by the Sindhanwalia ",
  "chieftains, who were collaterals of the royal family. Both the candi\u00ad",

  "not to interfere. Sher Singh ultimately became the maharaja through ",

  "their  revenge by getting  him  murdered  in 1843 along with  his son, ",
  "and also wazir Dhian  Singh. But soon the table was turned  again by ",
  "the  latter's  son Raja Hira Singh Dogra,  who won over  a section  of ",
  "the  army,  destroyed  the  Sindhanwalias  and  put  up  Ranjit  Singh's ",
  "youngest  son five year old Dalip Singh on the throne,  with  himself ",
  "taking on the wazir' s office. ",
  "Palace intrigues and rivalries among the sardars did not end there. ",
  "But now the Khalsa army became a power unto  itself and began to ",
  "control  Punjabi  politics.  During  Sher  Singh's  reign  the  army  had ",
  "established  regimental  committees  or panchayats,  which  had direct ",
  "access  to  the  maharaja.  These  panchayats  now  began  to  demand ",
  "more and  more concessions  from the darbar, and  Hira Singh could ",
  "survive only by making larger grants to the\"army. But this could not ",
  "go on  for  long as anti-Dogra  sentiments  began  to  rise  among  the ",
  "army and the  hereditary chieftains.  Hira  Singh was assassinated  in ",
  "December  1844, whereupon  Dalip Singh's mother  Maharani Jindan ",
  "became the Regent and her brother  Sardar J awahir Singh became the ",
  "wazir;  but  he remained  for  all practical  purposes  a puppet  in the ",
  "hands of the army. It was this  political  rise of the Khalsa .army, its ",
  "new experiments  with democratic  republicanism,  and  the prospect ",
  "of there being no stable government  in Lahore that made the British ",
  "concerned  about  Punjab.  In the  early nineteenth  century  the  Com\u00ad",
  "pany wanted  to maintain the Sikh state as a buffer between  its north ",
  "Indian  possessions on the one end and the Muslim powers in Persia ",
  "and  Afghanistan  on  the  other.  But  continuous  political  instability ",
  "made that scheme unworkable  and so many in the early 1840s began ",
  "to think of the inevitability  of an Anglo-Sikh confrontation.  Prepara\u00ad",
  "tions for this on the British side began in 1843, and as the situation ",
  "did not stabilise, and when jawahir Singh was executed  by the army ",
  "in  September  1945,  Lord  Hardinge  decided  that  the  time  for  a ",
  "showdown  had arrived. He declared  war on the state  of Lahore  on ",
  "13 December  1845 and the first Anglo-Sikh war began.!\" ",
  "Failure  of leadership and treachery  of some of the sardars  led  to ",
  "the defeat  of the  formidable  Sikh army. The  humiliating  treaty  of ",
  "Lahore  in March  1846 resulted  in the English annexation  of Jalan\u00ad",
  "dhar  Doab;  Kashmir  was  given  to  Raja  Ghulab  Singh  Dogra  of ",
  "jammu,  as a reward  for his allegiance to the  Company.  The  size of ",
  "the  Lahore  army was reduced,  and  an English army  was stationed ",
  "there.  Dalip  Singh was to retain  his throne,  but  was to be advised ",
  "and  guided  by  an  English Resident.  Another  treaty  in  December ",
  "removed Maharani  Jindan  from  the  position  of Regent,  formed  a ",
  "Regency Council and gave the English Resident at Lahore extensive https://telegram.me/UPSCMaterials https://telegram.me/FreeUPSCMaterials https://telegram.me/MaterialforExam",
  "59 ",
  "TRANSITION  OF THE  EIGHTEENTH  CENTURY ",
  "authority to direct and control  the activities of every department  of ",
  "state.  But the  ultimate  British aim was full annexation  of Punjab, ",
  "which was achieved by Governor  General Lord Dalhousie after the ",
  "victory in the Second Anglo-Sikh  War in 1849. The immediate  pre\u00ad",
  "text for aggression  was the rebellion of two Sikh  governors, Diwan ",
  "Mui Raj of Multan and Sardar  Chartar Singh Atariwala and his son ",
  "Raja  Sher  Singh  of Haripur.  In the  first  two  rounds  of battle  at ",
  "Ramnagar in November 1848 and at ChillianwaJainJanuary  1849, ",
  "the British suffered heavy  losses. But this was soon reversed in Feb\u00ad",
  "ruary-March, as the rebel sardars surrendered  one after another. On ",
  "29 March 1849 Maharaja Dalip Singh signed the document ofa nnex\u00ad",
  "ation; Punjab hereafter became  a province  of the East India Com\u00ad",
  "pany's empire in India.P? ",
  "Other parts of India were also gradually coming under  direct or ",
  "indirect control  of the Company during the nineteenth  century, as ",
  "empire itself-or  more precisely, the security of the empire-became ",
  "an argument  justifying  further  imperial expansion. The authorities ",
  "in India, particularly the  military establishment,  continually antici\u00ad",
  "pated dangers from outside as well as from within to the security of ",
  "the Indian empire, and the best guarantee  of security they believed ",
  "was a vigorous display  of the power  of the sword.  This argument ",
  "swept aside all the cautionary attitudes  that the Company directors ",
  "in  London  might  have  had  against  further  territorial  aggression. ",
  "Lord Amherst came to India as governor  general  with a clear man\u00ad",
  "date to ensure peace and eschew expensive  imperial  wars, but came ",
  "to face a growing crisis  with Burma in the northeastern  borders of ",
  "Bengal.  The  Burmese  monarchy  had  been  showing  expansionary ",
  "tendencies since the second half of the eighteenth  century, when  it ",
  "subjugated Pegu, Tenasserim and Arakan and then in the early years ",
  "ofthe nineteenth  century extended its influence in Manipur,  Cachar ",
  "and  finally Assam. These moves in the past did  not always lead  to ",
  "annexation  and  so the  earlier  governors  general  chose to  ignore ",
  "them. But in 1822-23  the Anglo-Indian military elite began to argue, ",
  "after a lull in imperial warfare for about six years, that the internal ",
  "enemies of the empire were drawing encouragement  from the auda\u00ad",
  "cious incursions of the Burmese. So the Burmese needed to be treated ",
  "a lesson, preferably through a vigorous display of power.P? Hence in ",
  "1824-28 began the Company's First Burma War,which brought  the ",
  "annexation  of Assam and N agaland in northeastern  India as well as ",
  "Arakan and Tenasserim in Lower Burma. In 1830 Cachar was added ",
  "to Company's  territory; Coorg was later  annexed  in 1834 by Lord ",
  "Bentinck. https://telegram.me/UPSCMaterials https://telegram.me/FreeUPSCMaterials https://telegram.me/MaterialforExam",
  "60  FROM PLASSEYTO PARTITION ",
  "If Burma was a threat  in the northeast,  Russo-phobia  before  and ",
  "after the Crimean War (1854-56) provided a prime motive for Brit\u00ad",
  "ish expansion towards the northwest. Lord Auckland fought the first ",
  "Afghan War in  1838-42 to  install indirect  rule  by restoring  a de\u00ad",
  "posed king on the Afghan throne;  and Lord Ellen borough  took over ",
  "Sind in  1843. However,  it was during  the time of Lord  Dalhousie ",
  "(1848-5 6) that  expansionist  tendencies  became most manifest dur\u00ad",
  "ing Company's regime. By using his \"Doctrine of Lapse\", i.e.,  the pol\u00ad",
  "icy of annexing  the territories  of Indian rulers who died without  a ",
  "male heir, he took over Satara (1848), Sambalpur and Baghat (1850), ",
  "Udaipur  (1852), Nagpur  (1853) and  Jhansi  (1854). The  Second ",
  "Burma War (1852-53)resulted in the annexation  of Pegu, while in ",
  "1853 he took over Berar from Hyderabad  to secure the payment  of ",
  "subsidy for the Company's  army. Thus by 1857 the  Company  had ",
  "annexed  about  63 per cent of the territories  of the Indian subconti\u00ad",
  "nent and had subordinated  over 78 per cent of its population.'!'  The ",
  "remaining territories were left in charge of Indian princes, who were ",
  "relied upon after 1858 for ensuring the loyalty of their people to the ",
  "British Raj. Its policies by now had shifted from those of annexation ",
  "to that of indirect  rule.!\" Quite often,  however, the princely states ",
  "had to experience  intensive British intervention,  although  formally ",
  "no more annexation  occurred  (see chapter  2.4  for more details on ",
  "princely states and indirect  rule). ",
  "To sum up our discussion, whether intended by the government  at ",
  "home or crafted by the East India Company's servants on the spot\u00ad",
  "supposedly sucked into a career of conquest  by the political crisis of ",
  "eighteenth  century  India-the  link between  commercial  and politi\u00ad",
  "cal expansion is not difficult to discern in the story of imperialism in ",
  "India in the late eighteenth  and early nineteenth  centuries. By way of ",
  "identifying the continuities  in British imperial history, Gallagher and ",
  "Robinson (1953) argued that the British policy should be summed up ",
  "as \"trade with informal control  if possible; trade with rule when nee\u00ad",
  "essary\".  It may be pointed  our,  however, that  differences  between ",
  "such analytical categories are rather dubious;  it was from attempts  to ",
  "secure trade benefits through  informal control  that the necessity to ",
  "secure direct rule arose more often. The considerable  growth  of pri\u00ad",
  "vate trade  and the expansion  of the activities of free merchants  had ",
  "been dependent  on the growth ofBritish power and this created pos\u00ad",
  "sibilities  of conflict.  Indian  rulers  were  constantly  pressurised  to ",
  "grant  immunities  and  concessions  and  in the  end,  such  successive ",
  "demands corroded  the authority  of the Indian states. It was possible ",
  "for the Company  to effectively exert pressure because of the rivalry ",
  "among the Indian rulers and factionalism within their courts,  which https://telegram.me/UPSCMaterials https://telegram.me/FreeUPSCMaterials https://telegram.me/MaterialforExam",
  "61 ",
  "TRANSITION  OF THE EIGHTEENTH  CENTURY ",
  "prevented the formation  of a joint front The dream of Nana Fadnis ",
  "to forge a confederacy of Indian princes pitted against British power ",
  "never really actualised. 133 ",
  "Thus  for the Company, commerce  provided  the will to  conquer ",
  "and the political disunity provided the opportunity; now there was ",
  "the question of capacity to conquer an empire. In spite of the Mughal ",
  "decline,  the successor states were not weak, though in terms of mili\u00ad",
  "tary  organisation and  technology, their armies  were  backward  in ",
  "comparison  with  the  European forces.  The  Anglo-French  rivalry ",
  "brought in Crown troops to India at an unprecedented  scale and this ",
  "increased British military power, indicating a greater positive input ",
  "of the metropolis  in the affairs of the Indian empire. But what was ",
  "more significant, the Company at this stage decided to raise its own ",
  "army in India, to be disciplined and commanded  by European offi\u00ad",
  "cers.  The size of this Company army steadily increased, giving  it a ",
  "decisive military edge  over  its  political  adversaries.  On  the other ",
  "hand, the new army itself became a reason for fresh demands on the ",
  "Indian rulers and hence the perpetual tension about the amount and ",
  "payment of subsidies.  The  Company's  obsession  with stable  fron\u00ad",
  "tiers,  as a necessary precondition  for smooth operation  of trade, ",
  "was another motivation behind  conquest, as one annexation brought ",
  "them to more unstable frontiers, which necessitated more conquests. ",
  "However, it  was also  the  army  establishment-that  devoured  the ",
  "largest  share  of the  Indian  revenues-which  deliberately  created ",
  "and reinforced  such an environment of scare that continually  antici\u00ad",
  "pated  threats  to the security of the empire either from an allegedly ",
  "militarised  Indian society  or from outside.  Conquest therefore be\u00ad",
  "came a self-perpetuating  and self-legitimising process, justifying the ",
  "maintenance of a vast military establishment  (for more on the army, ",
  "see chapter 2.4). ",
  "The success  of the  East India  Company also  depended  on  its ",
  "capacity  to mobilise greater  resources  than  its rivals. The  soldiers ",
  "fighting at the frontline for the Company's army were better fed and ",
  "regularly  paid in contrast to those servicing the Mughal  successor ",
  "states.  The  Indian  bankers  who  controlled  and  transferred  large ",
  "sums of money through hundis, seemed to have been preferring the ",
  "Company as a more  trustworthy  creditor than  the unstable Indian ",
  "princes.P\"  The  Company gradually reduced  this dependence  and ",
  "turned  it upside down by establishing control  over the revenue re\u00ad",
  "sources,  which  became  vital for  financing trade as well  as further ",
  "conquests.  Revenue  considerations  got  the  Company  involved  in ",
  "administration  and  thus there  was  the  progression  from  military https://telegram.me/UPSCMaterials https://telegram.me/FreeUPSCMaterials https://telegram.me/MaterialforExam",
  "62  FROM  PLASSEY TO P ARTITlON ",
  "ascendancy  to dominion  of territory-from  indirect  rule  to  direct ",
  "annexation.  This  approximates  closely  to the  point  made  by  Cain ",
  "and  Hopkins  about the primacy  of revenue  in the functioning  of ",
  "British  imperialism  in  India.  The  politically  emerging  alliance  at ",
  "home  between  land  and  money,  they  argue,  created  the notion  of ",
  "power  being  centred  in  land  and  hence  the  preoccupation  of the ",
  "Company-state  with \"the  need  to  raise  revenue  as well  as to keep ",
  "order\",  which  determined  the  course  of  much  of the  later  annex\u00ad",
  "ations  and  consolidation  of  British  rule  in  lndia.P!  The  consan\u00ad",
  "guinity  between  revenue,  commerce  and military  exigencies  in the ",
  "process  of British  imperial  expansion  in India is a point too obvious ",
  "to miss;  it is futile  to debate  over their relative  importance.  It is also ",
  "difficult  to  deny  that  from  the  late  eighteenth  century  the  colonial ",
  "state  was  being  fashioned  by the  ideologies  and  values  of Georgian ",
  "England, using state  power to gamer the fruits  of capitalism,  to pro\u00ad",
  "tect the liberal  benefits  of freedom  of trade or right to property  and ",
  "to secure  markets  for commodities  at home and  abroad.Ps  Both  at ",
  "ideational  and functional  levels,  the  pressures  from  the  periphery ",
  "and  the interests  of the  metropole  worked  in  conjunction  in  con\u00ad",
  "quering and administering  the empire  in India.  It is in the next chap\u00ad",
  "ter that  we  will  discuss  in more  detail  how  these  political  debates ",
  "in  England  actually  informed  the  modes  of  imperial  governance ",
  "in India. ",
