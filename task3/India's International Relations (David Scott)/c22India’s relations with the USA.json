  "ideational values, in this case \u2018democracy\u2019, which united India and the USA.1 India was the",

  "racy in power terms. In their subsequent Joint Statement, India-US Relations: A Vision for the",
  "21st Century (2000), both countries stressed these values shared in common, and looked for-",
  "ward to \u2018a day of new beginnings\u2019 in relations between the two countries.2 The irony is that",
  "from the 1950s through to the 1990s India and the USA were rather estranged, yet a decade",
  "later India was indeed \u2018crossing the Rubicon\u2019 in establishing close defence-military-strategic",

  "Ironies abound in their relationship. Take, for example, the last days of British colonialism.",
  "Winston Churchill may have famously said that he had not become Prime Minister in order to",
  "preside over the death of the British Empire, yet it was US pressure, by Franklin D. Roosevelt,",
  "that played its part in pushing Britain to retreat from India, its \u2018jewel in the crown\u2019.4 The USA",
  "should have been in pole position as India took its place as an independent state, proudly pro-",
  "claiming the virtues of democracy, yet instead it was a situation of \u2018estranged democracies\u2019 for",
  "the following decades.5",
  "Divergent alignments",

  "Treaty Organization\u2014SEATO), which would encircle and contain the USSR. Its logic was",
  "that if states were not with it then they were against it. On the other hand, India refused to",
  "alignitselfwitheithertheUS(orSoviet)camp.FortheUSAtherewasnothirdway,however,",
  "and Nehru\u2019s advocacy of non-alignment was viewed at best as weak and hypocritical, and at",
  "worst as giving the advantage to the USSR.",
  "Even whilst India resolutely proclaimed the virtues of non-alignment, its adversary Pakistan",
  "was quick to align with the USA and its alignment systems, joining CENTO and SEATO on",

  "granting of military aid by the United States to Pakistan creates a grave situation for us in India",
  "[\u2026] it adds to our tensions\u2019.6 Such logic continues down to the present.",
  "Some of the rhetoric could still be invoked. First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis\u2019 visit to",

  "However, whilst Nehru did, in e\ufb00ect, tear-up his non-alignment distance and ask for US",
  "military aid amidst the military debacle against China, the reluctance of the USA to commit",
  "itself to any signi\ufb01cant assistance meant a continuation of the rather cool nature of US-Indian",
  "relations. Conversely, US relations with Pakistan worried India, with ongoing concerns",
  "expressed by India: \u2018the Government of India regrets the decision of the United States Gov-",
  "ernment to undertake supplies of spare parts of lethal weapons to Pakistan [\u2026] the reactivation",
  "of Pakistan\u2019s military machine, which the US decision will necessarily bring about, will pose a",
  "threat again to India\u2019.7 Such coolness in relations between India and the USA were com-",
  "pounded by India\u2019s tilt towards the USSR that took place in the 1960s and 1970s. One of the",

  "Nehru\u2019s daughter, Indira Gandhi, continued this tilt toward the USSR, signi\ufb01ed in the",

  "wishing to see India\u2019s power advantages further strengthened in South Asia at the expense of",
  "Pakistan. India\u2019s sense of US hostility was palpable: \u2018the United States Government is still side-",
  "stepping the central issue [Pakistani domestic suppression] and is responding with \ufb02agrant",
  "injustice in attempting to pin the major responsibility for the present con\ufb02ict on India\u2019.8 Indira",
  "Gandhi felt that, \u2018our relationship as a whole has been uneasy over a long period of time. To",
  "our grave concern, U.S. policy as it developed impinged seriously on our vital interests [\u2026] in",

  "though, countered by \ufb01rm diplomatic support and signs of Soviet readiness to deploy its own",

  "The USA saw India as providing assistance to the Soviet deployment from Vladivostok to Viet",
  "Nam and into the Indian Ocean, the so-called \u2018Arc of Crisis\u2019. The unwillingness of India to",
  "denounce the Soviet move into Afghanistan in 1979 was seen as further grounds of di\ufb00erence",

  "beenback in1954. Itsattempts in 1982 toblock US sales toPakistan were unsuccessful:",
  "The US decision to supply sophisticated arms to Pakistan ostensibly as a reaction to the",
  "Soviet intervention in Afghanistan, aroused apprehensions in India. In the past, India had",
  "morethanoncebeenavictimofPakistaniaggression.Thepossibilityoftheintroductionof",
  "a new generation of armaments into the sub-continent, heightened the fears based on past",

  "result [\u2026] The passage of the proposals on the security assistance to Pakistan through the",
  "US Congress which con\ufb01rmed the Administration\u2019s decision, cast a shadow over bilateral",
  "relations which showed no signs of lifting at the year end.14",
  "India continued to be concerned about US (and Chinese) military aid to Pakistan. As for the",
  "USA, it viewed India with coolness at best. In 1992 the US position was that, \u2018we should dis-",

  "Post-Cold War convergence",
  "The post-Cold War period posed new challenges to India and the USA. For India, the break-",
  "up of the USSR in e\ufb00ect removed its previous close ally with which it had a Treaty of Peace,",
  "Friendship and Cooperation, but also removed the ideological battleground that had seen India",
  "tilting towards a USSR with which the USA was in competition. The collapse of the USSR",

  "collapseoftheUSSRhadindeedremovedtheirColdWarfoe,againstwhichithadconstructed",

  "a strategic logic bringing the USA and China together against a common Soviet threat, the",
  "removal of the USSR removed that logic and left China as the emerging rival power to the",
  "USA. India\u2019s own problems with China (territorial disputes and so forth) remained as keen as",
  "ever. India\u2019s own rise in Asia was bringing it increasingly up against an equally (or even more",
  "strongly) rising China. Classic International Relations (IR) balance of power (Kenneth Waltz)",
  "factors would have suggested a China-India balance against the USA. Instead, Stephen Walt-",

  "Clinton\u2019s \u2018Community of Democracies\u2019 providing some of the ideological underpinnings for",
  "this. Some initial steps were signalled in the Agreed Minute on Defense Cooperation, which",
  "was signed in January 1995, a \u2018\ufb01rst important step\u2019 with its talk of \u2018gradually increasing coop-",
  "eration in defense research and production\u2019, which \u2018begins the process for deepening and",
  "strengthening the security relations between India and the United States of America [\u2026] sig-",
  "ni\ufb01cant and really historic because we have now been more than four decades absent that kind",
  "of security relationship\u2019.17 However, the pace was slow. As the US Secretary of Defense, Wil-",
  "liam Perry, put it, \u2018in India, I stressed that arms sales were simply not on the agenda. I did say",
  "that we would look for ways of gradually increasing cooperation in defense research and pro-",
  "duction, but I emphasized that this will not be an area for immediate or bold steps\u2019.18 US",
  "supplies to Pakistan continued, as they still do, to complicate relations with India: \u2018the Gov-",
  "ernment of India deeply regrets [\u2026] the US decision to take no action on the clandestine",
  "acquisitionbyPakistanof5,000ringmagnetsforitsnuclearweaponsprogramme,andindeedto",
  "continue uninterruptedly with its transfer of sophisticated US arms to Pakistan\u2019.19",
  "An important turning point was the election of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in 1998.",
  "Their \ufb01rst decision of substance was to press ahead with nuclear testing, Pokhran-II. The US",
  "response was quick: \u2018this week I want to speak to you about a matter of grave concern to the",
  "United States and the international community, India\u2019s nuclear test explosion. These tests were",
  "unjusti\ufb01ed and threaten to spark a dangerous nuclear arms race in Asia. As a result, and in",
  "accordance with our laws, I have imposed serious sanctions against India, including an end to",
  "our economic assistance, military \ufb01nancing\u2019, albeit lifted by November 1998.20",
  "By then, Atal Bihari Vajpayee had been quick to make a play for stronger Indian-US rela-",
  "tions in September 1998. In his speech, \u2018India, USA and the World\u2019 to the Asia Society he",
  "argued that they were \u2018estranged democracies\u2019, in which US preference for relations with",
  "Pakistan and China had blinded it to the role that India could play. His vision was one where,",
  "\u2018Indo-US ties based on equality and mutuality of interests is going to be the mainstay of",
  "tomorrow\u2019s stable, democratic world order\u2019. The stress on a democratic world order is an",
  "interesting slant pointing not just to US-Indian domestic politics of democratic pluralism, but",
  "also to a more democratic international system, where US unipolarity was giving way to mul-",
  "tipolarity (what some would call the \u2018democratization of international relations\u2019). He went on,",
  "\u2018India and the US are natural allies in the quest for a better future for the world in the 21st",
  "century\u2019. Raja Mohan sees it as \u2018simple in its conception but a breathtaking departure from",
  "India\u2019s traditional foreign policy of non-alignment and anti-American and anti-Western orien-",

  "sensibilities, especially his comments that, \u2018we welcome India\u2019s leadership in the region\u2019, and",
  "\u2018we want to take our partnership to a new level\u2019.22 Amidst the emphasis of democracy and",
  "human rights inspiration of Gandhi in the USA, the economic take-o\ufb00 of India was also a",
  "feature noted by him:",
  "You liberatedyourmarkets, andnowhave oneofthe 10fastestgrowingeconomies inthe",
  "world [\u2026] Americans have applauded your e\ufb00orts to open your economy, your commit-",
  "ment to a new wave of economic reform[; such that] we are proud to support India\u2019s",
  "growth as your largest partner in trade and investment. And we want to see more Indians",
  "and more Americans bene\ufb01t from our economic ties, especially in the cutting \ufb01elds of",
  "informationtechnology,biotechnology,andcleanenergy.Theprivatesectorwilldrivethis",
  "progress.23",
  "What was signi\ufb01cant in this late Clinton setting was that their relationship still seemed to be a",
  "matter of soft power values (democracy, pluralism) and hard power (economics), but with hard",
  "power military-security issues much less evident. A sense of \u2018estranged democracies\u2019 was giving",
  "way to \u2018engaged democracies\u2019.24",
  "Anti-terrorism",
  "One element pulling them closer together was not the state-level challenge of China, but the",
  "transnational threat of terrorism. India for some time had been warning about the dangers of",
  "jihadist acts of violence, erupting across Kashmir during the 1980s but also targeting the rest of",
  "India, as with the Mumbai bombings of 1993 which saw 250 people die. The hijacking of",
  "Indian Airlines IC 814 brought discussion and the setting-up of an Indo-US Joint Working",
  "Group on terrorism in February 2000, wherein the two countries agreed to share experiences,",
  "exchangeinformationandco-ordinateapproachesandaction.25AspartofitsassistancetoIndia,",
  "the USA o\ufb00ered to give anti-terrorism training for inter-departmental co-ordination, crisis",
  "response and consequence management.",
  "Under the presidency of George W. Bush (2001\u201309), the USA faced its own outrages,",
  "notably the terrorist attacks of11 September2001at thehands ofal-Qa\u2019ida. India wasquickto",
  "give full support, including transit facilities, as the USA moved against the Taliban regime in",
  "Afghanistan that hadhosted al-Qa\u2019ida. ManmohanSingh\u2019s visitto the USA in November 2001",
  "gave him the opportunity to express the fullest and strongest support for the USA. The joint",
  "Indian-USstatementnotedthat,\u2018sinceSeptember11,thepeopleoftheUnitedStatesandIndia",
  "have been united as never before in the \ufb01ght against terrorism. In so doing, they have together",
  "rea\ufb03rmed [\u2026] the importance of further transforming the US-India relationship [\u2026] they",
  "noted that both countries are targets of terrorism, as seen in the barbaric attacks on 11th Sep-",
  "tember in the United States and on 1st October in Kashmir\u2019.26 The importance for India was",
  "the linking of Kashmiri \u2018terrorism\u2019 to terrorism elsewhere.",
  "On 20 December 2001, following the attack on the Indian parliament, the USA placed the",
  "Jaish-e-Mohammed and Lashkar-e-Taiba on all three US terrorist lists: the Foreign Terrorist",
  "Organizations (FTO) list, the Specially Designated Global Terrorists (SDGT) list, and the Ter-",
  "rorist Exclusion List. In addition, it called upon Pakistan to take steps to crack down on ter-",
  "rorism emanating from Pakistan, and to take decisive action against Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-",
  "Mohammed and other terrorist organizations, their leaders, \ufb01nances and activities.",

  "India could continue to express concern over US unwillingness to name Pakistan as a \u2018state",
  "sponsor of terrorism\u2019.27 On the one hand, Pakistan\u2019s previous support of the Taliban Govern-",
  "ment had left uncertainties over Pakistan\u2019s position after the terrorist attacks on the USA.",
  "Nevertheless, Pakistan\u2019s position as the immediate front-line state for operations in Pakistan",
  "gave it leverage over the USA, which continued to need Pakistan\u2019s assistance more than it",
  "needed India\u2019s in the immediate e\ufb00orts to curb Taliban and al-Qa\u2019ida operatives in Pakistan.",
  "Potentially, it also enabled Pakistan to try to trade its assistance to the USA over taking action",
  "against Taliban/al-Qa\u2019ida forces in Pakistan for the USA taking a more pro-Pakistan position",
  "over Kashmir.",

  "common anti-jihadist concerns. The fact that the Mumbai bombers had entered India from",
  "Pakistan strengthened India\u2019s attempts to get the USA to distance itself more from Pakistan.",
  "Defence convergence",
  "The most signi\ufb01cant development in recent years has been the convergence between India and",
  "the USA in security-military areas. This has taken India far from the days of Nehru and Indira",
  "Gandhi with their campaigns for non-alignment and for getting the USA out of the Indian",
  "Ocean.",
  "Even as the Clinton Administration was coming to an end, the incoming Republican",
  "Administration under George W. Bush was dreaming of recasting the international system. His",
  "prospective National Security Council (and later Secretary of State) adviser, Condoleezza Rice,",
  "was already talking of constraining China: \u2018China is not a \u201cstatus quo\u201d power but one that",
  "would like to alter Asia\u2019s balance of power in its own favor. That alone makes it a strategic",
  "competitor\u2019 for the USA, but also for India.30 Her take was to note that the USA, \u2018should pay",
  "closer attention to India\u2019s role in the regional balance. There is a strong tendency conceptually",
  "to connect India with Pakistan and to think only of Kashmir or the nuclear competition",
  "between the two states. But India is an element in China\u2019s calculation, and it should be in",
  "America\u2019s, too. India is not a great power yet, but it has the potential to emerge as one\u2019, and",
  "one able to join the USA in balancing China.31",
  "Such strategic logic dominated US-Indian relations during the Bush presidency and was",
  "reciprocated by both BJP- and Congress-led governments in India. By the time of Vajpayee\u2019s",
  "visit to the USA, in the aftermath of the 2001 attacks, India and the USA were talking of",
  "creating a \u2018strategic partnership\u2019 between the two countries. Indian commentators like Ganguly",
  "could talk of \u2018the start of a beautiful friendship\u2019 in 2003, with January 2004 seeing the US-",
  "Indian Next Steps in Strategic Partnership (NSSP) initiative being launched.32 The following",
  "year saw the launching of the Indian-US Global Democracy Initiative (GDI). Such a strategic",
  "convergence was seen by hard-headed Indian commentators as \u2018inevitable\u2019, driven by common",
  "geopoliticalimperativesandcommonbalanceofthreatanalysesdirectedatChina.33NeitherIndia",
  "nor the USA wished to pursue hard containment antagonistic rejection of China; both were",
  "tryingtoengagewithChinawherepossible.However,aspartoftheirmutualhedgingstrategies",
  "towards China both were ready to strengthen their own security relationship, to engage in",
  "elements of unstated but apparent balancing as well towards China. The terminology being",

  "power was indicated in the agreement in 2002 for Indian ships INS Sharda and Sukanya to take",
  "over from the USA in escorting ships through the Straits of Malacca.",
  "With regard to alignment, the key development was the Defence Agreement drawn up in",

  "nuclear energy, with the USA lifting its previous restrictions on nuclear trade, with domestic",
  "and international legislation completed by 2009.",
  "Conclusions",
  "US-India strategic co-operation is set to run into the 21st century.36 The context for this is",
  "India\u2019s rise within the international system. The Indian leadership, looking at the new Barack",
  "Obama Administration, judged that, \u2018the new US Administration has, indeed, focused on con-",
  "tinuity in the bilateral relationship. In this, is the inherent recognition of India\u2019s place in the",
  "world, our regional role, and our demonstrable economic strength and potential\u2019.37 The US",
  "Quadrennial Review (2010) was equally clear about India\u2019s impact:",
  "As the economic power, cultural reach, and political in\ufb02uence of India increase, it is",
  "assuming a more in\ufb02uential role in global a\ufb00airs. This growing in\ufb02uence, combined with",
  "democratic values it shares with the United States, an open political system, and a com-",
  "mitment to global stability, will present many opportunities for cooperation. India\u2019s mili-",
  "tarycapabilitiesarerapidlyimprovingthroughincreaseddefenseacquisitions,andtheynow",
  "include long-range maritime surveillance, maritime interdiction and patrolling, air inter-",
  "diction, and strategic airlift. India has already established its worldwide military in\ufb02uence",
  "through counterpiracy, peacekeeping, humanitarian assistance, and disaster relief e\ufb00orts. As",
  "its military capabilities grow, India will contribute to Asia as a net provider of security in",
  "the Indian Ocean and beyond.38",
  "In geopolitical terms, there seems to be an uno\ufb03cial shift taking place as the USA shores up its",
  "positionintheWesternPaci\ufb01c(e.g.Guam),butstartstostandtoonesidetoseeIndiaassumea",
  "greater role in the Indian Ocean as, indeed, a \u2018net provider of security\u2019.",

  "The rise of China is of course observed with close attention in our region. China\u2019s",
  "demonstrable economic strength and its growing military capabilities are a matter of fact",
  "and we must incorporate such factors into our calculus of the emerging 21st century sce-",
  "nario in the Asia Paci\ufb01c. This is where a mature and evolving dialogue between India and",
  "the United States will be of considerable relevance in clarifying approaches to the regional",
  "situation and the policy approaches of roles of our two countries in these new [China-",
  "related] circumstances.39",
  "However, both partners remain concerned not to forego engagement links with China, with",
  "which they both have bigger trading links.40 India is concerned about the USA playing the",
  "\u2018India card\u2019 to gain concessions from China, before then dropping India, whilst the USA is also",
  "concerned about India playing the \u2018US card\u2019 in order to again concessions from China, before",
  "then dropping the USA.",

  "and the USA as democracies does, however, provide a substantial ideational base for long-term",
  "co-operation, whilst geopolitically their respective spheres and strategic backyards do not parti-",
  "cularly overlap, leading Rao to not inaccurately sum up that, \u2018our collaboration and coopera-",
  "tion will be indispensable for shaping the character of the 21st century\u2019, in which \u2018we share",
  "common values and common strategic interests\u2019.41",
