  "Ajay Dubey",
  "Introduction",
  "India and Africa are two shore neighbours. It is this geographical proximity, India looking",
  "westwards across the navigable Indian Ocean, that made the peoples of the two regions known",
  "to each other. Beginning with early colonial days, the free and voluntary relations of the past",
  "gave way to colonial needs and preferences. The present relations, one between independent,",
  "self-respecting regions, was formally established only after both sides got independence. The",
  "21st century has seen a renewed initiative of India with the India-Africa Forum Summit (IAFS)",
  "in 2008. Some similar initiatives have been taken by other Asian countries, like the People\u2019s",
  "Republic of China, Malaysia and Japan. Many observers call it a \u2018new scramble for Africa\u2019 by",
  "Asian countries to acquire African raw materials and energy resources.1",
  "However, a historical examination of Indo-African relations shows that India\u2019s interest and",
  "intense engagement is not new; it is multidimensional. Africa is a continent consisting of 54",
  "countries and India\u2019s relations with Africa are therefore heterogeneous, complex and diverse.",
  "Nevertheless, this chapter will focus on broader aspects of Indo-African relations, in which",
  "the historical goodwill of India is being translated now into economic and political co-",
  "operation.2 In this context, this chapter will discuss Indo-African relations in distinct phases of",
  "history and then focus on the emerging areas of present engagement between the two",
  "regions.",
  "Historical connections",
  "Shared history embedded in ancient contacts",
  "Contacts between India and Africa can be traced back to ancient times when Indian merchants",
  "from itswestern seaboard traded along the eastern littorals of Africa. TheIndian Ocean was the",
  "connecting factor in this trade relation. The seasonal reversal of monsoon winds in the Indian",
  "Ocean was very helpful for the traders, who utilized it for navigation. The in\ufb02uence of Indian",
  "architecture on the African kingdom shows the level of trade development between the two",

  "(a Greek guidebook for sailors written about 2,000 years ago) mentions that trade existed",
  "between the Indian shores and Africa. Ibn Battuta in his account observes the presence of",
  "AfricansknownashabshisintheimperialarmiesoftheIndianKings.AlargenumberofAfricans",
  "came during medieval times and formed a major section of Muslim armies. They reached the",
  "highest positions in the army and their own forts. They settled along the western coast of India",
  "and were called siddis. This African diaspora in India predates the later indentured diaspora of",
  "India in Africa.",
  "Colonial expansion and strengthening of India-Africa relations",
  "ThephaseofEuropeancolonialexpansioninAfricaandIndia,however,broughtanendtothis",
  "traditional long-range trading system. This period of shared colonial rule led to migration of a",
  "substantial number of Indians, with a large number of People of Indian Origin (PIOs) taken to",
  "African countries in di\ufb00erent capacities\u2014as indentured workers, railway workers, artisans and",
  "slaves. This forced migration was part of the British policy to take Indian labourers all over the",
  "world to replace black slaves after their emancipation. The people of Indian origin not only",
  "greatly contributed to the host country, but also forged an inextricable link between India and",
  "Africa. Indian leaders before independence and later in the Government of India actively",
  "engaged themselves in the cause of PIOs.",
  "It is in Africa that, for the \ufb01rst time, an Indian leader, Mahatma Gandhi, raised the issue",
  "of discrimination of PIOs in a big way. The discriminatory treatment in a racially structured",
  "society of South Africa drew Gandhi into active politics during his stay in Natal in 1893\u20131914.",
  "The period witnessed the \ufb01rst \ufb02owering of his approach of satyagraha, or non-violent resistance",
  "to tyranny. Gandhi\u2019s experience of discrimination in South Africa left an abiding in\ufb02uence",
  "in the identi\ufb01cation of India with the freedom-loving peoples of Africa. His philosophy, which",
  "he successfully put into practice to achieve India\u2019s independence, inspired a generation of",
  "African leaders\u2014including Kwame Nkrumah of Ghana, Obafemi Awolowo of Nigeria, Julius",
  "Nyerere of Tanzania, and Kenneth Kaunda of Zambia\u2014in their own national liberation",
  "campaigns.3",
  "Afro-Asian resurgence, anti-colonialism and anti-racism",
  "While Gandhi was a common icon for Indo-African relations, it was Jawaharlal Nehru who",
  "gave the relationship its political structure. During his time as Prime Minister, Nehru was",
  "instrumental in shaping and de\ufb01ning major policy objectives and commitment to the Afro-",
  "Asianresurgence inwhich IndiaandespeciallyNehru triedtoemerge asaleaderofex-colonial",
  "countries. Under him, India took a de\ufb01nite diplomatic stand on many African issues. First, he",
  "supported the decolonization of African states, which he considered a continuation of India\u2019s",
  "own decolonization. It was largely based on his personal commitment to the process of Afro-",
  "Asian resurgence. Second, he took a \ufb01rm stand against racial discrimination in South Africa and",
  "brokeo\ufb00India\u2019sdiplomaticandtraderelationswiththeracistregime.ForAfricancountriesstill",
  "under colonial rule during this period, both were relevant to Africa\u2019s immediate concerns of",
  "decolonization and democratization. The Bandung Conference (1955) and the Afro-Asian",
  "Peoples Solidarity Conference of Cairo (1958) demonstrated these Afro-Asian perceptions of",
  "each other. India\u2019s engagement with Africa, its diplomacy and interactions in the Non-Aligned",

  "Lookingwest3:Africa",
  "Movement (NAM), the United Nations, the Commonwealth, and Afro-Asian organizations",
  "were mainly on the lines of anti-colonialism and anti-racism. Nehru also took a categorical",
  "stand on issues on people of Indian origin settled in Africa, and made it clear that they must",
  "identify with the local majority community and should not seek any special privilege over the",
  "natives in the country of their adoption.",
  "The low ebb of the 1960s",
  "However, early hopes of a more intensive Indo-African partnership went into a low ebb in the",
  "1960s. Indian policy was unrealistic, overestimating the role Africa was going to play due to its",
  "numerical strength and underestimating the importance and priority which Africans attached to",
  "issues like decolonization and racial equality. India failed to realize that such issues like peaceful",
  "co-existence, highly relevant and important though they were for India, had to be integrated",
  "with African impatience for decolonization. In support for African decolonization, India was",
  "branded as having a softer attitude towards colonial powers. Indian insistence on non-violent",
  "struggles against colonialism, its advocacy of \u2018peaceful co-existence\u2019 and moderate stand on",
  "issues like Mau Mau rebellion, the Algerian war of independence and the Congolese civil war,",
  "did not appeal to Africans. On the other hand, the Chinese militancy and advocacy for armed",
  "struggle did appeal to Africans.4 Furthermore, India\u2019s Anglo-centric view resulted in no time",
  "limit being \ufb01xed for colonial withdrawal,5 and the gulf caused between Indian settlers and",
  "Africans by colonialist propaganda that India was attempting to end white domination to",
  "replaceitwithIndians,broughtdi\ufb00erencesoutintotheopen.DuringtheIndo\u2013ChineseWarof",
  "1962 India was isolated; very few African countries supported India and many adopted an",
  "openly unhelpful attitude.6 The Cairo Conference of Non-Aligned Countries (1964) exposed",
  "Indian isolation, with Africa taking the dominant control of the NAM.7",
  "Theresult ofthiswasthatbythemid-1960sIndia\u2019sadvantages asabeaconofdecolonization",
  "in Africa, as one of the founders of the NAM and a leader of Afro-Asian resurgence, had been",
  "let down during Indo\u2013Chinese War by those very peoples whose demands it had championed.",
  "The situation for India became more alarming when it observed that African countries",
  "belonging and professing to non-aligned groups were ready to accept Chinese claims and ver-",
  "sions of events.",
  "The issue of India\u2019s policy towards Indian settlers in Africa was another factor that did not",
  "augur well with African leaders. India had taken the exclusive issue of the discrimination of",
  "Indian settlers in South Africa to the UN. Blacks, who su\ufb00ered worse discrimination in",
  "South Africa, were initially not included in the Indian resolution moved in the UN under",
  "Article 10 of the UN Charter. This caused great misgivings in Africans. Admittedly, Nehru",
  "had made it clear that \u2018in many parts of Africa \u2013 East, West, South \u2013 there are considerable",
  "number of Indians, mostly business people. Our de\ufb01nite instructions to them and to our",
  "agent in Africa are that they must always put the interest of indigenous population \ufb01rst. We",
  "want to have no vested interests at the expense of population of those countries\u2019.8 However,",
  "in the aftermath of the Chinese attack of 1962 he talked of the \u2018dual loyalty\u2019 of Indian",
  "settlers in Africa. They were supposed to stand up beside India when India was in crisis.9",
  "During the 1964 Africa Safari, Indira Gandhi also called these overseas Indian settlers",
  "\u2018Ambassadors of India\u2019.",

  "a model for development.",
  "Under these changed domestic and international circumstances, Indo-African relations",
  "showed noticeable changes compared with the earlier period. The most important change was",
  "in the \ufb01eld of India\u2019s economic diplomacy towards the African states. The ever-growing",
  "industry and need to keep its balance of trade kept Indian economic diplomacy at the forefront",
  "of its foreign policy. Therefore, economic diplomacy, a secondary objective to the political",
  "imperatives of the 1960s, became the primary objective by the 1970s. The previous policy to",
  "make friends in Africa and to gain their diplomatic support on various issues shifted to the",
  "creation and cultivation of gainful economic links. This was in tandem with the increasing",
  "realization among developing countries of the need for economic co-operation under a south-",
  "southumbrella.IndiautilizeditsdiplomaticstrengthininternationalforumsliketheUN,NAM",
  "and \u2018Group of 77\u2019, to develop south-south co-operation. Both the African states and India",
  "underlined the need for economic co-operation among themselves. It was at the Lusaka",
  "Summit (1970) that the Indian Prime Minister, Indira Gandhi, articulated and gave the call for",
  "south-south co-operation. She pledged Indian technology and human resources for this. Poli-",
  "tically, by the early 1970s most of the African colonies had become independent except Rho-",
  "desia, Namibia and South Africa. For the newly independent countries, the priority was to",
  "consolidate their freedom by accelerating economic development.",
  "Ontheissueofthestruggleforliberation,IndiaworkedcloselywiththeAfricancountriesin",

  "the African National Congress (ANC) in 1967 and the South-West African People\u2019s Organi-",
  "zation (SWAPO) in 1985. Apart from diplomatic support, it added material assistance, but the",
  "material assistance remained meagre due to India\u2019s own limitation on giving more in those",

  "In the 1970s, on the issue of the Indian diaspora, Indira Gandhi advanced a policy of",

  "Alongside such multilateral UN frameworks, India has been involved in its own bilateral mili-",

  "military training institutions, having thus to send its military o\ufb03cers abroad for training. Since",
  "the 1960s India has provided military training to a number of African countries, primarily from",
  "Anglophone Africa. The training covers \ufb01elds such as security and strategic studies, defence",

  "Given the fact that the African east coast is in India\u2019s strategic maritime neighbourhood, India",

  "strategic terms, it could serve as a small base between India and the important shipping lanes of",
  "Mozambique.",
  "India currently provides maritime security for AU island states like Mauritius and the Sey-",
  "chelles. Their logic has been mutual interests, as India\u2019s naval chief Arun Prakash explained:",

  "EEZ, increasingly under threat from Somalia-based pirates.26",
  "Thus it was that the four-ship, two-month deployment in August\u2013September 2010 of INS",
  "Mysore, INS Tabar, INS Ganga and INS Aditya involved them carrying out anti-piracy",
  "duties, patrolling the EEZs of the Seychelles and Mauritius, and visiting Kenya, Tanzania and",
  "Mozambique, before participating in the IBSAMAR trilateral exercises in South African",

  "Conclusions",
  "India and the African countries are devising new parameters for an enhanced and enlarged",
  "relationship appropriate to their new role in a changing world. This new dimension in the",
  "India-Africa relationship has been a response to the challenge of globalization, and what has",
  "emerged is immense opportunities for mutually bene\ufb01cial co-operation.",
  "The model of co-operation into which India and the African countries are entering has",
  "emerged from the success of the IAFS held in New Delhi in April 2008. The co-operation",
  "mechanism is clearly one seeking mutual bene\ufb01t through a consultative process. India does not",
  "wish to demand certain rights or projects in Africa; however, it wants to contribute to the",
  "achievement of Africa\u2019s development objectives as devised by African partners. Besides the",
  "consultative process and the spirit of friendship, sharing knowledge and experience is another",
  "aspect that makes many African countries relate to India. Thesharing of experience on political",
  "institutions and human resources development is an important aspect of India\u2019s non-intrusive",

  "support to the development of democratic institutions in many African countries. Such factors",
  "may indeed give India the \u2018advantage over China\u2019 in their simultaneous, and fairly competitive,",
  "presence in Africa.27",
  "The introduction of multilateralism into Indian-African relations through a multi-tiered co-",
  "operative partnership framework has brought transparency in decision-making and re\ufb02ects",
  "India\u2019s respect for its African partners. Out of the substantial funds committed for capacity",
  "building in Africa at the 2008 IAFS, one-half will be channelled through AU-led decisions",
  "and a similar amount is committed to the bilateral and regional tiers. The action through the",
  "AU was concretized through the announcement of a Joint Action Plan in March 2010, in",
  "which India shared the decision-making on the allocation of resources, the creation of train-",
  "ing programmes and the establishment of 19 institutions in Africa with the AU Commission",
  "and member states. This is an important feature of India\u2019s new model of engagement with",
  "Africa.",
  "Indian-Africanrelationsovertheyearshavewitnessedvariouschanges,movingfromaperiod",
  "of high political, emotional and moral solidarity, to a more material, concrete and develop-",
  "mental approach. Indo-African diplomatic relations by the mid-1960s had reached a very low",
  "ebb.IndianpolicywasunrealisticinperceivingboththeroleAfricawasgoingtoplayduetoits",
  "numerical strength and sense of solidarity, and the importance and priority that Africans",
  "attached to issues like decolonization and racial equality, though India provided increasing",
  "support to African liberation movements both for decolonization and an end to racism. During",
  "the early period, India\u2019s support was not strong in material terms. Although during the 1970s",
  "and1980s material assistance wasadded to Indiandiplomatic e\ufb00orts, they remained meagredue",
  "to India\u2019s own limitation for giving more in those terms. However, diplomatic alertness and",
  "initiative were so vigorously pursued that they bridged the gap of material assistance and pro-",
  "jected India as a champion and uncompromising \ufb01ghter against colonialism and racism. How-",
  "ever,althoughIndiandiplomacydidsucceedin\ufb01llingthegapsinIndiandesiresanditse\ufb00ective",
  "role in African liberation struggles, how far did it actually succeed in providing a coherence to",
  "India\u2019s economic relations within the emerging south-south concept?",
  "India had added an economic dimension to its diplomacy and policy toward Africa by the",
  "mid-1960s. Selective and aggressive initiatives for friendship through economic diplomacy did",
  "help India, and through its ITEC and other programmes, India started to counter the growing",
  "Chinese economic diplomacy in the Third World, a competition which has re-emerged in",
  "recent years in Africa. Under the umbrella of the NAM, this economic focus became the main",
  "policy driver forIndia,and otherdiplomaticendeavours became supportiveandadjunct to itin",
  "Africa.However,theeconomicrelationsthatemergedinthecontextofIndianinitiativesinthe",
  "umbrella of south-south links were not very equitable, at least in trade. Indo-African growing",
  "trends in economic areas demand that in the light of India\u2019s past experiences, India should be",
  "sensitive to African concerns and expectations.",
  "The current interactions call for partnership and south-south solidarity, and focus on eco-",
  "nomic empowerment and sustainable development in Africa. They show signs of both",
  "expanding and deepening, but if the growing trends under the Indian private sector in Indo-",
  "African economic relations do not distinguish themselves qualitatively from north-south rela-",
  "tions, then it will create problems for Indian moves in Africa. The economic relations of India",
  "with Africa under globalization are gainful for India, but they have to be qualitatively di\ufb00erent",
  "from north-south relations as far as African perceptions are concerned. The question remains:",
  "can India translate its historical and cultural goodwill along with its credentials as a fast devel-",
