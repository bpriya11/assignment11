  "Manmohan Singh (2004\u2013present) this has been complemented by a westwards shift, a \u2018Look",
  "West\u2019 policy to engage with Iran and the Arabian/Persian (depending on whose side one was",

  "The role of extra-regional powers in the region has been long running. After the Second",

  "1971, with the USA then assuming the responsibility of defending pro-Western governments.",
  "During the Cold War the USSR had its geopolitical vision (along with the USA) of access to",

  "AftertheSovietcollapse,IndiasawnewmarketsavailableintheGulf(andIran)toengagewith",
  "economically. Meanwhile the USA built up its military strength in the region, so as to support",
  "its own economic interests in the region. In order to enhance the mobility of US forces and to",
  "provide logistical support, additional base facilities were sought and acquired in Oman and",
  "Bahrain. Today the USA has a presence in every country of the Gulf apart from Iran, some-",
  "thing of a Pax Americana within which Indian interests (have to?) operate.2 Apart from defend-",

  "The Gulf",
  "India and the relations with the Gulf are very old, and can be traced back to ancient times in",
  "both the cultural and economic domains. Relations \ufb02ourished with more maritime links with",
  "theregion,whichwerecarriedoutbyvarioustradersfromIndiaaswellasfromtheGulf.They",
  "dominated Gulf maritime trade before the Europeans arrived in the early 19th century, and",
  "made it their ground of con\ufb02icts and opportunities. Meanwhile, India had also fallen under the",
  "sway of British control. On the one hand, the volume of trade between the Gulf and India",
  "diminished;onotherhand,theBritishpresenceintheGulfwastosomeextentcontrolledfrom",
  "British India and underpinned by manpower from British India. In political terms, British for-",
  "eign policy in the Gulf was carried out through the Persian Gulf Residency (PGR). Before",
  "1857thePGRhadbeenasubdivisionoftheEastIndiaCompany,whilstfrom1858onwardsit",
  "came under the jurisdiction of the British India administration. In economic terms the Indian",
  "rupee was also the currency used in Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, the Trucial States and Oman, as",
  "provided by the Reserve Bank of India up to 1959. In military terms, Indian manpower was",
  "mobilized in the Second World War and deployed in Bahrain, and in large numbers (around",
  "700,000) in Kuwait and Mesopotamia.",
  "Post-independence, India revitalized its historical links with the Gulf region, with its \u2018strate-",
  "gic\u2019 signi\ufb01cance increasingly recognized by India.4 Pranab Mukherjee encapsulated India\u2019s eco-",
  "nomicandpoliticalconcernsintheGulf:\u2018beyondtheimmediateregion,Indiahasvitalinterests",
  "in the Gulf [\u2026] the Gulf forms parts of our strategic [extended] neighbourhood\u2019, as an",
  "\u2018important source of energy, home to over 3.5m. Indians, and a major trading partner. Parts of",
  "it are also a source of ideology, funding and recruits to the cause of Islamic radicalism and ter-",
  "rorism\u2019.5SuchhasbeenIndia\u2019s pushintothe GulfthatHarsh Pantargues that\u2018theinternational",
  "community and the West in particular has been obsessed with New Delhi\u2019s ties with Tehran",
  "and has tended to ignore India\u2019s much more substantive engagement with the Arab Gulf states",
  "[\u2026] the signi\ufb01cant stakes that India has in the Arab Gulf often go unnoticed\u2019.6 India\u2019s interests",
  "and presence in the Gulf revolve around various issues, namely the expatriate Indian commu-",
  "nity, economic-energy links, and maritime security-diplomacy.",
  "Indian expatriates in the Gulf",
  "When it comes to any con\ufb02ict in the Gulf, India faces a major challenge because of its depen-",
  "dence on energy sources, and the safety and security of Indian migrants in the region. The",
  "discovery ofoil and manpower shortages in the Gulf precipitated phenomenal labour migration",
  "to the region. Given the population pressure and bleak economic prospects at home, Indian",
  "labourers \ufb02ocked to the Gulf in search of employment and higher wages. The presence of",
  "Indian labourers dates to 1935 when the Bahrain Petroleum Company (BAPCO), imported",
  "labour from India. Indians now comprise the largest expatriate community in the Gulf coun-",
  "tries, which counts more than 3m. in the region, distributed accordingly between the United",
  "Arab Emirates (UAE, around 1.5m.), Oman (0.6m.), Kuwait (0.6m.), Bahrain (0.3m.), Qatar",
  "(0.2m.), with another 1.4m. in Saudi Arabia. About one-third (33.3%), and over 42.5% of the",
  "workforce, in the UAE are Indians.",
  "Two comparative trends can be seen.7 First, unlike in the 1970s and 1980s when nearly 90%",
  "of Indians in the Gulf were blue-collar workers, today over 35% of the Indian expatriate",
  "workforce are white-collar professionals specializing in fast-moving \ufb01elds such as the services",
  "and information industry. India\u2019s economic high-tech rise is re\ufb02ected in the increasingly high-",
  "level economic appearance of Indians in the Gulf, where professionals and technically quali\ufb01ed",

  "MukundNarvenkar",
  "Indians are engaged in huge numbers in the knowledge-based economic sectors such as Dubai",
  "Internet City, Dubai Media City and the Jebel Ali Free Zone (JAFZ). Second, unlike in other",
  "regions, Indian expatriates in the Gulf have a higher propensity to remit the money they earn.",
  "Gulf expatriates account for almost 30% of total remittances \ufb02owing back to India. It thus has",
  "become important that India maintains cordial relations with the Gulf countries and fosters",
  "general stability, so that there is no hindrance to such Indian economic activities in the Gulf.",
  "Economics and energy",
  "In the wake of economic reforms in India, and subsequent economic growth in the late 1990s,",
  "Gulf countries showed greater interest in strengthening their bilateral and commercial relations",
  "with India. Apart from the oil and gas market, Indian companies have established various ven-",
  "tures in di\ufb00erent sectors such as management and consultancy services, construction projects,",
  "telecommunications, computer software and hardware engineering, manufacturing of detergent",
  "and pharmaceuticals. One basic complementarity was apparent: \u2018I see India\u2019s requirement for",
  "energy security and that of the Gulf countries for food security as opportunities that can be",
  "leveraged to mutual advantage\u2019.8 A framework agreement for economic co-operation was",
  "signed between India and the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) in August 2004. March 2006",
  "saw the \ufb01rst joint ministerial meeting of the six-state GCC and India. Final negotiations for a",
  "Free Trade Agreement were started in January 2006, and set for signature in 2010.9 Some",
  "Indian commentators argue that \u2018it is time for India to look beyond trade and business, and",
  "engage the GCC in political, security and strategic \ufb01elds\u2019.10 The Gulf region has increased in",
  "relative economic importance for India. Bilateral trade between India and the GCC countries",
  "exceeded US $100,000m. in 2009 making GCC, as a bloc, India\u2019s largest trading partner.",
  "Within that, India-UAE trade of $7,190m. in 2003/04, a 5.6% share of India\u2019s overall trade,",
  "increased to $48,270m. in 2008/09, a 9.87% share of India\u2019s trade, though dropping back",
  "slightly to $43,470m. in 2009/10, or a 9.31% share of India\u2019s trade.",
  "Energy requirements are the main area of exposure for India in the region, where \u2018a pattern",
  "of interdependence is emerging between India and the GCC due to their strategic position and",
  "central role in the current energy security discourse\u2019.11 Quite simply, \u2018the Gulf countries are",
  "crucial to the energy requirements of India, particularly oil\u2019.12 One-third of the world petro-",
  "leum reserves are in the Gulf. With the growth of the shore oil and gas industry, there has",
  "arisen an interest in its military utility and its defence. In the Gulf Wars of the 1980s, 1991 and",
  "2003 there were naval clashes around oil rigs. Availability of oil in the Persian Gulf region has",
  "been the main factor responsible for enhancing the strategic importance of this region. Most of",
  "the Indian requirement for oil and gas was imported from the Persian Gulf. In this energy set-",
  "ting, India\u2019s ONGC Videsh Limited (OVL) has a 100% exploration share of Qatar\u2019s Najwat",
  "Najem \ufb01eld, and a 100% share of Iraq\u2019s Block 8 \ufb01eld.",
  "Maritime security and maritime diplomacy",
  "India\u2019s economic sea trade route has been laid down in history. All the treasures of the ancient",
  "and modern world were borne across the warm waters that stretch from the Arabian Peninsula",
  "to the shores of India. In the global strategic environment, India is an up-and-coming country",
  "with its fast-growing economy, stable democratic policies and expanding maritime dominion.",
  "The world order has started to change from Europe-centric to Asia-centric, with India as a",
  "major player in the region, with more responsibility for securing the SLOCs, which are the",
  "lifeline of India\u2019s constant economic growth.",

  "ism] is not just from across the border in Pakistan but extends beyond to the Middle-East also.",
  "We have to rede\ufb01ne what cross-border terrorism means\u2019.13 Terror operatives in the Gulf have",
  "had a far more signi\ufb01cant role in orchestrating several of the recent terror attacks in India than",
  "was known until recently: funding the serial blasts in Bangalore in 2008; assisting in the escape",
  "of its mastermind, Tadiyantavide Naseer, to Bangladesh; and probably playing a signi\ufb01cant role",
  "in the Mumbai terrorist attacks on 26 November 2008.14 The terrorist attacks on Mumbai in",
  "2008 raised many questions about the security of the sea routes, given that terrorists entered",
  "from across the Arabian Sea. As a country with strong maritime forces in the region, India has",
  "to maintain a close maritime watch in the region for the safe passage of international maritime",
  "trade. The Indian Minister of Defence, A.K. Anthony, commented, whilst inaugurating an",

  "to combat potential terrorist threats in the future.",
  "As an emerging maritime power, from New Delhi\u2019s perspective, key security considerations",
  "include maintaining the accessibility of the Arabian Sea and \ufb02ows into and out of the Strait of",

  "ruled by the Median, Achaemenid, Seleucid and Parthian Empires and later by the Sassanid",
  "Empire. During the period of the Sassanid Empire, Persia and north-western India (which was",
  "ruled by the Kushans and then Kushano-Sassanians) were deeply engaged in political, eco-",
  "nomic, cultural and religious intercourse. The coming of Islam brought further Iranian in\ufb02u-",
  "ences into India, including the widespread and long-running presence of Persian as a widely",
  "used language at the medieval and Mughal courts in India. In modern, post-colonial times,",
  "geographical proximity and economic complementarities have thrown open fresh opportunities",
  "for greater interaction between India and Iran.",
  "The geostrategic importance of Iran in the Gulf is vital for India as it connects the Gulf to",
  "the Arabian Sea through its narrow Strait of Hormuz. Besides this, Iran is a growing regional",
  "player with a drive to acquire nuclear weapons. Iran shares coastlines along the Gulf to the",
  "south and the Caspian Sea to the north, with signi\ufb01cant energy reserves in both areas. Since",
  "Iran is a major regional player, its foreign policy objective in the Gulf and in its immediate",
  "region of the Arabian Sea will have crucial implications for the security of the entire region,",
  "and for India. Indo-Iranian relations can be explained from their political, economic and stra-",
  "tegic aspects.",
  "Political aspects of Indo-Iranian relations",
  "The relationship between India and Iran is far-reaching and multidimensional. The two states",
  "have recognized that they have a lot more to share and o\ufb00er to one another. Their strategic",
  "partnership emerged in the \ufb01rst decade of the 21st century. The visit of Indian Prime Minister",

  "vergence does not detract from the concerns that India continues to have over Iran\u2019s theocratic",
  "and potentially unstable domestic political regime.22",
  "Economic aspects of Indo-Iranian relations",
  "India and Iran have had economic interactions with each other since time immemorial, from",
  "the ancient trade in cotton, textiles, indigo and food grains like rice, Malabar pepper, carda-",
  "mom, ginger, cinnamon and coconut, to modern world trade like oil and gas. Post-1947 India",
  "had substantial economic links with the Shah\u2019s Iran, though the turmoil of the 1979 Iranian",

  "plementarity:",
  "Iran is a country extremely important to India from the perspective of energy security.",

  "Strategic aspects of Indo-Iranian relations",
  "The role of Pakistan in Indo-Iranian relations",
  "Pakistan lies in between India and Iran. As such, it can make or break the proposed IPI gas",
  "pipeline, which is one reason why alternatives have been sought by India and Iran.28 Pakistan",
  "also lies athwart the maritime routes between Iran and India, and is potentially able to disrupt",
  "them. Generally (Sunni) Pakistan has had bad relations with both India and (Shi\u2019a) Iran. Such",

  "been against Pakistan\u2019s involvement and in\ufb02uence in Afghanistan through the Pakistani Inter-",
  "Services Intelligence (ISI) links with the Taliban.",
  "BothIran andIndia have concerns over the roleof Gwadar,which was builtas adeep water",
  "port with signi\ufb01cant Chinese \ufb01nancial assistance. Its location near the mouth of the Gulf and at",
  "the opposite end of the strategic choke points of the Strait of Hormuz and the Gulf of Oman",
  "enhances its strategic importance. Iran\u2019s concerns are economic, with Gwadar\u2019s potential as a",
  "rival to Iran\u2019s nearby deep water port of Chabahar. India\u2019s concerns are partly energy-related.",
  "Since India\u2019s growing need for energy, supplied from the Gulf and Iran via the Arabian Sea,",
  "the dangers of being blocked by Pakistan operating out of Gwadar become of concern for",
  "New Delhi, since Pakistan\u2019s Navy would \ufb01nd it easier to operate closer to the Gulf. Other",
  "military concerns are also in play for India. During times of crisis, in the event of a war with",
  "India, the port of Gwadar would provide strategic depth to Pakistan\u2019s commercial and military",
  "vessels,withthe Pakistani navyableto moveitsnaval assets awayfrom any Indiannaval andair",
  "threat. In addition to Pakistani threats out of Gwadar, India also has further concerns about",

  "Gulf of Aden operations using Gwadar as a berthing and resupply port during operations in",

  "India\u2019s involvement with Iran has brought sustained Indian interest in building up Chabahar.",
  "India\u2019s Minister of External A\ufb00airs was clear enough in summer 2010 on its wider implications:",
  "I would like to mention, in particular, the Chabahar Port Project, and the need for accel-",
  "erating our joint e\ufb00orts to fully realize the potential of the Port as well as the associated",
  "railway project. These are projects that are in the common interest of India, Iran and",
  "Afghanistan, but also the countries of Central Asia. Improving the connectivity of Chaba-",
  "har Port to the Zaranj\u2013Delaram Highway (which was built with Indian assistance despite",
  "terrorist threats and with the sacri\ufb01ce of Indian and Afghan lives, and has transformed the",
  "economy of Nimroz Province in Afghanistan) [\u2026] will help India transport its goods [\u2026]",
  "to Afghanistan, Central Asia and beyond. This project is thus at the heart of the common",
  "vision that India and Iran have for Afghanistan and the region as a whole, of increased and",
  "easier \ufb02ow of goods, and creation of a network of transport routes and energy pipelines.31",
  "Pakistan\u2019s role is the notable absence, with Iran\u2019s Chabahar (backed by India) serving as a rival",
  "toPakistan\u2019sGwadar(backedbyChina).Consequently,India,IranandAfghanistanarekeento",
  "have access to new sea and road routes through Iranian ports. This development will give",
  "straight access to Indian goods to Central Asian markets through Afghanistan and Iran.",
  "Another Central Asia-related aspect of India\u2019s relations with Iran is with the International",
  "North-South Corridor (INSC) pipeline route. This was \ufb02agged up in the Tehran Declaration:",
  "They [India, Iran] agreed to accelerate the process of working out an appropriate scheme",
  "for the pipeline options and \ufb01nalising the agreement reached on LNG. The sides rea\ufb03rm",
  "their commitment to strengthen transport and transit cooperation. In this context and in",
  "line with the proper implementation of Inter-governmental Agreement of International",
  "North-South Corridor between Iran, India and Russia and Agreement on International",
  "Transit of goods between Iran, India and Turkmenistan. They agree to encourage the",
  "businessmen and traders of the two countries to better utilise the said corridors.32",

  "Iran\u2019s quest for nuclear \u2018power\u2019",
  "Iran\u2019s quest for nuclear power involves Iran\u2019s claims that it is merely trying to develop nuclear",
  "energy, amidst suspicions that it is seeking nuclear capacity in order to develop nuclear weap-",
  "ons. Although Iran is a member of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), UN inspec-",
  "tors have found enriched uranium in environment samples, increasing US suspicion that Iran is",
  "developingnuclearweapons.AlthoughtheIranianGovernmenthadcategorically ruledoutany",

  "cratic nationalists who have been ruling Iran for over two decades. This all poses problems for",
  "India amidst a US drive to have tougher and tougher sanctions imposed on Iran, and talk of",
  "possible military action. The USA has been wary, indeed concerned, about Indian links with",
  "Iran.33 US hostility towards Iran places India in the awkward position of having contradictory",
  "pressures from its two strategic partnerships: that with the USA and that with Iran. It is a deli-",
  "cate and uncomfortable \u2018tightrope\u2019 along which India has to walk.34",

  "To some extent India has given way to such US pressure. On the grounds of being a",

  "vote, India voted to hold Iran in \u2018non-compliance\u2019 of its safeguards obligation, when major",

  "argued in parliament that \u2018India\u2019s vote on the IAEA does not, in any way, detract from the",

  "in the following IAEA vote in February 2006, when India voted in favour of referring Iran to",
  "the UN Security Council, due to its apprehension of Iran\u2019s growing uranium enrichment cap-",
  "ability leading to the development of nuclear weapons. However, there has been some distan-",
  "cing subsequently by India. Amidst talk of further sanctions in 2010, India demurred:36",
  "All concerned should adopt a \ufb02exible approach to achieve a comprehensive solution to all",
  "issues. India has always supported dialogue and avoidance of confrontation. The IAEA",
  "continues to provide the best framework for addressing technical issues related to the Ira-",
  "nian nuclear programme. We are justi\ufb01ably concerned that the extra-territorial nature of",
  "certain unilateral sanctions recently imposed by individual countries [the USA], with their",
  "restrictions on investment by third countries [India] in Iran\u2019s energy sector, can have a",
  "direct and adverse impact on Indian companies and more importantly, on our energy",
  "security and our attempts to meet the development needs of our people.37",
  "India could play a very important role between Iran and the Western powers, making the case",
  "for peaceful dialogue, but the question is, does India have any real say in Iran\u2019s nuclear pro-",
  "gramme, and will the USA/Western powers take India into consideration when pursuing any",
  "peace process with Iran? This is a worrying situation wherein India has to be able to convince",
  "the Western powers as well as Iran\u2014the two mutual enemies, but both partners with India.",
  "AnyfuturemilitaryescalationbetweentheUSA(possiblyincludingIsrael) andIranwillputthe",
  "region and India\u2019s interest into jeopardy.",
  "Conclusions",
  "India, Iran and the Gulf region are likely to become increasingly interconnected. Both India",
  "and Iran may need to readjust or consider their relations in the context of the pulls and pres-",
  "sures experienced in their respective relationships with other players. Energy is going to play a",
  "very important role in building new relationships with India and the Gulf. Economic bene\ufb01ts,",
