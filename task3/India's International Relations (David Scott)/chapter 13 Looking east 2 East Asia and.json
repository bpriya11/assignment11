  "India\u2019s role in the broader Asia-Paci\ufb01c region is not one that is widely recognized\u2014even by",
  "some regional specialists. For example, in a recent academic text on the politics of the region,",
  "India merits only a few passing references and is described merely as a country that \u2018interacts",
  "with the Asia-Paci\ufb01c in various ways\u2019.1 Although it would be a signi\ufb01cant mistake to overlook",
  "or discount the role that India is playing in this region, such omissions are somewhat under-",

  "Going beyond South East Asia",
  "The desire to play a signi\ufb01cant role in Asia certainly existed among India\u2019s post-independence",
  "leadership. As Jawaharlal Nehru argued in the mid-1940s, \u2018the Paci\ufb01c is likely to take the place",
  "of the Atlantic in the future as the nerve centre of the world. Though not directly a Paci\ufb01c",
  "state, India will inevitably exercise an important in\ufb02uence there\u2019.3 However, with India",
  "embroiled by internal security challenges, external con\ufb02icts with Pakistan and China, and con-",
  "strained by the so-called Hindu rate of growth, it would be several decades before Nehru\u2019s",
  "words could be legitimately echoed by his successors. Yet, in 2002 Prime Minister Vajpayee",
  "could declare that \u2018India\u2019s belonging to the Asia Paci\ufb01c community is a geographical fact and a",
  "political reality\u2019, and that the region was \u2018one of the focal points of India\u2019s foreign policy, stra-",
  "tegic concerns and economic interests\u2019.4",
  "AfteritsinitialsuccesswiththeAssociationofSoutheastAsianNations(ASEAN),Indiamoved",
  "into phase two of its \u2018Look East\u2019 policy, which encompasses a region \u2018extending from Australia",
  "to East Asia\u2019.5 Indian o\ufb03cials envisioned playing \u2018an ever-increasing role\u2019 in this extended neigh-",
  "bourhood that had been further extended still further eastwards. Simultaneously, India expanded",
  "the range of issues on which it would engage East Asian nations from trade to wider economic",
  "and security issues, representing a further \u2018strategic shift in India\u2019s vision\u2019, one predicated on the",
  "understanding that \u2018developments in East Asia are of direct consequence to India\u2019s security and",
  "development\u2019.6 India\u2019s engagement with this broader region is a foreign policy priority that has",
  "been embraced by successive Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Congress governments.",
  "In some respects, perceptions that India has not traditionally been part of the Asia-Paci\ufb01c",
  "region could actually work to its advantage. While historical animosity colours the bilateral",
  "relations of many nations in the region, India is free from such baggage. Furthermore, in a part",
  "of the world where rival claims to maritime zones and border disputes are widespread, Delhi",
  "lacks any outstanding territorial disputes with the nations of the region. Despite Chinese e\ufb00orts",
  "to curtail its in\ufb02uence, India gained political acceptance in its bid to be recognized as an Asia-",
  "Paci\ufb01c power in 2005 when it was invited to attend the inaugural East Asian Summit (EAS)\u2014",
  "an e\ufb00ort some believed would be the stepping stone to the formation of an East Asian Com-",
  "munity (EAC) to mirror the European Community.7 Support for India\u2019s inclusion in the EAS",
  "\u2018to serve as a counterbalance to China\u2019 came from South-East Asian nations such as Singapore,",
  "IndonesiaandThailand,aswellasfromJapan andtheRepublicofKorea(SouthKorea)\u2014allof",
  "which championed India\u2019s participation despite objections from China.8 While some Indian",
  "commentators view their nation\u2019s inclusion in Asia-Paci\ufb01c regional forums as \u2018a recognition of",
  "[India\u2019s] fast growing economic and political clout\u2019; analysts taking a realistic view of events in",
  "Asia recognize that India was not invited to attend the EAS based on its economy alone, but",
  "also to prevent Beijing from dominating the institution.9 In looking east beyond South-East",

  "expanded trade ties, as well as a foreign policy and security dialogue that promotes bilateral",
  "defence co-operation.10",
  "Given that both states fought wars with China and face signi\ufb01cant security challenges from",
  "revisionist \u2018partitioned\u2019 neighbours, it may be surprising that India\u2019s burgeoning relationship",
  "with South Korea is one that is driven by economics and common interests rather than geo-",
  "graphy or deep historical ties. In the early 1990s South Korea was actually one of the \ufb01rst",
  "countries to respond to India\u2019s attempts to open its economy to East Asia. There has been an",
  "average annual growth rate of 23.5% for more than a decade and a half. From a meagre",

  "South Korean leaders announced a joint goal of expanding bilateral trade to $30,000m. by",
  "2014. Towards that end, after three and a half years of negotiation, a free trade agreement",
  "(FTA) between India and South Korea, called the Comprehensive Economic Partnership",

  "FDI in India. The $12,000m. project undertaken by South Korean steel giant Posco at Paradip",
  "in Orissa to construct an integrated mining and steel production plant is the single largest for-",
  "eign investment in India ever, as well as the largest foreign investment ever undertaken by a",
  "South Korean \ufb01rm.",
  "Although not as extensive as their economic co-operation, Indo-South Korean ties have",
  "extended into the military realm as well. India conducted joint naval exercises with the South",
  "Korean navy in 2000, 2004 and again in 2006. Although often overlooked, the South Korean",
  "Navy possesses a sizeable complement of surface combatants and submarines, comparable to",
  "the navies of France and the United Kingdom. May 2007 marked the \ufb01rst ever visit by a",
  "South Korean defence minister to India. This was coupled with expanded political ties as",
  "New Delhi and Seoul established a \u2018long-term co-operative partnership for peace and pros-",
  "perity\u2019 that is intended to take Indo-Korean relations to \u2018a higher level\u2019. The framework",
  "included economic co-operation and expanded trade ties, as well as a foreign policy and",
  "security dialogue that promotes bilateral defence co-operation. The two sides also signed a",
  "Memorandum of Understanding on joint defence production with the possibility of colla-",
  "boration on self-propelled guns, armoured vehicles and smaller naval vessels such as mine-",
  "sweepers and frigates.",
  "From a geostrategic perspective, Seoul and New Delhi are beginning to \ufb01nd a convergence",
  "of interests in key areas. Some of this is China-related. Seoul is particularly concerned that",
  "China\u2019s on-going military build-up will enable it to dominate the sea lanes of the South China",
  "Sea\u2014a development that would signi\ufb01cantly undercut South Korea\u2019s political independence",
  "from its giant neighbour. As a result, Seoul has actively supported India\u2019s naval presence in",
  "maritime Asia to o\ufb00set China\u2019s regional power. Despite Chinese opposition, South Korea has",
  "championedIndia\u2019sinclusioninEastAsianregionalforumsliketheEAS.NewDelhiandSeoul",
  "are also united in their concerns about the proliferation of nuclear weapons and missile tech-",

  "shared interests in restraining the scope of China\u2019s in\ufb02uence in Asia, as well as their \u2018deep",
  "interest in tackling regional and global security challenges\u2019, have led to a strengthening of",
  "increasingly signi\ufb01cant defence ties that one overly exuberant South Asian commentator",
  "has termed an \u2018Asia-Paci\ufb01c alliance between India and Japan\u2019.12 Although it has been increas-",
  "ingly common to focus on China as the leading power in East Asia, it should not be forgotten",
  "that Japan\u2019s economy is larger than China\u2019s (though being overtaken in 2010) or India\u2019s and,",
  "with a defence budget that exceeds $40,000m., its military is among the most advanced in the",
  "world. In particular, Japan\u2019s Maritime Self-Defence Force is easily the most capable indigenous",
  "navy in the Asia-Paci\ufb01c, and \u2018will likely continue to \u201coutclass\u201d those of regional rivals for the",
  "foreseeable future, in spite of recent modernization e\ufb00orts within the Chinese navy and air",
  "forces\u2019.13",
  "A host of factors are driving enhanced co-operation between India and Japan. They share a",
  "similar desire to see a multi-polar Asia that is stable and secure. Both nations are also heavily",

  "quite explicit about the fact that India\u2019s presence in East Asia provides a needed balance to",
  "China\u2019s in\ufb02uence.14 In an e\ufb00ort to forestall competition from its southern and eastern neigh-",

  "visit to Japan in December 2006, the two countries established a framework to transform their",
  "relationship into a strategicpartnership thatwouldimpact all aspects ofinterstate tiesfrom trade",

  "region and on long-term strategic and global issues. This marks only the second such security",
  "agreement that Japan has entered into and it is only India\u2019s third after the USA and Australia.",
  "To further co-operation, the Indian Chiefs of Naval Sta\ufb00 and Army Sta\ufb00 visited Japan for",
  "conferences with their counterparts in 2008 and 2009, respectively.",
  "The most visible example of Indo-Japanese security ties occurred in mid-April 2007 when",
  "the \ufb01rst ever multilateral exercise featuring India, Japan and the USA took place o\ufb00 of Tokyo",
  "Bay, featuring four Japanese guided missile destroyers, two American destroyers, and an Indian",
  "destroyer, corvette and tanker. A reciprocal exercise, Malabar 07-2, also involving Australia and",

  "Commenting on the signi\ufb01cance of enhanced Indo-Japanese ties, then-Prime Minster Abe",
  "suggested that this would become Japan\u2019s \u2018most important bilateral relationship in the world\u2019.20",
  "This is a bold pronouncement given the importance of Japan\u2019s security alliance with the USA;",
  "however, India appears to be putting similar weight on the bilateral relationship. As former",
  "Indian external a\ufb00airs minister Lalit Mansingh has noted, \u2018if we are forced to choose between",
  "China and Japan, my bet will be on Japan\u2019.21 A number of Japanese and Indian scholars have",
  "assessed that the intensifying strategic partnership between Delhi and Tokyo is part of a con-",

  "In the economic realm, Indo-Japanese ties have expanded considerably over the past decade.",
  "India looks to Japan as a signi\ufb01cant partner for co-operation in the \ufb01elds of science and tech-",
  "nology. Since 2000, Japan has been the seventh largest source of FDI in India. In 2009, for the",
  "\ufb01rst time, Japan\u2019s investment in India ($5,220m.) exceeded its investment in China ($3,650m.),",
  "which signals an expansion of future economic interaction between the two countries. In the",
  "logic of comparative advantage, India\u2019s abundance of labour and steadily increasing human",
  "capital pairs nicely with Japan\u2019s capital intensive but labour-scarce economy. Having been the",
  "\ufb01rst recipient of Japanese aid in 1958, India is also the leading recipient of Japanese overseas",
  "development aid. For example, Tokyo has supported major infrastructure projects within India,",
  "mostnotably the DelhitoMumbai industrial corridor, whichseeksto create a1,483-km global",
  "manufacturing and transport corridor that spans six states. Since 2007, India and Japan have",
  "been undertaking negotiations on an FTA, known as the CEPA, which Prime Minister Singh",
  "hopestohavecompletedforsigningbythetimeofthenextannualsummitattheendof2010.",
  "Given this trajectory of Indo-Japanese ties, there was deep apprehension in Delhi over the",
  "political earthquake that took place in Tokyo in late August 2009 when the ruling Liberal",
  "DemocraticParty(LDP)wasvotedoutofo\ufb03ceforthe\ufb01rsttimesincetheSecondWorldWar.",
  "The Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) leader and new Prime Minister, Yukio Hatoyama, had",
  "made no secret of his priority of building relations with China and fostering pan-Asian co-",
  "operation, which left a large question mark hanging over the future of Indo-Japanese ties\u2014",
  "particularlysince, incontrastto previousyears,theDPJ\u2019selectionmanifestoin2009madescant",
  "reference to India. Consequently, it was an important sign that Hatoyama was eager to visit",
  "Delhi in December 2009 for the annual prime ministerial summit\u2014the only annual prime",
  "ministerial-level dialogue Japan has with any country. The 2009 meeting resulted in the",
  "announcement of a New Stage of Japan-India Strategic and Global Partnership, which seeks to",
  "deepen bilateral co-operation on economic, regional and global issues as well as an action plan",
  "to concretely advance the security co-operation agreed to in 2008 in areas such as maritime",
  "security disaster management and disarmament.23 That did much to signify that Hatoyama\u2019s",
  "\u2018Asia-centric\u2019 vision included India and that Indo-Japanese ties command bipartisan support in",
  "Tokyo. With Hatoyama\u2019s sudden resignation and replacement by \ufb01nance minister Naoto Kan,",
  "uncertainty has again returned. The relationship is likely to undergo a shift of emphasis, with",
  "concerns about China, geopolitical rivalry and shared democratic values being downplayed in",
  "favour of economic linkages and deepening co-operation in existing areas.",
  "Despite the great public enthusiasm, there are reasons to be somewhat more circumspect",
  "when examining Indo-Japanese ties. Economic engagement between the two countries has",
  "failed to keep pace with the development of security ties. Trade between the two nations has",
  "been increasing, from $6,540m. in 2005/06, to $7,470m. in 2006/07, $10,190m. in 2007/08,",

  "From an Indian perspective, there is also a signi\ufb01cant imbalance to the trade, with India pri-",

  "Having been an early supporter of the People\u2019s Republic of China in its bid to join the UN,",
  "India\u2019s scrupulous adherence to a \u2018one-China\u2019 policy limited diplomatic interaction with",
  "Taiwan until the mid-1990s. However, the economic imperatives of forging ties with a top 25",
  "world economy as part of Look East led to the establishment of bilateral ties in 1995 through",

  "attempting to diversify its international economic linkages away from mainland China, which",

  "and beyond. As with Japan, interest in closer ties with India is also driven by the upswing in",
  "India\u2019s relations with the USA, a recognition that the South Asian giant can help ensure that",
  "Asia is not dominated by a single nation, and the belief that the democratic character of both",
  "governments provides a solid foundation for a future relationship.",
  "Despite active e\ufb00orts to promote economic, cultural and scienti\ufb01c exchanges, Indian leaders",
  "have attempted to avoid any o\ufb03cial high-level contact between serving government o\ufb03cials of",
  "the two nations. On the other hand, uno\ufb03cial contacts have been steadily growing. For",
  "example, parliamentarian and former defence minister George Fernandes visited Taiwan in",
  "2004, while during a reciprocal visit the same year, former senior o\ufb03cials in the Taiwanese",
  "Ministry of Foreign A\ufb00airs met with former Prime Minister Gujral and former Deputy Prime",
  "Minister Advani. The following year, a group of Taiwanese legislators met with Indian parlia-",
  "mentary counterparts from the Lok Sabha in New Delhi. In 2007 then-Kuomintang (KMT)",
  "leader and subsequent Taiwanese President Ma Ying-jeou visited New Delhi, where he met",
  "with serving Indian government ministers and opposition leaders in an e\ufb00ort to expand scien-",
  "ti\ufb01c and economic co-operation with India. Ma was the \ufb01rst leader of the KMT party to visit",
  "India since 1942.",
  "While the Taiwanese Government has been promoting India as an attractive alternative to",
  "the mainland for investment, its e\ufb00orts to expand economic linkages have so far had only",
  "modest results. India\u2019s trade with Taiwan has been increasing in recent years, from $2,010m.",
