  "Introduction",
  "India\u2019s engagementwiththe South-EastAsianregioninthepost-Cold Warperiodhasassumed",
  "signi\ufb01cant proportions and remains one of the top priorities of the country\u2019s foreign policy.1",
  "India has consequently become one of the central pillars and players in South-East Asia at the",
  "dawn of the 21st century.",
  "Initiated in the early part of the 1990s, India\u2019s \u2018Look East\u2019 policy has been directed to",
  "the region through the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). Though it is",
  "claimed that the Look East policy encompasses the entire Asia-Paci\ufb01c region, its primary",
  "focus was undoubtedly on South-East Asia during the \ufb01rst phase of this policy that lasted",
  "until recently. It appears that during the second phase, India, apart from consolidating its",
  "relations with South-East Asia, is looking beyond at the larger Asia-Paci\ufb01c region. India has",
  "been a full dialogue partner of ASEAN since 1995 and a summit-level partner since 2002.2",
  "India has also been a member of the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) since 1996, a founding",
  "member of the East Asian Summit (EAS) since 2005 and a member of the Asia Europe",
  "Meeting (ASEM) since 2006. While working its way through incremental stages to reach the",
  "status of ASEAN summit-level partner, Indian diplomacy also adopted the parallel strategy of",
  "enrolling in the ASEAN system through bilateral, regional and sub-regional means. Mem-",
  "bership in these multiple groupings enabled India to cultivate varied linkages with ASEAN",
  "member states.",
  "This article will focus primarily upon India\u2019s emerging political, economic and strategic links",
  "with the South-East Asian region as part of its Look East policy. The \ufb01rst part of this chapter",
  "will analyse the genesis of India\u2019s Look East policy in the early part of the 1990s. The second",
  "part of the chapter will critically look into the emerging economic co-operation between India",
  "and ASEAN. The third part of the chapter will analyse the emerging security co-operation",
  "between India and ASEAN, including India\u2019s role in the ARF. The fourth part of the chapter",
  "will dwell on the evolving ties between India and two sub-regional organizations: the Bay",
  "of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC),",
  "formed in 1997, and the Mekong Ganga Cooperation (MGC) forum, formed in 2000.",

  "Genesis of the \u2018Look East\u2019 policy",
  "Despite India\u2019s geographical proximity to South-East Asia, sharing over 1,600 km of land",
  "boundary with Myanmar and maritime boundaries with Myanmar, Thailand and Indonesia,",
  "South-East Asia was hardly a priority area in Indian foreign policy before the 1990s.",
  "India was not among the countries that enthusiastically welcomed the formation of ASEAN",
  "in August 1967; India\u2019s ambivalent attitude towards ASEAN stemmed from the new Asian",
  "body\u2019s pronounced pro-Western orientation.3 This led India to wonder about the organiza-",
  "tion\u2019s true purpose, especially in the context of the British Government\u2019s decision at that time",
  "to withdrawmilitarily from eastofthe Suezand theuncertain USrole in Indo-China.ASEAN",
  "members were, anyway, initially lukewarm to any idea of India\u2019s membership in the regional",
  "association for individual reasons. Indonesia, the natural and de facto leader of the organization,",
  "feared that if India became a member it would dominate the organization. Coupled with this,",
  "India\u2019s strong anti-Chinese feelings, particularly after the Sino\u2013Indian border con\ufb02ict of 1962,",
  "might have created an adverse impact on Singapore\u2019s majority ethnic Chinese population if",
  "India at that time had been admitted as a member of ASEAN. Furthermore, Thailand and the",
  "Philippines were opposed to India\u2019s non-aligned foreign policy and were overtly pro-USA.",
  "Moreover,afterthesigningoftheIndo-SovietTreatyofPeace,FriendshipandCo-operation",
  "by India in 1971, the ASEAN states were suspicious of the USSR\u2019s role in determining India\u2019s",
  "foreign policy towards the region in general, and Viet Nam in particular. After Viet Nam\u2019s",
  "military intervention in Kampuchea in December 1978, India, by its decision to recognize the",
  "Heng Samrin regime in Kampuchea backed by Viet Nam forfeited whatever little goodwill it",
  "enjoyed in the ASEAN region at that time.4 Such Cold War postures created a distance",
  "betweenIndiaandtheASEANforalongtimeuntiltheworldbipolarstructurecollapsedinthe",
  "late 1980s, ushering in a new era of regional equations.",
  "The cumulative impact of the political and strategic changes that followed the end of the",
  "ColdWarandtheadoptionofmarketreformsbytheCongress(I)GovernmentinIndiaheaded",
  "byP.V.NarasimhaRao(1991\u201396)ledtoagradualtransitioninIndian-ASEANrelations.Itwas",
  "duringthistimethattheCongressGovernmentinIndiainitiatedtheLookEastpolicy,withthe",
  "aim ofre-ordering India\u2019s relationswiththe states in theSouth-East Asianregion.The ASEAN",
  "states openly supported the economic reforms initiated by Rao to liberalize the Indian econ-",
  "omy, expecting greater compatibility and economic synergies between the two sides. Many",
  "ASEAN states were attracted by the economic opportunities that a huge market like India",
  "o\ufb00ered after the decision to liberalize the Indian economy was taken. India was, in turn,",
  "attracted by the economic vitality of South-East Asia: \u2018India had to go beyond the con\ufb01nes of",
  "SAARC if it had to reap the bene\ufb01ts out of the economic potential of the South East Asian",
  "region and establish itself as a regional power\u2019.5",
  "While the economic reforms initiated in India were still in their infancy, it is of signi\ufb01cance",
  "that ASEAN accorded sectoral dialogue partner status to India in January 1992 in the areas of",
  "trade, investment and tourism. India obtained the status of full dialogue partner of ASEAN in",
  "1995, which underscored ASEAN\u2019s readiness to engage India in the various sectors of the dia-",
  "logue partnership, as opposed to its former reticence to deal with India in certain limited areas.",
  "India also became a summit-level partner of ASEAN from 2002 onwards. Moreover, alongside",
  "closer economic co-operation with India, ASEAN was eager to engage India in discussions on",
  "politico-security issues as well. Following the award of full dialogue partner status, India was",
  "admitted to the ARF in 1996.",
  "Backed by defence co-operation agreements with a number of countries, regular top-level",
  "political exchanges and thriving economic interaction, India is emerging as an important player",

  "in the South-East Asian and the wider Asia-Paci\ufb01c region. For India, the Look East policy is",
  "aimed at greater economic alignment with, and a political role in, the dynamic Asia-Paci\ufb01c",
  "region in general, and the South-East Asian region in particular. India clearly saw South-East",
  "Asia as a region where political, strategic and economic conditions could enable it to play a",
  "signi\ufb01cant role.",
  "India-ASEAN economic co-operation",
  "Economics is at the heart of India\u2019s foreign policy (the Manmohan Doctrine) and is one of the",
  "instruments of its thrust towards ASEAN. As India\u2019s Prime Minister Manmohan Singh put it at",
  "the 2009 India-ASEAN Summit, \u2018the ASEAN region is synonymous with dynamic economic",
  "growth [\u2026] India\u2019s engagement with the ASEAN is at the heart of our Look East Policy. We",
  "are convinced that India\u2019s future and our economic interests are best served by greater integra-",
  "tion with our Asian partners in ASEAN.6",
  "Since the initiation of the Look East policy, India has made signi\ufb01cant progress in cultivating",
  "a multifaceted relationship with ASEAN on one hand, and its member states on the other. In",
  "the economic realm, the Look East policy provided a tremendous encouragement to economic",
  "ties between India and the ASEAN member states, resulting in the constitution of a number of",
  "institutional mechanisms to promote economic exchanges. The earlier Joint Trade Committees",
  "with the ASEAN states were upgraded as Joint Business Commissions and an India-ASEAN",
  "Business Council and ASEAN-India Joint Management Committee were formed.",
  "After India became a full dialogue partner of ASEAN in 1995, the ASEAN-India Joint Co-",
  "operation Committee and ASEAN-India Working Group on Trade and Investment were set",
  "up.AnASEAN-IndiaFundwascreatedtopromotetrade,tourism,scienceandtechnology,and",

  "during April 2000\u2013April 2009 was around US $7,900m., rising to $3,450m. in 2008/09 alone.",
  "The progress between India and the ASEAN with regard to bilateral trade is equally",
  "impressive. India\u2019s trade grew fastest with South-East Asia compared with any other region",
  "between1991and1997.WhileASEANexportskeptthemomentum,therewasaconsiderable",

  "ASEAN, which temporarily slowed in the wake of the Asian \ufb01nancial crisis, again started to",
  "pick up from 2000 onwards. It is important to note that the two-way trade between India and",
  "the ASEAN countries witnessedan approximate seven-fold increase from the level of $5,900m.",

  "The ARF constitutes a vital institutional link through which India has tried to consolidate its",

  "Bangkok ASEAN summit in July 1994. The ARF provided India with an opportunity to",
  "explainsomeofitspoliciesandbreaktheisolationthatresultedfromitsalliancewiththeformer",
  "USSR during the Cold War. Many ASEAN countries viewed India, which joined the ARF in",
  "1996, as a possible counterweight to future Chinese expansionism in the South-East Asian",
  "region.9 Many government leaders and diplomats in South-East Asia are of the opinion that as",
  "an emerging power, India has a great role to play in the region. This factor was also one of the",
  "important reasons that made India attain the summit-level partner status with ASEAN in 2002.",
  "The \ufb01rst India-ASEAN summit took place in 2002, with India acceding to the ASEAN Treaty",
  "of Amity and Cooperation in Southeast Asia (TAC) in 2003.",
  "This strategic importance of India for the ASEAN states was very much evident after the",

  "ofcondemning Indiaand Pakistan worked in India\u2019s favour. Inthe period immediately prior to",
  "the Manila ARF meeting in July 1998, India had been successful in clarifying its stand on the",
  "nuclear tests to the ARF member states. The joint communiqu\u00e9 issued at the end of the ARF",
  "meetingwasmoderateanditmerelydeploredtheseriesofnucleartestsinSouthAsia.The\ufb01nal",
  "ASEAN position was largely shaped by Indonesia, which attacked the double standards and",
  "hypocrisy of the Western states, while countries like Singapore and Malaysia played a central",
  "role in ensuring that India was not isolated at the ARF. China\u2019s demand that the ARF express",
  "strong support for the UN Security Council Resolution condemning the nuclear tests in South",
  "Asia was rejected. Even Thailand and the Philippines fell in line with the common ASEAN",
  "position on the nuclear tests. While the ASEAN states were not prepared to do anything that",
  "would resemble a stand against China, they were also reluctant to let India down and displayed",
  "genuine concern for its security.",
  "There is no denying the fact that the China factor, too, started to weigh heavily in several",
  "ASEANquartersparticularlyaftertheclosureoftheUSbasesinthePhilippinesin1992andthe",
  "emergence of the territorial disputes in the South China Sea as a major cause of concern, with",
  "China strongly maintaining its claims over the disputed area. While China has achieved greater",
  "economic integration with the region, there still remains apprehension over the strategic role it",
  "will play in the future. Although India has explicitly refuted the idea of becoming a counter-",
  "balancing power vis-\u00e0-vis China, it did not seem to be averse to the idea of using South-East",
  "Asian worries to advance its political and strategic interests in the region.10 India, along with",
  "ASEAN, is particularly concerned about the growing Chinese in\ufb02uence in strategically located",
  "Myanmar. Contrary to previous perceptions, many South-East Asian states have begun to look",
  "upon India as a power that could play a kindof balancing role in the region,as Lee Kuan Yew",
  "delicately put it, to \u2018keep the center in ASEAN, India would be a useful balance to China\u2019s",
  "heft\u2019.11 Many scholars are of the view that India\u2019s entry into the ARF in 1996 was primarily a",
  "result of common interests that existed between the ASEAN states and India regarding per-",
  "ceptions of the threat posed by China. The upshot of the convergence of political and strategic",
  "interests between India and the South-East Asian states was the basis of a new strategic inter-",
  "action between India and several South-East Asian states at the bilateral level.",
  "India has also entered into bilateral defence pacts with most of the South-East Asian states",
  "facilitating the sale of technology, training personnel and joint military exercises. The degree of",
  "India\u2019s military co-operation is greater with the ASEAN states than with its immediate neigh-",
  "bours in South Asia. Their mutual security concern is guided by two broad factors: reconciling",
  "US military supremacy in the Asia-Paci\ufb01c and balancing China\u2019s ascendancy in the region.",
  "Shedding the earlier Cold War suspicions of India\u2019s naval expansionism, the ASEAN countries",
  "are near unanimous in welcoming an Indian strategic role in the region, barring certain diplo-",
  "matic qualms entertained by individual countries. Security co-operation between India and the",
  "ASEAN states is governed by military diplomacy, the naval forces being the prime instrument",
  "of building synergies. The regular deployment of the Indian Navy into the South China Sea",
  "since 2000 has been a not unwelcome feature for the South-East Asian states, though causing",

  "Beginning with bilateral military initiatives and then through membership of the ARF and",

  "and Indonesia about Indian expansionist designs in South-East Asia in the 1980s. In 1992 the",
  "Malaysia-India Defence Committee was set up. Defence dialogue between India and Singapore",
  "began in the early 1990s, and by 1993 the navies of both states were engaged in joint naval",
  "exercises. A Memorandum of Understanding was signed between India and Viet Nam on",
  "bilateral defence co-operation in 1994, when the then Indian Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha",
  "Rao visited Hanoi. Bilaterally, while the economic partnership is growing steadily, defence co-",
  "operation has accelerated to the point of signing a strategic partnership between the two states",
  "during the visit of Vietnamese Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung to India in July 2007. By",
  "1995 the Indian-sponsored multilateral naval exercise, MILAN, had engaged the key Malacca",

  "South-East Asia.",
  "Particular noticeable defence interactions have developed between India and Singapore,",
  "beginning with joint naval exercises in 1993. These were followed up in successive years,",
  "including Singapore\u2019s participation in Madad-98, a multilateral search and rescue exercise",
  "launched by the Indian Navy. Singapore was the \ufb01rst among the South-East Asian states to",

  "his visit to New Delhi in 2007. A bilateral Defence Co-operation Agreement was signed",
  "between India and Indonesia, following which the \ufb01rst ever joint defence co-operation com-",
  "mittee meeting took place at New Delhi in June 2007. Among other factors, Indonesia\u2019s latest",
  "security initiatives are guided by concern over China\u2019s ascendancy in the South-East Asian",
  "region and China\u2019s expanding military co-operation with the military regime in Myanmar.",
  "Moreover, India\u2019s role in combating non-conventional security threats to the ASEAN states",
  "is well recognized, although this mutually bene\ufb01cial relationship is more evident at the bilat-",
  "eral level than at the multilateral level. In fact, India\u2019s Minister of External A\ufb00airs o\ufb00ered a",
  "package at the 14th ARF meeting in 2007 to design and conduct training modules on mar-",
  "itime security, geared at anti-piracy, search and rescue, o\ufb00shore and port security, anti-smug-",
  "gling and drugs control and anti-poaching operations. In its attempt to further consolidate",
  "security ties with the ASEAN after the terrorist attacks on the USA on 11 September 2001,",
  "India signed a Joint Declaration with ASEAN in October 2003 at the Bali Summit for",
  "Cooperation to Combat International Terrorism.12 The Declaration clearly rejects any attempt",
  "to associate terrorism with any religion, race or nationality, and regards acts of terrorism in all",
  "its forms and manifestations committed wherever, whenever and by whomsoever. Further,",
  "India and the Philippines signed an Extradition Treaty in March 2004. India also signed a",
  "Treaty on Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters with Thailand in 2004 and with Sin-",
  "gapore in June 2005. In 2005 a Memorandum of Understanding was signed between India",
  "and Thailand on joint maritime patrols to prevent piracy and smuggling in the Andaman Sea.",
  "An Extradition Treaty between India and Thailand was also signed. Further, an agreement was",
  "reached on mutual co-operation to handle prominent leaders of Indian insurgent out\ufb01ts hiding",
  "in Thailand. Similarly, India and Myanmar, during the visit of the Indian defence minister to",
  "Myanmar in 2007, agreed to launch joint army operations to \ufb02ush out north-eastern Indian",
  "insurgent camps located inside Myanmar\u2019s territory. Earlier, both India and the Myanmar",
  "Government had co-operated to conduct two counter-insurgency o\ufb00ensives, Operation Leech",
  "and Operation Golden Duck, to \ufb01ght militant groups and their networks along the India\u2013",
  "Myanmar border.",
  "India\u2019s bilateral and multilateral engagement with the ASEAN states essentially is a function",
  "of her wider strategic objectives in South-East Asia and the Asia-Paci\ufb01c region. ASEAN",
  "remains integral to India\u2019s overall strategic arrangement in the South-East Asian and the wider",
  "Asia-Paci\ufb01c region. Undoubtedly, China is at the core of Indian assessment of the regional",
  "strategic environment and Indian diplomacy has played on the fears entertained by most of the",
  "states in the region of an economically and militarily rising Chinese power. Through a prudent",
  "and subtle assimilation of political, economic and military tactics, which avoids a direct anti-",
  "China alliance, axis or coalition, India is consolidating her position in the South-East Asian and",
  "Asia-Paci\ufb01c region as a countervailing or \u2018balancing\u2019 power to China.13 Almost all the states in",
  "the region are worried about the rise of China, although they refrain from admitting this",
  "openly.",
  "Such a perception also brings India and the USA together to check China\u2019s rapid rise in",
  "South-East Asia. Both the USA and India also agree on a number of other strategic objectives",
  "that include combating terrorism and piracy, protection of the Sea Lines of Communication",
  "(SLOCs), anti-drugs drives, safety of energy andmercantile transportation, etc. Thegeopolitical",
  "range of mutual convergence spans from the Persian Gulf, Indian Ocean, Malacca Straits and",
  "beyond, up to the South China Sea.",

  "the USA, Japan and Australia, may cast a shadow over India-ASEAN relations in the future.",
  "The Australia-India-USA-Japan quadrilateral grouping formed in 2007 could constitute an",
  "outer ring around the ASEAN security framework, although such a forum has yet to design its",
  "form and content. One of the important drivers for this quadrilateral grouping was to hedge",
  "against China and to counter its so-called \u2018string of pearls strategy\u2019, and undertake decisive",
  "measures to meet threats to the security of the Asia-Paci\ufb01c region. Close military co-operation",
  "is already taking place between the members of this group and they have conducted joint",
  "military exercises in the Indian and Paci\ufb01c Ocean waters, though Australia showed some hesi-",
  "tation over continuing such a format. Whether such non-ASEAN groups will in future com-",
  "plement the ASEAN or override its regional identity will also in\ufb02uence India\u2019s relations with",
  "ASEAN. The ASEAN members, perhaps with the exception of Singapore, will not unan-",
  "imously and openly endorse the quadrilateral group, since they do not want to invite Chinese",
  "ire. Further, there is the possibility of such an evolving four-power framework undermining",
  "ASEAN\u2019s own central role in regional multilateral security frameworks. ASEAN has always",
  "insisted on remaining in the driver\u2019s seat in both the ARF and the EAS. As part of her Look",
  "East policy, it remains to be seen how far India will perform a balancing act of deepening and",
  "consolidating its links with the ASEAN states and simultaneously building up strong linkages",
  "with the Paci\ufb01c Rim powers further east like Australia, Japan and the USA.",

  "Conclusions",
  "The Look East policy has been the cornerstone of the country\u2019s new foreign policy initiative",
  "since the end ofthe Cold War. It ismultidimensional in itsobjectives and re\ufb02ects a new-found",
  "desire on the part of India to play a pre-eminent role in the a\ufb00airs of South-East Asia and the",
  "Asia-Paci\ufb01c region, which constitutes a part of India\u2019s extended neighbourhood. Despite enormous",
  "progress being made since the early 1990s, India still lags far behind China and the USA in",
  "terms of geopolitical and economic importance in the South-East Asian region.",
  "Intermsoftradeandinvestment,thereisagrowingrealization intheSouth-EastAsianstates",
  "that despite China\u2019s greater attractiveness, India is an expanding economy and is one of the",
  "largest emerging markets for products and services in the world. Therefore, it would be too",
  "risky to excessively depend on China. There is no doubt that ASEAN has served one of India\u2019s",
  "major objectives of the Look East policy, which is reaching out to the wider Asia-Paci\ufb01c",
  "region.AsfarasthesecuritylandscapeofSouth-EastAsiaandtheAsia-Paci\ufb01cisconcerned,itis",
  "quite evident that the USA will continue to act as the pre-eminent power and will try to",
  "maintain the strategic balance in the region. Most signi\ufb01cantly, improved relations between",
  "India and the USA have also helped to facilitate India\u2019s relations with the ASEAN member",
  "states, given that most ASEAN states (with the exception of Myanmar and, to a lesser extent,",
  "Laos, Viet Nam and Cambodia) have close and cordial ties with the USA.",
  "Moreover, in building relations with the ASEAN states, India enjoys certain political advan-",
  "tages. Unlike China or Japan, there is no historical baggage to worry about invasion or inter-",
  "ference by India. In contrast to China, India also does not have any security problem with any",
  "of the South-East Asian states. In fact, some of the South-East Asian states consider India to be",
  "uniquely placed to play a kind of balancing role so that the region does not come under the",
  "in\ufb02uence of any one Great Power. Therefore, it is not without signi\ufb01cance that following the",
  "\ufb01rst India-ASEAN summit in 2002, India was described as the \u2018western wing\u2019 of the ASEAN",
