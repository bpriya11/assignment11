  "Introduction",
  "This chapter traces the role that nuclear weapons have played within India\u2019s international rela-",
  "tions from her independence in 1947 to her emergence as a future Great Power at the begin-",
  "ning of the 21st century. During this period, nuclear weapons and nuclear technology became",
  "critical touchstones for India\u2019s leaders and policy-makers, serving as powerful emblems of the",
  "country\u2019s independence, its technological pro\ufb01ciency and gradual modernization. In terms of",
  "international relations, nuclear power is regarded as a tool with which India can achieve stra-",
  "tegicautonomy,andprovideself-su\ufb03ciencyinherdiplomatic,politicalandeconomica\ufb00airs.As",
  "India\u2019s \ufb01rst Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru pondered \u2018what does independence consist of? \u2013",
  "it consists fundamentally and basically of foreign relations\u2019.2 Nuclear power helps enable this",
  "vision of independence and encompassed Nehruvian principles of non-violence, non-align-",
  "ment, peace, disarmament, self-reliance and development. In turn, nuclear weapons were a",
  "means with which to protect Indian territory from external forces, to secure her regional pre-",
  "eminence and to stake her claim to future in\ufb02uence in the international system.",
  "While re\ufb02ective of the aspirations and beliefs of her leaders, India\u2019s domestic and foreign",
  "policy concerning nuclear weapons came to be based upon a paradox centred on the con-",
  "current \u2018pursuit of independence and a commitment to peace\u2019.3 Thus, on one hand the acqui-",
  "sition of nuclear technology could help alleviate the country\u2019s energy needs, sustain its",
  "economic development and provide (through nuclear weapons) an e\ufb00ective deterrent against",
  "the negative intentions of its neighbours and others. On the other hand, however, India\u2019s lea-",
  "ders remained resolutely pro-nuclear disarmament, arguing that the existence of any nuclear",
  "weapons threatened India\u2019s security and that of the world. These latter views re\ufb02ected both the",

  "The chapter is split into three major sections. In the \ufb01rst section, I investigate the roots of",
  "India\u2019s nuclear programme post-independence until the late 1960s, and show how India\u2019s lea-",

  "the nuclear tests of 1998 and their aftermath, in particular India\u2019s increased international lever-",
  "age but also the continuing paradox of maintaining her opposition to nuclear weapons while",
  "developing them. The chapter ends with some thoughts as to the continued role and impor-",
  "tance ofnuclearweapons (andnucleartechnology) in de\ufb01ningthe current andfuturetrajectory",
  "of India\u2019s international relations.",
  "Nuclear beginnings and the early Cold War",
  "India\u2019s aspirations for a nuclear programme began before independence and were then con-",
  "secrated through the creation of the Indian Atomic Energy Commission in 1948. Combining",
  "work at the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (itself set up in 1945), Homi Bhabha was",
  "the founding chair of the Atomic Energy Commission and guided India\u2019s nascent nuclear",
  "development. In turn, and complementing his role as India\u2019s \ufb01rst Prime Minister and defence",
  "minister,JawaharlalNehruheldresponsibilityfortheDepartmentofAtomicEnergy(DAE)that",
  "had been created in August 1954. This had few, if any, institutional checks or balances and was",
  "open to little military in\ufb02uence, re\ufb02ecting its technological rather than militaristic orientation.4",
  "The DAE would remain under the direct control of subsequent Indian prime ministers. Eco-",
  "nomic advancement initially drove India\u2019s nuclear considerations, which were simultaneously",
  "aimedatovercomingdecadesofcolonialexploitation,developingIndia\u2019stechnicalinfrastructure",
  "and garnering international prestige through a display of scienti\ufb01c prowess. As funding sig-",
  "ni\ufb01cantly rose in the earlier 1950s, India\u2019s leaders increasingly saw nuclear science as a way to",
  "ameliorate India\u2019s post-independence position and to signal her international resurgence.5",
  "WhileIndia\u2019snuclearprogrammehelpedtonurtureIndia\u2019sindustrialbasethroughtheskillof",
  "her physicists and mathematicians, it was also multi-faceted through its focus on the multiple",
  "uses of nuclear energy. Initially, the peaceful non-military uses of nuclear energy were promi-",
  "nentandmixedwiththewidergoalofuniversalnucleardisarmament.Thisapproachcon\ufb01rmed",
  "a focus on India\u2019s economic development that eschewed military spending and an avoidance of",
  "the two superpower blocs, as manifested through India\u2019s leadership of the Non-Aligned",
  "Movement (NAM). Principles of ahimsa (non-violence) and satyagraha (truth-force\u2014the doc-",
  "trine used to describe non-violence) further supported the aim of achieving peaceful develop-",
  "ment. In turn, a world free of nuclear weapons would help to reduce the risk of existential",
  "nuclear con\ufb02ict, protect South Asia from external in\ufb02uences, and enhance Indian security.",
  "Maintaining India\u2019s independence underpinned these notions through a \u2018refusal to accept any",
  "external controls and restraints instituted in a discriminatory way\u2019,6 and a commitment to",
  "peaceful, non-military uses of nuclear technology.",
  "India\u2019s nuclear development came to be described in terms of self-reliance and self-su\ufb03-",
  "ciency, manifestations that called for the country\u2019s autonomy to be protected in all spheres.",

  "beused for defence anddeterrent also became noted withinIndia\u2019s early international relations.",
  "Indeed, as India-China relations began to deteriorate in the late 1950s a consensus developed",
  "among India\u2019s leaders that nuclear weapons could and should be developed if a commensurate",
  "nuclear threat from China was apparent.7 Such threat perceptions would inculcate more mili-",
  "tary uses of India\u2019s nuclear potential and bolster her nascent independence. They also re\ufb02ected",
  "the viewthat,from theverybeginning, manyofIndia\u2019sscientistsandleaders knewthatnuclear",
  "technology \u2018would bring nuclear weapons\u2019.8 This outlook then coupled with tensions between",
  "amoralantagonism towardsnuclearweapons (includingdemandsfordisarmament) andadesire",
  "to be a Great Power. A nuclear capability often came to personify the latter, particularly in",
  "terms of avoiding any international isolation and also by creating a bargaining chip that chal-",
  "lenged the hold on atomic technology by the veto-wielding P-5 (the USA, USSR, United",
  "Kingdom, France and China) Permanent Members of the UN Security Council (UNSC).",
  "In the early Cold War period, however, India\u2019s focus remained more on technological",
  "advancement in terms of nuclear energy and associated economic bene\ufb01ts rather than with",
  "developinganucleararsenal.Thus,from1955onwardsnuclearco-operationbetweenIndiaand",
  "several other governments (Canada, the USA, the United Kingdom and France) was estab-",
  "lished. These links led to the building of the APSARA research (light water) reactor in 1956,",
  "the \ufb01rst research reactor of its kind in Asia, and to the building of the CIRUS research (heavy",
  "water) reactor in 1960. By 1962 Indian scientists had begun producing their own heavy water",
  "andin1965theyseparatedplutoniumforthe\ufb01rsttime.9Alltheseaccomplishmentsrepresented",
  "key steps in the realization of India\u2019s nuclear energy industry, but also had possible dual usages,",
  "especially the manufacture of weapons grade plutonium. In turn, in April 1954 in the Indian",
  "parliament Nehru had called for the prohibition and elimination of nuclear weapons, as well as",
  "ahalttoallnucleartesting.Thesecallscameinanerawhennucleartestswerebeingheldabove",
  "groundandeventuallycontributedtothePartialTestBanTreatyof1963wherebyatmospheric",
  "testing was banned (although France carried out such tests until 1974 and China until 1980).",
  "The ban led to the ascendancy of underground testing.",
  "By the beginning of the 1960s, several states\u2014other than the USA, which had used nuclear",
  "weaponry in 1945 against Japan at Hiroshima and Nagasaki\u2014had proven nuclear capabilities.",
  "These states were the USSR (which \ufb01rst tested in 1949), the United Kingdom (which \ufb01rst",
  "tested in 1952), and France (which \ufb01rst tested in 1960). Thus, four of the \ufb01ve powers with",
  "permanent vetoes on the UNSC, the P-5 powers, had nuclear weapons in their arsenals. After",

  "The nuclear option meant undertaking research towards the development and production of",
  "nuclear weapons and associated technology (such as missiles, bombs and triggering devices) for",
  "possible future use. Such an option would only be realized if and when India\u2019s security was",
  "under direct threat from another nuclear weapons-ready state, and was regarded as a pragmatic",
  "policy.10 An underlying aspiration to become a Great Power state additionally heightened the",
  "sense among India\u2019s elite that having nuclear weapons equated to being a Great Power like the",

  "front during the 1965 India\u2013Pakistan war reinforced this necessity, as did the emergence of",
  "close China-Pakistan ties aimed at limiting India\u2019s regional in\ufb02uence.12 Post-1964 the nuclear",
  "debate in India thus became dominated by the threat posed by China, the cost of nuclear",
  "weaponization and the morality of having such weapons.13",
  "At the same time, India\u2019s leaders continued to call for a complete ban on nuclear testing and",
  "began campaigning in 1965 for a universal non-proliferation treaty. Such a treaty would be",
  "based upon those states with nuclear arsenals giving them up in order to inspire \u2018would-be",
  "nuclear\u2019 states not to attempt development. Within the international community at large and",
  "the P-5 powers, China\u2019s 1964 tests had also underlined the need to prevent further prolifera-",
  "tion. The resultant Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) was signed on 1 July 1968 by the",
  "United Kingdom, the USA and the USSR, and came into force on 5 May 1970. However,",
  "rather than ful\ufb01lling India\u2019s aims of banning all nuclear weapons, the NPT split the world into",
  "Nuclear Weapons States (NWS)\u2014de\ufb01ned as those that had tested prior to 1 January 1967 and",
  "who could keep their weapons\u2014and Non-Nuclear Weapons States (NNWS)\u2014which were",
  "banned from ever possessing or developing nuclear weapons. The terms of the NPT were then",
  "to be reviewed every \ufb01ve years from 1970 onwards. Opposed to a treaty that did not provide",
  "\u2018equal and legitimate security\u201914 for all states, and in order to keep the nuclear option open,",
  "India refused to sign the NPT. As such, India\u2019s leaders maintained the policy that, \u2018unless",
  "everyone closes the nuclear door, it is not in India\u2019s interests to do so.\u201915 The NPT also",
  "increased Indian distrust of the international community, as it threatened India\u2019s autonomy,",
  "development and long-term power aims.",

  "By the early 1970s the ambiguity of the \u2018nuclear option\u2019 had e\ufb00ectively merged India\u2019s anti-",

  "This ambiguity ensured that India\u2019s weaponization programme continued but simultaneously",

  "the creation of Bangladesh), and had signed the 20-year Treaty of Peace, Friendship and",
  "Cooperation with the USSR, India\u2019s regional security environment was deteriorating. This",

  "At the time there was a sense that the PNE \u2018impart to Indians a sense of security and self-",
  "con\ufb01dence\u2019,18 and was emblematic of India\u2019s criticism of the P-5 powers and the NPT. While",
  "France congratulated India on her successful tests, and the USSR and China were more muted",
  "yet critical in their responses, the USA and Canada removed all nuclear ties and assistance. In",
  "turn, the USA introduced sanctions on all its economic and military aid to India. The severity",
  "of this response came from India\u2019s open challenge to the P-5\u2019s anti-proliferation regime, but",
  "also that US (and Canadian) reactors had been used to help produce the \ufb01ssile material used in",
  "the PNE. As a non-signatory of the NPT, India was also not under International Atomic",
  "Energy Agency (IAEA) safeguards\u2014a factor that increased international anger. Furthermore",
  "(andenhancingIndianperceptionsofaninternationalconspiracyagainstit),thePNE ledtothe",
  "creation of the London Suppliers Group (later renamed the Nuclear Suppliers Group\u2014NSG).",
  "This group aimed to control the export and transfer of materials that could be used to produce",
  "nuclear weapons. It thus prevented India from gaining assistance with its nuclear programme",
  "(including nuclear reactors, components, international scienti\ufb01c contacts and exchanges), but",
  "also emboldened Indian self-su\ufb03ciency and nuclear autonomy by further accentuating the gap",
  "between India\u2019s aspirations and her actual place in the world.",

  "1950s and early 1960s this programme had initially mirrored India\u2019s with an Atomic Energy",
  "Commission established in 1956 and little consideration given to the military uses of atomic",
  "energy. By the mid-1960s, however, this approach changed as Pakistan\u2019s leaders argued that",
  "parity had to be achieved with India, particularly after Pakistan\u2019s defeat in the 1965 war.",
  "Pakistani policy-makers also became concerned with the state\u2019s lack of \u2018strategic depth\u2019 (com-",
  "monly de\ufb01ned as the distance between her borders and major cities/core industrial areas). This",
  "issue was ampli\ufb01ed by the loss in 1971 of the eastern part of her territory (which then formed",
  "the newly independent Bangladesh). The 1971 war thus led to strategic asymmetries between",
  "Pakistan and India, and led Pakistan\u2019s leaders to urge the weaponization of the state\u2019s nuclear",
  "capabilities from 1972 onwards. In turn, India\u2019s 1974 PNE \u2018increased, Pakistan\u2019s nuclear",

  "came to include a consideration of any possible nuclear dimension, especially after the outbreak",
  "of insurgency in Kashmir from 1989.20",
  "With the USSR\u2019s invasion of Afghanistan in 1979, the importance of the US-Pakistan rela-",
  "tionship was rea\ufb03rmed. Keen to prevent a Soviet success in Afghanistan, the USA vastly",
  "increased the amount of its aid to Pakistan, amounting to US $400m. in 1979 and $3,200m.",
  "over the six years from 1981 to 1987.21 While some of this aid could be used to develop",

  "Although India had the appropriate scienti\ufb01c-military nuclear infrastructure in place, it was",
  "often only US pressure (and intelligence) that had stopped any new tests, particularly in the",
  "mid-1990s.27 These factors coupled with the BJP\u2019s desire to test\u2014often bolstered by their",
  "nationalism and a need to establish the power of their governing coalition.",
  "Several other regional, global and systemic factors were also in evidence by 1998. Thus,",
  "analysts noted how India\u2019s strategic environment had deteriorated due to China\u2019s rapid eco-",
  "nomic rise, which made India-China relations asymmetrical and unbalanced. They also",
  "remarked upon how the USA was reluctant to become a declining power (and therefore",
  "wanted to force its strategic view on the world), how Pakistan had gained (covert) nuclear",
  "parity with India, and also how India\u2019s own economic growth would allow her to withstand",
  "new sanctions in the event of new testing.28 Others saw the need for a new Indian world view",
  "that shifted away from Cold War strategic calculations, particularly with the continued absence",
  "of a nuclear guarantee.29 Against this backdrop, amid great secrecy, and only two months after",
  "comingtopowerandafternewPakistanimissiletests(Ghauri)on6April,theBJPGovernment",
  "underPrimeMinisterAtalBehariVajpayeetested\ufb01venucleardeviceson11and13May1998.",
  "Con\ufb01rming theirowncapabilities andinresponse todomestic pressures,Pakistancarried outits",
  "own nuclear tests at Chaghai Hills in Baluchistan on 28 and 30 May.",
  "Codenamed Operation Shakti (strength), and often called Pokhran II (having used the same",
  "test site as the 1974 PNE), India\u2019s 1998 nuclear explosions were the \ufb01rst overt tests since the",
  "NPT had come into force in 1970. They also came at a time when several states had recently",
  "renouncedtheirnuclearprogrammes,includingSouthAfrica(in1993),Argentina(in1995)and",
  "Brazil (in 1998), all of which then signed the NPT. For India\u2019s elite, the tests were not only",
  "about challenging the international non-proliferation regime and declaring India\u2019s nuclear pro-",
  "wess to the world, but also about the ongoing validation of her nuclear programme and tech-",
  "nological development.30 Thus, the BJP could have simply declared India to be a nuclear",
  "weapons state in 1988, but during Pokhran II tested a thermonuclear device that required an as",
  "yet untested nuclear triggering device. These issues backed up the credibility and expertise of",
  "India\u2019s scienti\ufb01c community (thus continuing the central scienti\ufb01c drive of India\u2019s nuclear pro-",
  "grammethatdatedbacktothe1940s)andensuredthatIndiahadaprovenandcrediblenuclear",
  "deterrent. Furthermore, the Indian Government saw nothing illegal with the tests because as a",
  "non-signatory of the NPT and CTBT, Pokhran II did not \ufb02out any international conventions.",
  "In turn, her leaders noted that India\u2019s total of six nuclear tests in 1974 and 1998 paled in",
  "comparison with the more than 2,000 tests held by the P-5 powers since 1945.",
  "Despite initial sanctions from the USA and Japan after the tests, and almost universal con-",
  "demnation, Pokhran II resulted in India moving from an outlier of little signi\ufb01cance to the",
  "internationalmainstream.NotonlydidthetestsresultinanewassertionofIndianautonomyin",

  "between weaponization and disarmament that had been present since independence continued.",
  "Also characteristic of this paradox, India\u2019s National Security Advisory Board unveiled the",
  "state\u2019s Draft Nuclear Doctrine on 17 August 1999. The main elements of the doctrine were a",
  "no-\ufb01rst-use policy, non-use of nuclear weapons against non-nuclear weapons states, a mor-",
  "atorium on nuclear tests, the non-export of nuclear technology and working towards universal",
  "nuclear disarmament. Conservative in nature, the doctrine displayed a commitment to using",
  "\u2018strategic nuclear assets as instruments of retribution in case deterrence fails\u2019, rather than as tools",
  "ofaggression.32SuchanucleardoctrinewasregardedasconducivetostrategicstabilityinSouth",
  "Asia, which reassured China and the USA in particular, and created the image of India as a",
  "responsible nuclear power. Building upon the 1999 Draft, India\u2019s nuclear command structure",
  "was made public on 4 January 2003. These doctrines also accompanied the comprehensive",
  "review of national security in 1999 (the \ufb01rst since independence) that introduced a Nuclear",

  "improving with China.33 The most important impact of the 1998 tests was on the Indo-US",
  "relationship. After initial anger at their deception, the 1998 nuclear tests forced US attention",
  "ontoSouthAsia\u2014particularlygivenIndia\u2019ssigni\ufb01canceasthelargestmilitary(andnownuclear)",
  "power between the USA\u2019s two major military presences in the Persian Gulf and East Asia.",
  "Likewise, Pakistan\u2019s own tests placed the region under greater scrutiny and were a spur for",
  "serious dialogue between envoys from both sides. Lasting eight months, this was the longest",
  "sustained dialogue between high-level Indian and US o\ufb03cials since 1963. Against the backdrop",
  "of nuclear proliferation (with the USA urging India to sign the CTBT), Kashmir, economics",
  "and the US sanctions that had been in place since 1974, the talks transformed a di\ufb03cult rela-",
  "tionship between the two sides into a co-operative one. Critically, the USA accepted the new",
  "signi\ufb01cance of India in terms of its economy, nuclear capabilities, stable democracy and large",
  "middleclass.However,misgivingsoverUStieswithPakistanandChinacontinuedtounderpin",

  "These developments formed part of Indian elite attempts to strategically lift India away from",
  "South Asia towards a greater global role\u2014itself an ongoing goal associated with acquiring",
  "nuclear weapons\u2014and to improve her security environment. Enhanced Indo-US relations also",
  "provided possibilities to obtain (nuclear) technology transfers, which could signi\ufb01cantly aid",
  "India\u2019s economic development. Through the Agreed Principles of 21 March 2000, both sides",
  "resolved to have a closer and better relationship in all spheres (including nuclear), and with the",

  "de-hyphenating India and Pakistan when US policy-makers thought of South Asia, as well as",
  "heightened economic, political, cultural and military co-operation.",
  "Improved Indo-US relations led to the signing of their Next Steps in Strategic Partnership",

  "After being passed in the US Congress (via the Hyde Act, which allowed the modi\ufb01cation of",

  "Conclusions",
  "With a consistent policy of nurturing her atomic capabilities since independence, by the",
  "beginning of the 21st century India\u2019s nuclear weapons programme was established and overt.",
  "Through the1998testsandthe subsequent rapiddevelopments inIndo-US relations,Indiahad",
  "becomeade jurenuclear statedespitebeing outsideinternationalproliferation controls\u2014giving",
  "her a unique international status. Displaying a proven nuclear weapons capability within a",
  "conservative and defensive doctrine, India had shown her technological and scienti\ufb01c prowess",
  "to the world. These capabilities had increased India\u2019s (and South Asia\u2019s) prominence and",
  "importance in international relations (especially for the USA) and further bolstered India\u2019s",
  "aspirations to become a Great Power. In turn, India\u2019s domestic nuclear energy programme",
  "bene\ufb01tedfrom the 1998tests,asadecade latershe surmounted theinternational safeguardsthat",
  "hadatone timerestricted her.Aiding hercontinued economic growth andenergysecurity, the",
  "signing of civilian nuclear agreements with the USA, France and Russia con\ufb01rmed the success",
  "of this trajectory and \ufb01rmly placed her in the group of established nuclear powers.",
  "However, what of the paradox of weaponization and disarmament underpinning India\u2019s",
  "nuclear policy? While India\u2019s leaders had rallied against the \u2018nuclear haves\u2019, with the 1998 tests",
  "and their aftermath India appeared to have joined the nuclear apartheid which it abhorred.",
  "Even though she has yet to join the NPT or CTBT, India enjoys the privileges of the P-5",
  "powers whereby they do not need to have their military nuclear facilities monitored. India\u2019s",
  "leaders have displayed remarkable tenacity to get her to this position, but it is unclear whether",
  "they will continue to pursue India\u2019s disarmament goals or now acquiesce to an international",
  "regime which their country has e\ufb00ectively joined. This situation is compounded by India\u2019s",
  "growing strategic nuclear capabilities, most particularly its recent acquisition of a \u2018nuclear triad\u2019",
  "that gives her the ability to launch nuclear weapons from land, air and sea. Such an ability puts",
  "IndiaonaparwiththeUSA,RussiaandChina.Continuedmissiledevelopmentalsoresultedin",
  "the successful testing in February 2010 of the Agni-III, which with a range of 3,500 km is",
  "capable of hitting Beijing, and which made India China\u2019s clear strategic rival.",
  "Thus, while India\u2019s leaders continue to talk of disarmament, the morality of such aims has",
  "diminished in the face of India acquiring atomic weapons. This change suggests not so much",
  "that India\u2019s nuclear paradox has been lost, but simply underlined as a multi-faceted tool with",
  "which she can continue to gain her aspiration to Great Power status. Indeed, some Indian",
