  "Introduction",
  "The camaraderie that characterizes India-Afghanistan relations both at the political and popular",
  "level is a product not merely of modern geopolitics but is also a testimony to the historico-",
  "cultural linkages that have existed between Afghanistan and the Indian subcontinent since",
  "ancient times.1 The partition of British India in 1947 ruptured India\u2019s geographical contiguity",
  "with Afghanistan, but not the warmth that characterized their relations; this stood in sharp",
  "contrast to Pakistan, which, in spiteof its geographical contiguity as well as religious and ethnic",
  "congruity, has seen its relations with Kabul for most of its history being clouded by bitterness",
  "andadeep senseofdistrust. India\u2019srole inAfghanistan has re-emerged intoimportance not just",
  "for Afghanistan and the region, but also as \u2018a test case for a rising power\u2019\u2014India.2 Afghanistan\u2019s",
  "importance for India and others is largely geopolitical, as Afghanistan faces southwards down",
  "from the Hindu Kush into the Indian subcontinent, India\u2019s immediate neighbourhood. Yet it also",
  "looks northwards down from the Hindu Kush into India\u2019s extended neighbourhood, in which",
  "\u2018Afghanistan is the fractious gateway to and from Central Asia, which de\ufb01nes the way other",

  "further complemented India-Afghanistan bilateral ties. Relations between the two states",
  "remained warm and both sides maintained deep cultural and modest economic links.",
  "The \ufb01rst formidable challenge to India\u2019s Afghanistan policy came in the wake of the Soviet",

  "policy of non-alignment. The then Prime Minister, Chaudhary Charan Singh, categorically",
  "opposed Soviet intervention and called for an immediate withdrawal of Soviet troops. How-",
  "ever, this stand was short lived and was reversed when Indira Gandhi made a dramatic political",
  "comeback and was re-elected to o\ufb03ce in January 1980.4 She stated that Soviet troops were",
  "introducedintoAfghanistan\u2018onlyafterPakistanstartedtrainingAfghanrebelsandsendingthem",
  "in to topple the government there [\u2026] nevertheless India was opposed to the USSR\u2019s presence",
  "and it had told that country so\u2019.5 However, despite its discomfort with Soviet military presence",
  "in its neighbourhood, India, while steering clear of an unequivocal endorsement of Soviet",
  "military intervention, consistently chose to abstain on key UN resolutions calling for Soviet",
  "withdrawal from Afghanistan.",
  "India\u2019s response to the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan was essentially conditioned by the",
  "followingfourkeyfactors:\ufb01rst,Washington\u2019seconomicaid,supplyofsophisticatedarmsandF-",
  "16 \ufb01ghter aircrafts to Pakistan; second, Washington\u2019s rapprochement with Beijing in which",
  "Islamabad had played a key role; third, a US naval build-up in the Indian Ocean region;6 and",
  "fourth, afear of mujahideen victory givingPakistan clear strategic leverage in Afghanistan. Given",
  "these complexgeopolitical realities, India could not a\ufb00ord to jeopardize its partnership with the",
  "USSR, which had emerged as its major supplier of defence equipment and space technology,",
  "and which played a key role in extending support to India at key international forums on cri-",
  "tical issues such asKashmir andthe Bangladesh war of 1971, in face ofsti\ufb00 oppositionfrom the",
  "USA and People\u2019s Republic of China.",
  "India\u2019srecognition ofthepro-Kremlinregimein Kabul\u2014making ittheonlycountryoutside",
  "the Warsaw Pact to do so\u2014did to an extent undermine India\u2019s moral stature, especially in the",
  "Non-Aligned Movement (NAM), and to an extent also sullied India\u2019s image within Afghani-",
  "stan.Subsequently,NewDelhi\u2019sdecisionin1982torestoretheIndo-AfghanJointCommission",
  "constituted in the early 1970s for economic and technical assistance and lying in abeyance since",
  "the Saur Revolution in 1978, further eroded India\u2019s position on the international stage.",
  "India supported all Moscow-backed governments in Kabul and extended modest develop-",
  "mental assistance to the Najibullah regime, in spite of Najibullah\u2019s increasingly fragile control",
  "over the country. However, within months of the Soviet collapse the Najibullah regime, too,",
  "had dramatically unravelled, and was replaced by a fragile coalition of mujahideen forces with",
  "Badrudin Rabbani at the helm. Given the extremely limited room for political manoeuvring,",
  "India cast its lot with Rabbani notwithstanding its apprehensions of Rabbani\u2019s own Islamist",
  "Jamat-e-Islami background and endorsement of Pakistan\u2019s position on Kashmir\u2014a clear break",
  "from the policy adopted by preceding regimes of Kabul. However, factionalism was rife in",
  "Rabbani\u2019s mujahideen, and this ensured its demise which once again plunged Afghanistan into a",
  "brutal civil war.",
  "Indiasu\ufb00ered itsgreatest strategic setback in Afghanistan withthe rise ofthe Pakistan-backed",
  "Taliban to the political centre stage in 1996. New Delhi refused to recognize the extremist",

  "nullah, was to emerge as \u2018a centre of world smuggling for narcotic drugs. Afghanistan will be",
  "turned into a centre for terrorism\u2019.7 For India, the fallout of the rise of fundamentalism in",
  "Afghanistan was ferocious and almost immediate, as it witnessed the rise of what proved to be",

  "New Delhi\u2019s deep antipathy towards the Taliban brought it onto a common platform with",
  "Tehran and Moscow, which supported the predominantly Tajik Northern Alliance whose",
  "control over Afghanistan was reduced to a mere 10% of the territory in the extreme north.",
  "Indian support to the opposition was routed through its base in Farakhor in Tajikistan. The",
  "events that ensued in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks on the USA on 11 September 2001",
  "were principally responsible for tilting the scales in favour of the opposition Northern Alliance",
  "and unseating the Taliban from power within a matter of weeks. As Ramachandran noted, \u2018in",
  "Afghanistan, Pakistan\u2019s loss is India\u2019s gain\u2019.10",
  "Subsequently, India has managed to e\ufb00ectively claw its way back into Afghanistan\u2019s power",
  "equations, at least for the near future. The India-educated Hamid Karzai, a Pushtun, came to",
  "power \ufb01rst as head of the interim government and has since been re-elected twice as President.",
  "Karzai adopted a policy of rekindling Kabul\u2019s close ties with New Delhi. This is borne out in",
  "particular by two signi\ufb01cant symbolic gestures: \ufb01rst, the visit of then foreign minister Abdullah",
  "Abdullah and defence minister Mohammad Qasim Fahim to India within three months of the",
  "installation of the interim government; and second, the choice of New Delhi as the \ufb01rst desti-",
  "nation by national carrier Ariana on its inaugural run overlooking all the other six geo-",
  "graphically contiguous neighbours of Afghanistan. India has attempted to give greater traction",
  "to its e\ufb00orts to secure its interests in Afghanistan by engaging in diplomatic parleys with Kabul",
  "at the highest level, Karzai has visited India seven times since taking charge, while in 2005",
  "Prime Minister Manmohan Singh paid a state visit to Kabul, signi\ufb01cantly the \ufb01rst such visit by",
  "an Indian head of state in three decades.",
  "Today, India is recognized as a key regional player in e\ufb00orts to stabilize Afghanistan and for",
  "the \ufb01rst time there is a broad congruity of Indian and US interests in Afghanistan: both wish to",
  "see a stable, democratic and multi-ethnic political solution take root in the country. India",
  "moved swiftly to deepen its footprint in Afghanistan by opening its embassy in Kabul and four",
  "other consulates in Jalalabad (eastern Afghanistan), Herat (northern Afghanistan), Kandahar",
  "(southern Afghanistan) and Mazar-e-Sharif (western Afghanistan). In addition, India also",
  "unveiled a US $1,200m. aid programme\u2014a substantial amount for a traditionally non-donor",
  "country\u2014making it the largest regional and \ufb01fth largest international donor. Indian aid projects",
  "spread across various sectors, ranging from o\ufb00ering 500 annual scholarships for Afghan students,",
  "provision of vocational training activities for women, construction of roads, dams, transmission",
  "lines and telecom networks, to the construction of the new Afghanistan parliament building.11",
  "Commenting on the Indian aid programme, the Pakistani analyst Ahmed Rashid reckoned that",
  "\u2018India\u2019s reconstruction strategy was designed to win over every sector of Afghan society, give",
  "India a high pro\ufb01le with Afghans, gain the maximum political advantage and of course,",
  "undercut Pakistani in\ufb02uence\u2019.12",
  "India\u2019s interests in Afghanistan",
  "Indian e\ufb00orts in Afghanistan are underpinned by the following three key objectives: negating",
  "the in\ufb02uence of Pakistani Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI)-backed groups like the Taliban,",
  "which are hostile to Indian interests in the neighbourhood; curtailing the spread of drugs-traf-",
  "\ufb01cking, which poses a risk to both national and human security in the region; and securing",
  "Afghanistan as a trade and energy corridor to Central Asia.",

  "strategic depth for the Pakistan army in case of war with India and ensuring the continuity",
  "of Arab and Afghan militancy in Indian Kashmir [\u2026] most of the Islamic militant groups",
  "that are now \ufb01ghting in Kashmir, including Harkat-ul-Mujahideen, are products of the",
  "Afghan war. The Taliban are an important external agent in fuelling the \ufb01re of Islamic",
  "militancy in Kashmir.14",

  "beencloselyidenti\ufb01edwiththeNorthernAlliance,whichisprimarilycomposedofthreeethnic",
  "minorities in Afghanistan\u2014the Tajiks who constitute approximately 27% cent of the popula-",
  "tion,andtheHazarasandUzbekswhoconstituteapproximately9%eachofthepopulation.Itis",
  "imperativethatIndiae\ufb00ectively capitalizesonsomeofitskeydevelopmental projectslocatedin",

  "Government and encourage working towards evolving a multi-ethnic political solution to the",
  "Afghan quagmire. Addressing this challenge is crucial if India wishes to counter propaganda of",
  "supporting the northern tribes against the Pushtuns, who largely dominate the ranks of the",
  "Taliban.",
  "Second, in light of the Taliban insurgency having gained a lethal momentum and with an",
  "impatientWestwillingtonegotiateandbuyitswayout,Indiawillhaveto\ufb01ndcreativewaysto",
  "retain its relevance as a consequential player in Afghanistan. The changes in the composition of",
  "the erstwhile Northern Alliance, the rise in Islamabad\u2019s in\ufb02uence as demonstrated at the",
  "London Conference and subsequently at the Istanbul security conference on Afghanistan, to",
  "which India was not even invited, have further magni\ufb01ed the challenge at hand.",

  "Third, India also needs to e\ufb00ectively leverage its soft power prowess in Afghanistan and",
  "reinforce itwith a more active role in the country\u2019s military sector. This couldbe done by way",
  "of scaling up the very modest levels of training being currently o\ufb00ered to the Afghan National",
  "Police and the Afghan National Army. Such an exercise, apart from being far more cost e\ufb00ec-",
  "tive than the training programmes being o\ufb00ered by the West, hold out two other distinct",
  "advantages: namely, that there is a far greater degree of trust between India and Afghanistan as",
  "compared with the West orwith any of Afghanistan\u2019s neighbouring countries, and also because",
  "India is culturally much closer to the Afghans, thus making communication and establishment",
  "of bonds with the soldiers far easier. In addition, India has the capacity and capability to o\ufb00er",
  "expertise in counter-insurgency training to Afghan forces atits elite training academies in India.",
  "However, for this to materialize, India would have to engage in some tactful diplomacy with",
  "Washington and other Western capitals in order to soothe the frayed nerves that such a move",
  "would cause in Islamabad.",
  "Finally, pressure on New Delhi from Washington is likely to intensify for not only a",
  "resumption of its stalled composite dialogue process with Pakistan, but also for arriving at a",
  "solutionontheissueofKashmir.ThedominantsentimentprevalentinWesternpolicycirclesis",
  "underscored by Chief of Sta\ufb00 Admiral Michael Mullen\u2019s statement that \u2018the longstanding ani-",
  "mosity and mistrust between Pakistan and India complicates regional e\ufb00orts [\u2026] we must o\ufb00er",
  "our help to improve con\ufb01dence and understanding between them in a manner that builds long",
  "term stability across the wider region of South Asia\u2019.31",
  "Potential developments for India in Afghanistan",
  "The political alignments and re-alignments underway in Afghanistan triggered by an intensify-",
  "ing Taliban insurgency and waning commitment of the West are likely to give rise to four key",
  "developments that will have reverberations for India in the near future.",
  "First, with the West accepting Pakistan\u2019s o\ufb00er of using its leverage (especially with the Haq-",
  "qanigroup) to broker whatappears to beat besta tenuous peace,Islamabad will betempted to",
  "once again look upon Afghanistan as its \u2018strategic depth\u2019 against India and the Taliban as a",
  "strategic leverage. The thinking within the Pakistani establishment on this particular issue and",
  "the weight attached to it is lucidly demonstrated by the Pakistan army chief\u2019s recent statement",
  "that \u2018we want to have strategic depth in Afghanistan\u2019.32 Former ISI chief Hamid Gul\u2014who",
  "played an instrumental role in propping up the mujahideen both in Afghanistan, and later sup-",
  "ported insurgency in Punjab and Kashmir and was also closely associated with Lashkar-e-Taiba,",
  "which was believed to be behind the 2008 terrorist attacks on Mumbai\u2014was even more blunt",
  "when publicly proclaiming that, \u2018America is history, Karzai is history, and the Taliban are the",
  "future\u2019.33 Thus, India\u2019s old security concerns emanating from Afghanistan are likely to be",
  "rekindled.However,anotherkeypointofconcernforNewDelhiwillbethatthistime,witha",
  "politico-militaryre-emergenceoftheTaliban,therealsoexistsastrongpossibilityoftheTaliban",
  "using Pakistan\u2019s lawless frontier regions as its own strategic depth. This would bring the threat",
  "posedbyextremist groups much closerto India\u2019s geographical aswell aspsychologicalfrontiers.",
  "Second, with India\u2019s political in\ufb02uence being clipped in Afghanistan its e\ufb00orts to project",
  "power, in what New Delhi considers to be its extended neighbourhood of energy-rich Central",
  "Asia, will su\ufb00er a setback, as will its e\ufb00orts to bolster energy security. Furthermore, as radical",
  "Islamist groups such as the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan (IMU) increasingly forge transna-",
  "tional linkages, particularly with the ISI and Taliban, security challenges on India\u2019s western",
  "frontiers are likely to multiply. Developments in Afghanistan will inescapably have trans-border",
  "reverberations in the Central Asian republics (CARs), three of which, apart from being",

  "India\u2019srelationswithAfghanistan",
  "geographically proximate, have cross-ethnic linkages with Afghanistan. A spill-over of Afghan",
  "instability in the already fragile CARs could disrupt India\u2019s growing interest in the region,",
  "especially its growing military co-operation with states like Tajikistan, which is believed to be",
  "hosting India\u2019s \ufb01rst ever foreign military outpost at Ayni.",
  "Third,astheWestutilizestheservicesofIslamabadtoreachouttotheTaliban,itwillalsobe",
  "attracted to Islamabad\u2019s proposition that Kashmir, too, is a major cause for fuelling pan-Islamic",
  "radicalism. Thus, major Western capitals will be tempted to put renewed pressure on New",
  "Delhi to resolve the issue of Kashmir. India must demonstrate greater dexterity with regard to",
  "its policies of engagement with Pakistan if it is to pre-empt e\ufb00orts being made to hyphenate it",
  "with\u2018Af-Pak\u2019.Moreover,anotherpotentialareaofconcernforIndiaislikelytobethevariance",
  "of its stance with the USA towards groups such as Lashkar-e-Taiba, which are of immediate",
  "concern for New Delhi. This di\ufb00erence in threat perception is underscored by US Secretary of",
  "DefenceRobertGates\u2019srecentproclamationbeforetheSenateforeignrelationscommittee\u2018that",
  "Al Qaeda is supportive of Lashkar-e-Toiba [\u2026] Al Qaeda is providing them with targeting",
  "information and helping them in their plotting in India\u2019.34 Such a view goes distinctly against",
  "the widely held Indian view that the real sponsors of Lashkar-e-Taiba are at the ISI head-",
  "quarters in Pakistan.",
  "Fourth, the role played by Beijing in Afghanistan in coming years will be closely watched in",
  "New Delhi. Beijing\u2019s past record of \ufb02irting with radical Islamist movements,35 as also its extre-",
  "mely close alliance with Pakistan through which it hopes to pacify Xinjiang while on the",
  "externalplaneusethisalliancetotemperarisingIndianpro\ufb01leinbothAfghanistan andCentral",
  "Asia, has all helped deepen suspicions in New Delhi about Beijing\u2019s intentions in the region.",
  "Indian discomfort can been seen over Beijing\u2019s linkages between Pakistan and Afghanistan,",
  "Chinese linkagestypi\ufb01edin aPeople\u2019s Daily editorial that\u2018the USmust ensure a stable domestic",
  "and international environment for Pakistan and ease the tension between Pakistan and India[\u2026",
  "The]Afghanproblem,thePakistaniproblemandtheIndian-Pakistaniproblemareallrelated\u2019.36",
  "Even more discomforting for India was the fact that this sentiment found echo in the joint",
  "statement issued after President Obama\u2019s visit to Beijing in November 2009, which said \u2018they",
  "[the USA and China] support the e\ufb00orts of Afghanistan and Pakistan to \ufb01ght terrorism, main-",
  "tain domestic stability and achieve sustainable economic and social development, and support",
  "the improvement and growth of relations between India and Pakistan. The two sides are ready",
  "to strengthen communication, dialogue and cooperation on issues related to South Asia and",
  "work together to promote peace, stability and development in that region\u2019.37 Signals like these",
  "from Beijing have hardened suspicions of mandarins in New Delhi, who believe that Beijing\u2019s",
  "real intention is to re-hyphenate India with Pakistan and strengthen the case for India as being",
  "part of the problem and not the solution.",
  "Conclusions",
  "As the international community desperately attempts to \ufb01nd a way to extricate itself from the",
  "Afghan quagmire, India may increasingly \ufb01nd itself hemmed in by the powers that be. A di\ufb03-",
  "cult road lies ahead for India in the summer of 2010 over its Afghanistan policy, in which if",
  "India aspires to be a consequential player in Afghan a\ufb00airs and pre-empt political margin-",
  "alization, \u2018New Delhi must recalibrate its strategic calculus in Afghanistan\u2019 by playing a pro-",
  "active role in the political re-alignments taking place in Kabul, as opposed to viewing them",
  "with disdain.38 New Delhi needs to broaden its political engagement outside the ambit of the",
  "KabulGovernment;thiswillbeimperativeifitdesirestopreventPakistan\u2019sISIfromonceagain",
  "having a free run. All its attempts to usher in development will be rendered ine\ufb00ectual if not",

  "observed, as New Delhi increasingly jockeys for a position at the global high table.",
