  "Time and again, India\u2019s behaviour in the realm of foreign and security policy has confounded",
  "observers, deviating as it does from the \u2018norm\u2019 set by other major powers. Indian foreign and",
  "security policy has been deemed incoherent and inconsistent.1 As India\u2019s weight has grown in",
  "the international system in recent years, there is a perception that India is on the cusp of",
  "achieving GreatPower status. It is repeated adnauseum in the Indian and oftenin global media,",

  "Today, when India wants to shape the international system as opposed to being merely its",
  "referent object, it should be expected that its foreign policy will be anchored on a planned",
  "augmentation of the power of the nation as a whole. Some are indeed suggesting that after",
  "years of rejecting power politics and emphasizing the importance of international norms, India has",

  "state behaviour but also how states perceive themselves, what is called a stateidentity.5 Cultural",
  "elements of a state\u2019s domestic environment, thereby, become an important factor shaping the",
  "national security interests and the security policies of states.",
  "While critics have argued that culture does not matter in global politics and foreign policy,",
  "and cultural e\ufb00ects can be reduced to epiphenomena of the distribution of power and cap-",
  "abilities, one can surely examine culture as one of the variables shaping a state\u2019s foreign policy",
  "even if there are reasons to be cautious about using culture to explain political outcomes.",
  "Strategic culture de\ufb01cit",
  "India\u2019s ability to think strategically on issues of national security has been considered at best",
  "questionable. George Tanham, in his landmark study on Indian strategic thought, pointed out",
  "that Indian elites have shown little evidence of having thought coherently and systematically",
  "about national strategy. He argued that this lack of long-term planning and strategy derives",
  "from India\u2019s historical and cultural developmental patterns. These include the Hindu view of",
  "lifeaslargelyunknowable,therebybeingoutsideman\u2019scontrol,andtheHinduconceptoftime",
  "aseternal,therebydiscouragingplanning.Asaconsequence,TanhamarguedthatIndiahasbeen",
  "on the strategic defensive throughout its history, reluctant to assert itself except within the",
  "subcontinent.6 In a similar vein, Sandy Gordon suggests that \u2018the hierarchical nature of caste",
  "naturally leads to a propensity towards compartmentalization and exclusivity\u2019, which \u2018under-",
  "mines seriously coordination and planning\u2019.7",
  "India\u2019s former Minister of External A\ufb00airs, Jaswant Singh, also examined the evolution of",
  "strategic culture in Indian society and in its political decision-making class, with a particular",
  "reference to post-independence India. He considered the Indian political elites as not thinking",
  "strategicallyaboutforeignpolicyanddefenceissues;withhisgunsparticularlytrainedonIndia\u2019s",
  "\ufb01rst Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, he pointed to Nehru\u2019s \u2018idealistic romanticism\u2019 and his",
  "unwillingness to institutionalize strategic thinking, policy formulation and implementation.8",
  "Itisironic,however,thatevenwhenSinghwashimselfMinisterofExternalA\ufb00airsin1998\u2013",
  "2002,therewaslittleevidencethatanythingofsubstancereallychangedinsofarasthestrategic",
  "dimension of India\u2019s foreign policy is concerned. For all the blame that Singh laid at Nehru\u2019s",
  "door, even he and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led government in which he served did not",
  "move towards the institutionalization of strategic thinking, policy formulation and imple-",
  "mentation. Perhaps the Indian strategic culture became too powerful a constraint for even him",
  "to overcome?",
  "Critics of these views have argued that claims made by Tanham and others regarding India\u2019s",
  "lack of strategic culture can not only be refuted easily but such arguments also lack methodo-",
  "logicalrigour.9OthershavesuggestedthatTanhamisbeingethnocentricinhisclaimsaboutthe",
  "impact of culture on Indian thinking.10 In response to Tanham\u2019s argument that India lacks a",
  "tradition of strategic thinking, it has been suggested that \u2018India has had strategy and grand",
  "strategy, and one could distil these from Indian pronouncements and behaviour, but it cannot",
  "produce a canon of strategic thought of any great lineage, and certainly not comparable to",
  "Europe\u2019s\u2019.11 Others see bureaucratic inertia, political ineptitude and the state of civil-military",
  "relations as factors responsible for the absence of strategic thinking in India.12",
  "However, contra Tanham, an analysis of the strategic behaviour of \ufb01ve pan-Indian powers",
  "spanning over two millennia\u2014the Mauryas, the Guptas, the Mughals, British India and the",
  "Republic of India\u2014suggests a remarkable continuity. These \ufb01ve powers, according to this",
  "argument, seem to have followed a similar grand strategic paradigm that includes a drive",
  "towards power maximization under the veneer of morality, striving for regional hegemony in",

  "Yet with the exception of the Arthasastra, attributed to the ancient Indian scholar Kautilya,",
  "thereisnomajorwrittentextthathasactuallyrecordedIndianstrategicthinking.BeforeIndia\u2019s",
  "emergence as a nation-state in 1947, Indian strategic culture was projected through Lord",
  "Wellesly\u2019s Subsidiary Alliance system, whereby various Indian rulers were prepared to outsource",
  "their security to the British Raj and live under its protection. Unlike China, which has a tra-",
  "dition of a strong central state dominating the lives of the people, in India Society has always",
  "been more important than the State. This was one of the reasons why India welcomed Queen",

  "Jawaharlal Nehru dominated the Indian foreign and security policy landscape in the",
  "immediate aftermath of Indian independence till his death in 1964. It was his worldview that",
  "shaped Indian foreign policy priorities and Indian strategic culture can be viewed through the",
  "prism of Nehruvian predilections. Nehru was a strategic thinker and his non-alignment was a",
  "classic\u2018balanceofpower\u2019policyinabipolarworldwherethetwosuperpowerscouldnot goto",
  "war because of nuclear weapons. He was an internationalist. However, nonalignment was",
  "reduced to a dogma and an ideology after him and became in e\ufb00ect isolationism. India was",
  "forced to alter its economic and foreign policies because of the grave economic crisis in the",
  "early 1990s. Isolationism did not lead to a careful assessment of the dynamic international",
  "security situation and exploration of options for India.",
  "For a long time there was a myth propagated by the political elites in the country that there",
  "was a general consensus across political parties on major foreign policy issues. Aside from the",
  "fact that such a consensus has been more a result of intellectual apathy than any real attempt to",
  "forge a coherent grand strategy that cuts across ideological barriers, this is most certainly an",
  "exaggeration, as until the early 1990s the Congress Party\u2019s dominance over the Indian political",
  "landscape was almost complete and there wasno political organization of an equal capacity that",
  "could bring to bear its in\ufb02uence on foreign and security policy issues in the same measure. It",
  "was the rise of the Hindu nationalist BJP that gave India a signi\ufb01cantly di\ufb00erent voice on for-",
  "eign policy, but more importantly it was the changes in the international environment that",
  "forced Indian policy-makers to challenge some of the assumptions underlying their approach to",
  "the outside world.",
  "If we de\ufb01ne strategic culture more narrowly in terms of its three basic components\u2014political",
  "military culture (civil-military relations), domestic attitudes towards the use of force, and",
  "domestic political culture\u2014then it becomes easier to identify how these three have shaped",
  "Indian foreign policy and security behaviour.14",

  "Indianpoliticiansafterindependencein1947viewedtheIndianArmywithsuspicionasthelast",
  "supportersoftheBritishRajanddidtheirbesttoisolatethemilitaryfrom policyandin\ufb02uence.",
  "This attitude was further reinforced by the views of two giants of the Indian nationalist move-",
  "ment, Mahatma Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru. Gandhi\u2019s ardent belief in non-violence (ahimsa)",
  "left little room for accepting the role of the use of force in an independent India. It also shaped",
  "the views on military and defence of the \ufb01rst generation of post-independence political leaders",
  "in India. More important, though, has been the legacy of Nehru, India\u2019s \ufb01rst Prime Minister,",
  "who laid the institutional foundations for civil-military relations in India. His obsession with",

  "the sidelining of defence planning in India.15",
  "By institutionalizing civilian supremacy over the country\u2019s military apparatus, Nehru also",
  "ensured that the experiences in neighbouring Pakistan, where military had become the",
  "dominant political force soon after independence, would not be repeated in India. The Indian",
  "civilian elite also did not want the emergence of a rival military elite with direct access to",
  "political leadership. Two signi\ufb01cant changes immediately after independence that reduced the",
  "in\ufb02uence of the military and strengthened civilian control were the abolition of the post of",
  "Commander-in-Chief, which had hitherto been the main military adviser to the government,",
  "and the strengthening of the civilian-led Ministry of Defence.16 Other organizational changes",
  "followed that further strengthened civilian hold over the armed forces. The Indian national",
  "security decision-making system was devised by Lord Ismay, Mountbatten\u2019s Chief of Sta\ufb00",
  "during Partition in 1947, and handed over to a civilian government and military leaderships,",
  "both of which were amateurs in matters of national security. The Army, Navy and Air Force",
  "Acts passed during 1947\u201350 made those forces independent juridical entities outside the",
  "government, leading to the creation of a civilian Ministry of Defence with Armed Forces",
  "Commands staying outside the government. It has been argued that as a consequence, India is",
  "among only a handful of nations where civilian administrations wield so much power over the",
  "military.17",
  "Along with Nehru, another civilian who left a lasting impact on the evolution of civil-mili-",
  "tary relations was V.K. Krishna Menon, India\u2019s Minister of Defence in 1957\u201362. During his",
  "tenure, which has been described as the most controversial stewardship of the Indian defence",
  "ministry, he heralded a number of organizational changes that were not very popular with the",
  "armed forces.18 The \ufb01rst major civil-military clash in independent India also took place under",
  "his watch, when B.K. Thimayya, the then well-respected Chief of Army, decided to bypass",
  "Menon in 1959 and went straight to the Prime Minister with his litany of complaints, which",
  "included, among others, Menon\u2019s interference in the administration of the armed forces. The",
  "situation was so precarious that Thimayya even submitted his resignation to Nehru, which he",
  "was persuaded to withdraw later.19 While this episode demonstrated that the strength of civil-",
  "military relations in India in so far as Thimayya used the due process to challenge his civilian",
  "superior, it also revealed the dangers of civilian intervention in matters that the military feels",
  "belong to its domain. The consequences ofsuch civil-military friction was to begrave for India",
  "in the 1962 war with China.",
  "Despite any military experience, Nehru and Menon were actively involved in operational-",
  "level planning before the outbreak of the Sino-Indian war of 1962. They \u2018directly supervised",
  "the placement of individual brigades, companies, and even platoons, as the Chinese and Indian",
  "forces engaged in mutual encirclement of isolated outposts\u2019.20 As a consequence, when China",

  "while Nehru\u2019s reputation su\ufb00ered lasting damage. It also made it clear, both to the civilians",
  "and the military, that purely operational matters were best left to the military. Some have",
  "argued that since then a convention has been established whereby while the operational direc-",

  "Stephen Rosen, in his study of the impact of societal structures on the military e\ufb00ectiveness",
  "ofastate, arguesthat theseparation oftheIndianmilitary from Indiansociety, whilepreserving",
  "the coherence of the Indian army, has led to a reduction in the e\ufb00ective military power of the",

  "Military power, more often than not, a\ufb00ects the success with which other instruments of",
  "statecraft are employed, as it always lurks in the background of inter-state relations, even when",
  "nations are at peace with each other. Military power remains central to the course of interna-",
  "tional politics as force retains its role as the \ufb01nal arbiter among states in an anarchical interna-",
  "tional system.26 States may not always need to resort to the actual use of force, but military",
  "power vitally a\ufb00ects the manner in which states deal with each other even during peace time,",

  "Discomfort with power",
  "A fundamental quandary that has long dogged India in the realm of foreign a\ufb00airs, which has",
  "become even more acute with India\u2019s ascent in the international order, is the need, as Sunil",

  "Hans Morgenthau, the arch advocate of International Relations (IR) realism, once famously",

  "challenges that India faced as it continued to strive for sustained economic growth, his dis-",

  "polity. This ambivalence about the use of power in international relations, where \u2018any prestige",

  "that in large measure have allowed Indian democracy to thrive and \ufb02ourish for more than 50",
  "years now, despite a number of constraints that have led to the failure of democracy in many",
  "other societies. However, in the realm of foreign policy it is the lack of institutionalization that",
  "has allowed a drift to set in without any long-term orientation.",
  "Some have laid the blame on Nehru for his unwillingness to construct strategic planning",
  "architecture because he single-handedly shaped Indian foreign policy during his tenure.36 Even",
  "his successors, however, have failed to pursue institutionalization in a consistent manner. The",
  "BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) came to power in 1999 promising that it would",
  "establish a National Security Council (NSC) to analyse the military, economic and political",
  "threats to the nation and to advise the government on meeting these challenges e\ufb00ectively.",
  "While it did set up the NSC in the late 1990s and de\ufb01ned its role in policy formulation, the",
  "BJP neglected the institutionalization of the NSC and the building up of its capabilities to play",
  "the role assigned to it, thereby failing to underpin national security by structural and systematic",
  "institutional arrangements. Important national security decisions were taken in an ad hoc",

  "an optimal manner whereby the NSC anticipates national security threats, co-ordinates the",

  "bold ideas. An e\ufb00ective foreign policy institutional framework would not only identify the",
  "challenges, but would also develop a coherent strategy to deal with it, organize and motivate",
  "the bureaucracy, and persuade and inform the public. The NSC, by itself, is not a panacea,",
  "particularly in light of the inability of the NSC in the USA to successfully mediate in the",
  "bureaucratic wars and e\ufb00ectively co-ordinate policy. However, the lack of an e\ufb00ective NSC in",
  "India is re\ufb02ective of India\u2019s ad hoc decision-making process in the realm of foreign policy. If",
  "there is any continuity in India\u2019s approach to foreign policy and national security, it is the",

  "There is clearly an appreciation in Indian policy-making circles of India\u2019s rising capabilities. It is",
  "re\ufb02ected in a gradual expansion of Indian foreign policy activity in recent years, in India\u2019s",
  "attempt to reshape its defence forces, in its desire to seek greater global in\ufb02uence. As India has",
  "risen in the global inter-state hierarchy in recent years, three di\ufb00erent streams of thinking have",
  "been identi\ufb01ed in the Indian strategic discourse: Nehruvianism, neoliberalism and hyper-rea-",
  "lism.38 It is not entirely clear if these three \u2018schools\u2019 of Indian strategic thinking can generate",
  "long-term direction for the country. Indian grand strategy continues to be marked by its",
  "absence.",

  "Since foreign policy issues do not tend to win votes, there is little incentive for political",
  "parties to devote serious attention to them and the result is ad hoc responses to various crises as",
  "they emerge. It is possible that with faster economic growth and increased interaction with the",
  "international community, Indian strategic culture will undergo a change in the coming years. If",
  "the past is any guide, then this process might take much longer than expected.",
