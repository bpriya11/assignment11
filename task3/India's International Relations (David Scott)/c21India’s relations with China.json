  "Introduction",
  "According to most political observers, the global political architecture is undergoing a transfor-",
  "mation,withpowerincreasinglyshiftingfromtheWesttotheEast,inwhathasbeencalledthe",
  "\u2018Asian Century\u2019. The two most populous nations on the earth, the People\u2019s Republic of China",
  "and India, are on their way to becoming economic powerhouses and are shedding their reti-",
  "cence in asserting their global pro\ufb01les, all of which makes their relationship of still greater",
  "importance to the international system. The future of this Asian Century will to a large extent",
  "depend upon the relationship between the two regional giants, China and India, and the",
  "bilateralrelationshipbetweenChinaandIndiawillde\ufb01nethecontoursofthenewinternational",
  "politicalarchitectureinAsiaandtheworldatlarge.Theimportanceoftheirrelationshiphasnot",
  "been lost on China and India. In one of his meetings with the Indian Prime Minister, at the",
  "2004 Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM), the Chinese Premier, Wen Jiabao, was reported to have",
  "remarked that \u2018when we shake hands, the whole world will be watching\u2019. As of today, how-",
  "ever, the trajectory of the Sino-Indian relationship remains as complex as ever to decipher,",
  "despite some positive developments in the last few years. This chapter examines the evolution",
  "of Sino-Indian ties over the last few decades and the constraints that continue to inhibit this",
  "relationship from achieving its full potential.",
  "Initial encounters",
  "As two ancient civilizations, India and China have had cultural and trade ties since at least the",
  "\ufb01rst century. The famous Silk Road allowed for economic and trade ties to develop between",
  "the two, with the transmission of Buddhism from India to China giving a further cultural",
  "dimension to the relationship between the two neighbours. The political ties between China",
  "and India, however, remained underdeveloped.",
  "Independent India\u2019s \ufb01rst Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, saw anti-imperialist friendship",
  "between the two largest states of Asia as imperative if the interference by the two external",
  "superpowers was to be avoided.1 Solidarity with China was integral to Nehru\u2019s vision of Asian",

  "leadership. After the People\u2019s Republic of China was established in 1949, and India established",
  "diplomatic ties with it in 1950, India not only advocated for China\u2019s membership at the UN",
  "but also opposed attempts to condemn China for its actions in Korea. Yet the issue of Tibet",
  "soonemerged asthe majorbone ofcontention between China andIndia.China wassuspicious",
  "of Indian designs on Tibet, which India sought to ally by supporting the Seventeen-Point",
  "Agreement between Tibetan delegates and China in 1951, which recognized China\u2019s sover-",
  "eignty over Tibet and guaranteed the existing socio-political arrangements of Tibet. India and",
  "China signed the famed Panchshila agreement in 1954, which underlined the Five Principles of",
  "Peaceful Co-existence as forming the basis of their bilateral relationship.2 These principles",
  "included mutual respect for each other\u2019s territorial integrity and sovereignty; mutual non-",
  "aggression; mutual non-interference in each other\u2019s internal a\ufb00airs; equality and mutual bene\ufb01t;",
  "and peaceful co-existence. These were the hey-days of Sino-Indian ties, with the Hindi-China",
  "bhai-bhai (\u2018the Indians and Chinese are brothers\u2019) phrase a favourite slogan for the seeming",
  "camaraderie between the two states.",
  "However, this was not to last for long. Soon the border dispute between China and India",
  "escalated and led to the 1962 Sino-Indian war.3 Though a short war, it was to have a long-",
  "lasting impact on Sino-Indian ties. It demolished Nehru\u2019s claims of Asian solidarity, and the",
  "defeat at the hands of the Chinese psychologically scarred Indian military and political elites. It",
  "led to China developing close ties with India\u2019s neighbouring adversary, Pakistan, resulting in",
  "whatisnowwidelyconsideredan\u2018all-weather\u2019friendship.ChinasupportedPakistaninits1965",
  "and 1971 wars against India and helped in the development of its nuclear weapons arsenal.",
  "Meanwhile, the Indian nuclear weapons programme was accelerated in light of China\u2019s testing",
  "of nuclear weapons in 1964.",
  "The border issue continues to be a major obstacle in Sino-Indian ties, with minor skirmishes",
  "at the border continuing since 1962. As China and the USA came closer after their rap-",
  "prochement in 1972, India gravitated to the USSR to balance the Sino-US-Pakistani axis. It",
  "wasin1988thatthethenIndianPrimeMinister,RajivGandhi,turnedoveranewleafinSino-",
  "Indian ties, when he went to Beijing and signed an agreement that aimed to achieve a \u2018fair and",
  "reasonable settlement while seeking a mutually acceptable solution to the border dispute\u2019.4 The",
  "visit saw a Joint Working Group (JWG) set up to explore the boundary issue and examine",
  "probable solutions to the problem.",
  "However, bilateral relations between India and China touched their nadir in the immediate",
  "aftermath ofIndia\u2019s nucleartests in May1998. China hadbeen singledout as the \u2018numberone\u2019",
  "security threat for India by India\u2019s defence minister just before the nuclear tests.5 After the tests",
  "theIndianPrimeMinisterwrotetotheUSPresidentjustifyingIndiannucleartestsasaresponse",
  "to the threat posed by China:",
  "We have an overt nuclear weapon state [China] on our borders, a state which committed",
  "armed aggression against India in 1962. Although our relations with that country have",
  "improved in the last decade or so, an atmosphere of distrust persists mainly due to the",
  "unresolved border problem. To add to the distrust that country has materially helped",
  "another neighbour of ours [Pakistan] to become a covert nuclear weapons state.6",
  "Not surprisingly, China reacted strongly, with diplomatic relations between the two countries",
  "plummeting to an all-time low.",
  "However, after more than a decade, relations between the two countries, at least super-",
  "\ufb01cially, seem to be on a much \ufb01rmer footing, as they have tried to reduce the prospect for",
  "rivalry and expand areas of co-operation. The visit of the Indian Minister of External A\ufb00airs to",

  "China in 1999 marked the resumption of high-level dialogue, as the two sides declared that",
  "they were not a threat to each other. A bilateral security dialogue was also initiated, which has",
  "helped the two countries to openly express and share their security concerns with each other.",
  "Both China and India continue to emphasize that neither side should let di\ufb00erences act as an",
  "impediment to the growth of functional co-operation elsewhere between the two states. India",
  "and China also decided to expedite the process of demarcation of the Line of Actual Control",
  "(LAC),and the JWGonthe boundary question,set upin 1988, has beenmeetingregularly. As",
  "a \ufb01rst step in this direction the two countries exchanged border maps on the least controversial",
  "Middle Sector of the LAC. More recently, both nations agreed Political Parameters and Guid-",
  "ing Principles for the Settlement of the India-China Boundary Question (2005), broad princi-",

  "India-China JWG. India and China also decided to hold their \ufb01rst joint naval and air exercises.",
  "More signi\ufb01cantly, India acknowledged China\u2019s sovereignty over Tibet and pledged not to",
  "allow \u2018anti-China\u2019 political activities in India. For its part, China seemed to have \ufb01nally",
  "acknowledged India\u2019s 1975 incorporation of the former monarchy of Sikkim, by agreeing to",
  "openatradingpostalongtheborderwiththeformerkingdomandlaterbyrectifyingitso\ufb03cial",
  "maps to include Sikkim as part of India.9 After being closed for 60 years, the Nathu La pass, a",
  "traditional trading post between Tibet and Sikkim, was reopened in 2006. High-level political",
  "interactions have continued unabated since then. The two states have set up institutionalized",
  "defence consultation mechanisms to reduce suspicion and indentify areas of co-operation on",
  "security issues.",
  "Soon after assuming o\ufb03ce, the Manmohan Singh Government made it clear that it was for",
  "closer ties with China and would continue to work towards improving bilateral relations with",
  "the country. India\u2019s former national security adviser, J.N. Dixit, wrote that \u2018the Congress will",
  "continue the process of normalizing, strengthening and expanding India\u2019s relations with China,",
  "which is the most important factor a\ufb00ecting Asian security and stability\u2019.10 In his \ufb01rst address to",
  "the nation, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh also emphasized the carrying forward of the",
  "process of further development and diversi\ufb01cation of Sino-Indian relations.11",
  "When Singh visited China in 2008, the two states signed a Shared Visions on the 21st",

  "and Prosperity between the two countries\u2019.12 Support for the earlier Agreement on Political",

  "The global structural imperative",
  "At this international system level, India and China have found some real convergence of inter-",
  "ests. Both share similar concerns about the international dominance of the USA, the threat of",
  "fundamentalistreligiousandethnicmovementsintheformofterrorism,andtheneedtoaccord",
  "primacy to economic development. India and China have both expressed concern about the",
  "USA\u2019s use of military power around the world, and both were publicly opposed to the war in",
  "Iraq. This was merely a continuation of the desire of both states to oppose US hyper puissance",
  "ever since the end of the Cold War.",
  "Both China and India, much like other major powers in the international system, favour a",
  "multipolar world order wherein US unipolarity remains constrained by the other \u2018poles\u2019 in the",
  "system. China and India zealously guard their national sovereignty and have been wary of US",
  "attempts to interfere in what they see as domestic a\ufb00airs of other states, be it Serbia, Kosovo or",
  "Iraq.BothtookstrongexceptiontotheUSairstrikesonIraqin1998,theUS-ledaircampaign",
  "against Yugoslavia in 1999, and more recently the US campaign against Saddam Hussain; both",
  "India and China argued that these violated the sovereignty of both countries and undermined",
  "the authority of the UN system. China and India share an interest in resisting interventionist",
  "foreign policy doctrines emanating from the West, particularly the USA, and display con-",
  "servative attitudes on the prerogatives of sovereignty.",
  "China and India have co-ordinated their e\ufb00orts on issues as wide ranging as climate change,",
  "trade negotiations, energy security and the global \ufb01nancial crisis. Both nations favour more",
  "democratic international economic regimes. It is being argued that the forces of globalization",
  "have led to a certain convergence of Sino-Indian interests in the economic realm, as the two",
  "nations become even more deeply engaged in the international trading economy and more",
  "integrated in global \ufb01nancial networks.14 They have strongly resisted e\ufb00orts by the USA and",
  "other developed nations to link global trade to labour and environmental standards, realizing",
  "clearly that this would put them at a huge disadvantage vis-\u00e0-vis the developed world, thereby",
  "hampering their drive towards economic development, the number one priority for both",
  "countries.BothhavecommittedthemselvestocraftingjointSino-IndianpositionsintheWorld",
  "Trade Organization (WTO) and global trade negotiations in the hope that this might provide",
  "them with greater negotiating leverage over other developed states. They would like to see",
  "further liberalization of agricultural trade in the developed countries, to tighten the rules on",
  "anti-dumping measures and ensure that non-trade-related issues such as labour and the envir-",
  "onment are not allowed to come into the WTO. Both have fought carbon emission caps pro-",
  "posed by the industrialized world and have resisted Western pressure to open up their",
  "agricultural markets.",
  "The attempt by India and China in recent years has been to build their bilateral relationship",
  "on the basis of their larger world view of international politics. As they have found a distinct",
  "convergence of their interests on the world stage, they have used it to strengthen their bilateral",
  "relations. They have established and maintained regular reciprocal high-level visits between",
  "political leaders. There has been a sincere attempt to improve trade relations and to compart-",
  "mentalizeintractable issuesthatmake itdi\ufb03cultfor theirbilateralrelationship to moveforward.",
  "India and China have strengthened their bilateral relationship in areas as distinct as cultural",
  "andeducationalexchanges,militaryexchanges,andscienceandtechnologyco-operation.Some",
  "military co-operation, something unthinkable a few years back, now takes place, with Indian",
  "and Chinese militaries conducting joint exercises. Economic relations between the two have",
  "been burgeoning, with China now India\u2019s largest trading partner. It was former Chinese Pre-",

  "accelerate, with India-China bilateral trade reaching $32,000m. in the \ufb01rst half of 2010. In",
  "addition to trade and interaction in the information technology sector, India facilitates China\u2019s",
  "economic development by exporting raw materials and semi-\ufb01nished goods, as well as shipping",
  "Chinese cargo oversees. Chinese companies, for their part, have just begun to tap into India\u2019s",
  "ever-expanding consumer market by exporting electrical machines, home appliances, consumer",
  "electronics and mechanical goods. The two nations are also evaluating the possibility of signing",
  "a Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement and a Free Trade Agreement, thereby",
  "building on strong complementarities between the two economies.",
  "The number one priority for China\u2019s leadership today is economic growth and social stabi-",
  "lity. China\u2019s focus is going to be on maintaining its high rates of economic growth in coming",
  "years. Hu Jintao is a product of the \u2018evolutionary policies\u2019 of Deng Xiaoping, which emphasize",
  "economic growth and orderly governance. China can be expected to continue on its current",

  "development at present, though its democratic political institutional structure ensures that con-",
  "sensus will elude India on the desirable route to economic development and modernization.",
  "Global co-ordination and bilateral tensions",
  "At the global level, the rhetoric is all about co-operation and, indeed, the two sides have",
  "worked together on climate change, global trade negotiations and in demanding a restructuring",
  "of global \ufb01nancial institutions in view of the global economy\u2019s shifting centre of gravity.",
  "At the bilateral level, however, things reached a level in 2009 such that China took its ter-",
  "ritorial dispute with India all the way to the Asian Development Bank, where it blocked an",
  "application by India for a loan that included development projects in the Indian state of Aru-",
  "nachal Pradesh, which China continues to claim as part of its own territory. Buoyed by the",
  "perception that the Administration of US President Barack Obama plans to make its ties with",
  "China the centrepiece of its foreign policy in light of growing US economic dependence on",
  "China, China has displayed a distinctly more aggressive stance vis-\u00e0-vis India. China\u2019s lack of",
  "support for the US-Indian civilian nuclear energy co-operation pact, which it tried to block at",
  "the Nuclear Suppliers Group, and its obstructionist stance to bringing those behind the",
  "November 2009 terrorist attack in Mumbai to justice have further strained ties.15",
  "Sino-Indian frictions are growing and potential for con\ufb02ict remains high. There is rising",
  "alarm in India because of frequent and strident claims being made by China along the LAC in",
  "Arunachal Pradesh and Sikkim. Indians have complained that there has been a dramatic rise in",
  "Chinese cross-border \u2018intrusions\u2019 into the Indian territory over the last two years, most of them",
  "along the border in the region of Arunachal Pradesh, the Indian state that China refers to as",
  "Zangnan \u2018Southern Tibet\u2019. China has upped the ante on the border issue. It protested against",
  "the Indian Prime Minister\u2019s visit to Arunachal Pradesh in 2009, asserting its claims over the",
  "territory. WhathascaughtmostobserversofSino-Indian tiesbysurpriseisthevehemence with",

  "how to address the boundary dispute. Even the rhetoric has degenerated to the extent that a",
  "Chinese analyst connected to China\u2019s Ministry of National Defence claimed in a 2009 article",
  "that China could \u2018dismember the so-called \u201cIndian Union\u201d with one little move\u2019 into as many",
  "as 30 fragments.16",
  "The fundamental underpinnings of the Sino-Indian bilateral relationship remain highly",
  "uncertain. China has tried hard to maintain a rough \u2018balance of power\u2019 in South Asia by pre-",
  "venting India from gaining an upper hand over Pakistan. China has consistently assisted Paki-",
  "stan\u2019s nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programmes to counterbalance India\u2019s development",
  "of new weapons systems. India\u2019s preoccupation with Pakistan reduces India to the level of a",
  "regional power, while China can claim the status of an Asian and world power. It is instructive",
  "to note that even as India and China share similar concerns regarding Islamist terrorism in",
  "Kashmir and Xinjiang, respectively, China has been rather unwilling to make a common cause",

  "spending is at least double the announced \ufb01gure. The o\ufb03cial \ufb01gures of the Chinese Govern-",
  "ment do not include the cost of new weapon purchases, research or other big-ticket items for",
  "China\u2019s highly secretive military and, as a result, the real \ufb01gure may be much higher than the",
  "revealed amount. Whatever Chinese intentions might be, consistent increases in defence bud-",
  "gets over the last several years have put China on track to become a major military power and",
  "the power most capable of challenging US predominance in the Asia-Paci\ufb01c. While China\u2019s",
  "near-term focus remains on preparations for potential problems in the Taiwan Strait, its nuclear",
  "force modernization, its growing arsenal of advanced missiles, and its development of space and",
  "cyberspace technologies are changing the military balance in Asia and beyond. As China",
  "becomes more reliant on imported oil for its rapidly growing industrial economy, it will",
  "develop and exercise military power projection capabilities to protect the shipping that trans-",

  "Conversely, reports of Chinese intrusion across the Sino-Indian border appear time and",
  "again, especially across the eastern sector of the LAC in Arunachal Pradesh, with China con-",
  "tinuing to lay claim to 90,000 sq miles of land in Arunachal Pradesh and not recognizing Aru-",
  "nachal Pradesh as part of Indian territory.20 The opening up of the Nathu La trade route that",
  "connects Tibet and Sikkim was also fraught with dangers, because there were concerns that",
  "threats to the internal security of India posed by China could get worse with this opening.",
  "Moreover, the hopes of high trade \ufb02ows through Nathu La have proved to be meagre trickles",
  "instead. India-China tradeis overwhelmingly conducted via the sea,andis tradein which there",
  "has been a growing disadvantage for India in the past decade. A trade de\ufb01cit for India with",
  "China of just over $4,100m. in 2005/06 had become a trade de\ufb01cit of just over $19,200m. in",

  "Meanwhile,eventhoughChinahassolvedmostofitsborderdisputeswithothercountries,it",

  "forthcoming from the Sino-Indian border negotiations even as the talks continue endlessly and",

  "planning. The defeat at the hands of the Chinese in 1962 has psychologically scarred the elite",
  "perceptions of China and they are unlikely to change in the near future. China is viewed by",
  "India as a growing, aggressive nationalistic power, the ambitions of which are likely to reshape",
  "the contours of regional and global balance of power with deleterious consequences for Indian",
  "interests.21 Whilst Indian policy-makers continue to believe that Beijing is not a short-term",
  "threat to India, they believe it needs to be watched over the long term, with Indian defence",
  "o\ufb03cials increasingly warning in rather blunt terms about the disparity between the two Asian",
  "powers. India has been warned by its former Naval Chief that the country neither has \u2018the",
  "capability nor the intention to match China force for force\u2019 in military terms, while the former",
  "Air Chief has suggested that China posed more of a threat to India than Pakistan.22",

  "matic and military overtures, setting the stage for Sino-Indian strategic rivalry.",
  "The rise of China is a major factor in the evolution of Indo-Japanese ties, as is the USA\u2019s",
  "attempt to build India into a major balancer in the region. Both India and Japan are well aware",
  "of China\u2019s not so subtle attempts at preventing their rise. It is most clearly re\ufb02ected in China\u2019s",
  "opposition to the expansion of the UN Security Council to include India and Japan as perma-",

  "weapon state is something that it would be loathe to share with any other state in Asia. India\u2019s",
  "\u2018Look East\u2019 policy of active engagement with ASEAN and East Asia remains largely predicated",
  "upon Japanese support, whilst generating Chinese ambivalence. India\u2019s participation in the East",
  "Asia Summit was facilitated by Japan, but initially resisted by China. While China has resisted",
  "the inclusion of India, Australia and New Zealand in ASEAN, Japan has strongly backed the",

  "Conclusions",
  "Both China and India are rising at the same time in an Asia-Paci\ufb01c strategic landscape that is in",
  "\ufb02ux. India is still \u2018grappling with an uneasy relationship\u2019 vis-\u00e0-vis China, amidst their simulta-",
  "neous ascent in the global inter-state hierarchy and in mostly the same region of the world.25",
  "Evenastheysigndocumentswithhigh-soundingwordsyearafteryear,thedistrustbetweenthe",
  "two is actually growing at an alarming rate. Economic co-operation and bilateral political as",
  "well as socio-cultural exchanges are at an all-time high, yet this has done little to assuage their",
  "concerns vis-\u00e0-vis each other\u2019s intentions. Despite the rhetoric of a new phase in the relation-",
  "ship, the problems between India and China are substantial and complicated, with no easy",
  "resolution in sight. India and China are two major powers in Asia with global aspirations and",
  "some signi\ufb01cant con\ufb02icting interests. The geopolitical reality of Asia ensures that it will be",
  "extremely di\ufb03cult, if not impossible, for Hind-China (\u2018Indians and Chinese\u2019) to be bhai-bhai",
  "(brothers) in the foreseeable future.",
