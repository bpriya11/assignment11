  "country\u2019s dependency ratio (proportion of non-working to working people) is likely to fall",
  "further, triggering a virtuous cycle of even higher domestic savings, capital accumulation and",
  "investment. With an ageing population, China\u2019s economic growth is predicted to slow down",
  "by 2020, while India \u2018will be the locomotive of the future [\u2026] until the middle of this",
  "century\u2019.29",
  "Yet, it is clear that simply enjoying a preponderance of young, productive workers in the",
  "labour force does not automatically generate positives unless India goes into public policy",

  "and technical spheres have been described as an ugly \u2018underbelly of India\u2019s demographic divi-",

  "stands to gain impressively if various government- and industry-proposed reforms to give edu-",
  "cation a practical tinge are e\ufb00ectively implemented.",
  "The other big lacuna that holds India\u2019s economy back is the substandard condition of its",
  "infrastructure, which raises the costs of economic transactions, and lowers e\ufb03ciency and prof-",
  "itability. India\u2019s roads, bridges, airports, seaports, electricity grids and clean water utilities are",

  "depleting coal resources and limited hydro-electric power potential. The much-touted India-",

  "away after its greatest exponent, the country\u2019s \ufb01rst Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru, died in",
  "1964. In the Nehru years, India was a pygmy in hard power indices, but a giant in soft power, in",
