  "Introduction",
  "The al-Qa\u2019ida attack on the USA on 11 September 2001 heralded a decade in which Indian",
  "concerns with terrorism were highlighted at the international level. Analysts argued that al-",
  "Qa\u2019ida and its linkages with the Taliban meant that \u2018the headquarters of international terrorism",
  "has moved from West Asia to the Subcontinent\u2019.1 The Indian discourse on international ter-",
  "rorism is clearly re\ufb02ective of its concerns with cross-border terrorism perpetrated by terrorist",
  "groups based in Pakistan with connections to al-Qa\u2019ida. More recently, the appearance of sup-",
  "port groups based in Nepal, Bangladesh, Bhutan and Sri Lanka has resulted in the spread of",
  "terrorism from speci\ufb01c geographic locales to urban centres in India.2",
  "Indian security analysts expressed their alarm at the \ufb01rst reference to Kashmir by Osama bin",
  "Laden, in an audio message on Al Jazeera on 23 April 2006, when he spoke of a \u2018Crusader-",
  "Zionist-Hindu\u2019 conspiracy.3 Such analysts asserted that jihadist organizations a\ufb03liated to the",
  "International IslamicFront(IIF)hadbeenactive inJammuandKashmir since1993.Since 1998",
  "al-Qa\u2019ida\u2019s imprint was felt in India in the form of jihadist suicide terrorism in Jammu and",
  "Kashmir. Al-Qa\u2019ida\u2019s modus operandi in terms of use of improvised explosive devices (IEDs),",
  "\ufb01dayeen suicide attacks, self-fabricated explosives, use of the internet (for communication, pro-",
  "paganda and other operational purposes), and use of mobile phones as trigger devices, all",
  "became visible in India. Also the selection of soft targets, civilians, economic and strategic",
  "infrastructure, was seen as being akin to the al-Qa\u2019ida mode of operation.",
  "As a region that has experienced terrorism for several decades, various scholars and security",
  "analystshaveanalysedthenatureofterrorisminIndiaandSouthAsia.AccordingtoS.D.Muni,",
  "there are four distinct characteristics of terrorism in South Asia. First is the terrorism-con\ufb02ict",
  "link. Con\ufb02icts rooted in political marginalization, socio-economic deprivation, discrimination,",
  "caste, religious, regional and cultural suppression, and neglect cause terrorism.4 Second is the",
  "politics-terror nexus, witnessed in Pakistani (especially Inter-Services Intelligence\u2014ISI) support",
  "to terrorist groups that work against India, or Sri Lankan President Ranasinghe Premadasa\u2019s",
  "covert support of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) against the Indian Peace-",
  "keeping Force in Sri Lanka. Third is the use of force by groups and the state use of force to",
  "counter terrorism. Finally, there is the external dimension of terrorism, characterized by",

  "bilateral and multilateral co-operation, and third-party mediation by donor countries between",
  "governments and the terrorist organization.5 According to Ayesha Siddiqa, there are two types",
  "of terrorism in South Asia: \ufb01rst, terrorism induced and conducted in partnership with global",
  "terrorist networks; and second, acts of violence in pursuance of the rights of people.6 Among",
  "the \ufb01rst category are included terrorist groups in Pakistan and Bangladesh with links to al-",
  "Qa\u2019ida.ThesegroupsalsosupporttheISI-sponsoredreligiouswarinJammuandKashmir.7The",
  "second category contains certain groups in India, Nepal and Sri Lanka. In such analyses, the",
  "international connection is conspicuous.",
  "WithinIndia,theexternalconnections ofterrorist groups activein JammuandKashmirhave",
  "been highlighted often. Scholars have argued that Pakistan and Afghanistan have had a tre-",
  "mendous in\ufb02uence on the Islamist transformation of the insurgency in Kashmir.8 Quoting the",
  "1993reportoftheUSHouseofRepresentativesResearchCommitteeentitledTheNewIslamist",
  "International, K. Warikoo argues that in addition to providing logistical support, Pakistan\u2019s ISI",
  "runs organizations like Hizb-e-Islami, Harkat-ul-Jihad and Jamaat-i-Islami (in Pakistan), Hizb-e-",
  "Islami and Jamiat-i-Islami (Afghanistan), and Hizbul Mujahideen (Kashmir). All these had become",
  "part of the Popular International Organization (PIO) led by Hassan al-Turabi. At the peak of",
  "militancy in Kashmir, several organizations had a clearly Islamist agenda, including the Islami-",
  "zation of the province\u2019s socio-political and economic set-up, a merger with Pakistan, and uni-",
  "\ufb01cation of the \u2018ummah [Muslim world] community\u2019. Two organizations, Tehrik-i-Ahyay-e-",
  "Khilafat and Tehrik-e-Khilafat-e-Islamia that were in existence in 1992 even advocated the estab-",
  "lishment of an Islamic Caliphate. In the north-eastern states of India, where terrorism is char-",
  "acterized by tribal groups acting against the state, one tribal group acting against another tribal",
  "group, and tribal groups acting against non-tribal groups, the external linkages impact through",
  "criminal networks, illegal migration of Bangladeshis, and Islamist militancy.9 Using data from",
  "the University of Maryland\u2019s Global Terrorism Database II for the period 1998\u20132004, it has been",
  "argued that the fatalities caused by terrorist attacks are linked to the attack type and attack",
  "group. In this period India su\ufb00ered the highest number of terrorist incidents (784 out of 7,184",
  "world-wide), and fatalities (3,008). Bombings, followed by armed assaults, have resulted in the",
  "most casualties. Among the known perpetrators, Islamist groups have caused the most fatalities,",
  "most of them in Jammu and Kashmir, followed by fatalities in the north-east.10",
  "The external connection is also emphasized by police o\ufb03cials who have been involved in",
  "controlling the drugs menace in the region. In their study on the working of the Golden Tri-",
  "angle and the Golden Crescent in India, they dwell at length on the negative forces unleashed",
  "byglobalization,whichhave hadatremendousimpact.11ThelongseabordersofIndiaandthe",

  "the terrorist threat in India.12",
  "The transnational nature of terrorism in the region has had an impact on inter-state relations",
  "in South Asia. State sponsorship of terrorism and the victim state\u2019s response has increased bilat-",
  "eral tensions between India and her neighbours, namely Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Nepal",
  "and Bhutan. It has also been instrumental in increasing the role of the USA as a regional",
  "player.13 S.D. Muni \ufb01rmly concludes that narco-terrorism, money-laundering, illegal small",
  "arms, state support to non-state groups and migrants are all instances of \u2018subaltern globalization\u2019",
  "that are a menace to the state, inter-state relations and the subalterns in South Asia.14",

  "is now a front-runner in the war against terrorism\u2019.16 Given its long-term collaboration with",
  "Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Iran, strategic thinkers also saw an opportunity for India to play a",
  "crucial role in Afghanistan in safeguarding the interests of the Uzbek, Tajik and Hazara (Shi\u2019a)",
  "minorities.17",
  "Pragmatists, however, cautioned against an over-zealous response to the international cam-",
  "paign on the basis of an acceptance of Indian concerns. They argued that the necessities of",
  "geopolitics made Pakistan critically important for the USA. India, therefore, would never be",
  "able to ensure that the USA named Pakistan as a \u2018state sponsor of terrorism\u2019. In these circum-",
  "stances, it would be best for India to put together an alternative alliance of countries that shares",
  "its priorities, such as Russia, Sri Lanka and Israel.18 By 2002, the mismatch between Indian and",
  "US perspectives on terrorism was being debated openly in India.19",
  "Some argued that given the distinct Indian ethos, India should not compete with Pakistan to",

  "They also noted with satisfaction the continuing co-operation and exchange of information",
  "between narcotics-control agencies of both countries and agreed to put in place an under-",
  "standing between them. Their Memorandum of Understanding aimed to have a regular insti-",
  "tutional mechanism in place to intensify mutual co-operation and liaison on drugs-control",
  "matters. In addition to these areas, in the third round of meetings they agreed on the need to",
  "take measures to check human-tra\ufb03cking, illegal immigration and counterfeit currency.",
  "At the meeting between the Indian and Pakistani leaders on 16 September 2006 in Havana,",
  "Cuba, both leaders decided to put in place a Joint Anti-Terrorism Mechanism, to identify and",

  "tigations on either side related to terrorist acts and prevention of violence and terrorist acts in",

  "Secretary (International Organizations) of the Ministry of External A\ufb00airs of India and the",
  "Additional Secretary (UN and European Commission) of the Ministry of Foreign A\ufb00airs of",
  "Pakistan. Its mandate was to consider counter-terrorism measures, including the regular and",

  "It is interesting to note that the breakthrough in bilateral co-operation with Pakistan came at",
  "the end of the near failure of the regional initiatives of SAARC, through which India tried to",
  "get the co-operation of its neighbouring countries in preventing cross-border terrorism. India is",
  "party to the SAARC Convention on Suppression of Terrorism, which came into force in",
  "August 1988. The SAARC Convention de\ufb01ned acts of terrorism that would not qualify as",
  "political o\ufb00ences. It also gave extra-territorial jurisdiction to nations to punish perpetrators of",
  "terrorist acts and made it obligatory for member countries to adopt domestic legislation that",
  "criminalizes terrorism. Such laws were enacted by India, Sri Lanka, Nepal and Bhutan, but not",
  "by Pakistan. In 1993 India also enacted the SAARC Convention (Suppression of Terrorism)",
  "Act, to give e\ufb00ect to the Convention and as part of India\u2019s \ufb01ght against \u2018the menace of global",
  "terrorism\u2019.38 The Government took up the issue of misuse of territories of neighbouring",

  "list, the Specially Designated Global Terrorists (SDGT) list and the Terrorist Exclusion List",
  "(TEL) In addition, it called upon Pakistan to take steps to crack down on terrorism emanating",
  "from Pakistan and to take decisive action against the LeT and JeM and other terrorist organi-",
  "zations, their leaders, \ufb01nances and activities. The White House notice issued on the same day",
  "described the LeT as the armed wing of the Pakistan-based religious organization, Markaz-ud-",
  "Dawa-wal-Irshad.",
  "Alan Kronstadt\u2019s Congressional Research Study of 2003 clearly stated that terrorism in",
  "Kashmir was supported by groups like LeT and others that are based in Pakistan, and which",
  "have been o\ufb03cially designated by the US as \u2018foreign terrorist organizations\u2019. In addition, this",
  "Congressional Research Study also declared the Al-Akhtar Trust in Pakistan to be a terrorist",

  "a global terrorist.42 The 2003 Patterns of Global Terrorism Report recognized that the extre-",
  "mist violence in Jammu and Kashmir was fuelled by in\ufb01ltration across the Line of Control.",
  "Besides retaining the designation of Pakistan-based groups such as LeT, Harkat-ul Mujahideen",
  "and JeM as terrorist organizations, the USA has, in the 2003 Report, added others, such as al-",
  "Badr Mujahideen, Hizb-ul Mujahideen and Jamiat ul-Mujahideen, to its lists of terrorist organiza-",

  "Conclusions",
  "Although India had been facing the threat of international terrorism for several decades, her",
  "concerns were taken seriously only in the aftermath of the 11 September 2001 attacks on the",
  "USA. This was re\ufb02ected in increasing international support for the Indian draft Comprehensive",
  "Convention on International Terrorism at the UN. In the years that followed, India took the",
  "lead in formulating and sponsoring several important conventions and declarations on various",
  "aspects of international terrorism. In compliance with the resolutions of the Counter Terrorism",
  "Committee, India\u2019s internal mechanisms for dealing with the terrorism (legal, institutional and",
  "operational) challenge were strengthened. Despite India\u2019s diplomatic initiatives, however, the",
  "consequences of state sponsorship of terrorism are yet to be appreciated fully by the interna-",
  "tional community.",
