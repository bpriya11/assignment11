  "Introduction",
  "Since a low point in 1990 when the Indian Peace-Keeping Forces (IPKF) withdrew from Sri",
  "Lanka, the relationship between India and Sri Lanka has undergone a period of signi\ufb01cant",
  "recuperation. In the late 1980s and early 1990s the bilateral relationship su\ufb00ered from bitterness",
  "and mistrust on both sides. Today the relationship is much healthier, and the two countries",
  "maintain close economic and defence co-operation. How did this positive transformation in",
  "their relationship occur, and what challenges and issues constrain the development of an even",
  "stronger bilateral relationship?",
  "India\u2019seconomic-ledforeignpolicy,exempli\ufb01edintheManmohanDoctrine,foundawayto",
  "foster a close relationship with its neighbour. India emphasized economic relations and backed",
  "away from the highly contentious political issues of con\ufb02ict intervention. Since the India-Sri",
  "Lanka Free Trade Agreement (ISLFTA) became operational in 2000, increased trade and",
  "investment have been the impetus for the improvement in bilateral relations.",

  "in the trade balance, which had been heavily lopsided toward India, helped diminish the Sri",
  "Lankan perception of India as the region\u2019s hegemonic bully. Burgeoning trade and investment",
  "between India and Sri Lanka, including in the strategic energy sector, have woven economic",
  "inter-dependency into the bilateral relationship. This helped India and Sri Lanka push past the",
  "mistrust and resentment that had characterized the deterioration in their relationship during the",
  "late 1980s and early 1990s.",

  "tening to undermine India\u2019s own security and internal stability. Thus, today, Sri Lanka\u2019s unity,",
  "peace and stability are India\u2019s primary concern. Additionally, maritime security in the Indian",
  "Ocean and between India and Sri Lanka has developed into a prominent concern for Indian",
  "policy-makers. Sri Lanka is located at an important point for projecting naval power into the",
  "Indian Ocean, and is an enviable berth for major naval powers with interests in the region.",
  "Within this, the in\ufb02uence of the People\u2019s Republic of China and Pakistan in Sri Lanka is also",
  "worrisome for India\u2019s security interests.",

  "Under the ISLA, Sri Lanka had to scrap the American contract for the Trincomalee oil storage",

  "re\ufb02ected the Indian policy-makers\u2019 aim to push the USA\u2019s Cold War meddling a safe distance",

  "relations became highly developed and close. Instead of US encroachment, it has been negative",
  "externalities of the con\ufb02ict that have irritated the relationship since the end of the Cold War.",
  "Sri Lanka\u2019s ethnic violence increased maritime security concerns in the Palk Strait and adja-",
  "cent water. India has a large economic stake in a secure and manoeuvrable Indian Ocean",
  "environment, and Sri Lanka plays a signi\ufb01cant role in this. Sri Lanka occupies a critical location",
  "in the Indian Ocean\u2019s strategic environment, as international shipping lanes \ufb02ow right by Sri",
  "Lanka\u2019s southern coast. The port of Colombo is used as an entry and exit point for regional",
  "goods, bound for or incoming from the East and the West. The Indian Ocean accommodates",
  "half the world\u2019s containerized freight, one-third of its bulk cargo, and two-thirds of its oil",
  "shipments.2 Thus its security is an essential consideration for all economies with signi\ufb01cant sea-",
  "based trade and energy demands.",

  "maritime trade: over 70% of Indian imports arrive through the port of Colombo for bulk-",
  "breaking before they are shipped on local vessels to Indian ports. In the post-Cold War period,",
  "and especially since India passed trade-oriented economic reforms in 1991, India\u2019s dependence",
  "on the Indian Ocean as a maritime trading zone and transit-way for oil trade has meant that",

  "securing the Indian Ocean is crucial to its continued engagement with the international mar-",
  "ketplace. The waters adjacent to Sri Lanka assume special signi\ufb01cance in these security",
  "arrangements.",
  "Sri Lanka\u2019s strategic importance as a maritime power base in the Indian Ocean has historical",
  "roots. Sri Lanka\u2019s colonizers\u2014the Portuguese, the Dutch and the British\u2014recognized Sri",
  "Lanka\u2019s value as a trading port and naval base. The British occupied the island, then called",
  "Ceylon, not only for strategic maritime purposes (as the Portuguese and Dutch had done), but",
  "also for the protection of neighbouring British India. After independence India continued to",
  "recognize and treat Sri Lanka as strategically important in the regional maritime environment.",
  "With strong motivations for major powers to gain economic and military access on the",
  "island, Sri Lanka \ufb01nds itself vulnerable to major power penetration. In the 1980s the USA",
  "gained a listening post into the USSR from the island, irking Indian policy-makers. Since then,",
  "China\u2019s and Pakistan\u2019s engagement with Sri Lanka\u2019s defence and economic activity has worried",
  "Indian policy-makers. Foreign power penetration in Sri Lanka is inimical to Indian interests.",
  "The 1980s: India meddles and then intervenes in Sri Lankan con\ufb02ict",
  "In July 1983 an attack by the nascent Tamil militant group, the Liberation Tigers of Tamil",
  "Eelam (LTTE), provoked a violent backlash against Sri Lankan Tamils by the Sinhalese-domi-",
  "nated Sri Lankan state. Sombrely referred to as \u2018Black July\u2019, these events marked the beginning",
  "of full-scale ethnic con\ufb02ict that would vitiate the next 25 years of Sri Lankan history. The",
  "con\ufb02ict would also put a damper on relations with Sri Lanka\u2019s closest neighbour and regional",
  "power\u2014India.",
  "Two major in\ufb02uences pushed India\u2019s policy response to the Sri Lankan con\ufb02ict: the active",
  "engagement of foreign in\ufb02uence by the Sri Lankan Government and the demands of India\u2019s",

  "India in the region by facilitating the strategic presence of the forces inimical to India\u2019s per-",
  "ceived security interests\u2019.3",
  "Also of concern to India was the backlash among kin Tamils in Tamil Nadu. India\u2019s Tamil",

  "asserted its in\ufb02uence on the situation as a regional power, kin state, and close neighbour.",
  "Mrs Gandhi\u2019s policy featured a multi-pronged approach. She persuaded the Sri Lankan Pre-",
  "sident Jayewardene to open negotiations with Tamil groups,4 and India facilitated direct talks",

  "beckoned Jayewardene to dialogue with the Tamils, however, Indian government o\ufb03cials",
  "voiced strong concerns and sympathy for the su\ufb00erings of the Sri Lankan Tamils. For the Sri",
  "Lankan Sinhalese population, India\u2019s rhetorical support for the Tamils biased India\u2019s support for",
  "a negotiated settlement. By focusing attention in Western capitals on the Sri Lankan military\u2019s",
  "aggression towards the Tamils, India further forti\ufb01ed the Sinhalese perception that India was",
  "prejudiced against the Sri Lankan state.5 It was also during this time that India\u2019s external intel-",

  "resistance against the Sri Lankan state.",
  "WhenRajivGandhisucceededhisassassinatedmotherasPrimeMinister,hechangedtackon",
  "his mother\u2019s Sri Lanka policy. Rajiv drew closer to the Sri Lankan state and toughened India\u2019s",
  "position on the LTTE. He reversed his predecessor\u2019s policy on negotiations by adopting the Sri",
  "LankanGovernment\u2019spositiontoholdnegotiationsonlyafter,asopposedtobefore,cessationof",
  "violence. At this time as well, India, in co-operation with the Sri Lankan Navy, started patrol-",
  "ling the Palk Straits in earnest, to counter Tamil militant groups which were transporting sup-",
  "plies and rebels between the southern coast of India and northern Sri Lanka. The policy shift,",
  "under Rajiv, pushed for a resolution of the con\ufb02ict at the costof alienating the Tamilmilitants.",
  "Rajiv\u2019s policy failed to end the con\ufb02ict or resolve the ethnic issue. By the end of 1985 the",
  "Tamil militants had established international connections and received supplies and sanctuary in",
  "Tamil Nadu now without Indian intelligence covert support. To make matters worse,",
  "Colombo was showing no proclivity toward granting basic regional autonomy and devolution",
  "of powers to the Tamil community. After failed peace talks between the Sri Lankan Govern-",
  "ment and Tamil leaders in the Bhutanese capital, Thimphu in 1985, the Sri Lankan Govern-",
  "ment resumed its military solution against the Tamil insurgency. By 1987 the Tamils on the",
  "Ja\ufb00na Peninsula faced a humanitarian crisis caused by the Sri Lankan o\ufb00ensive, pushing India to",
  "intervene. After sending relief supplies by boat, which Sri Lanka turned away, India launched",
  "Operation Poomalai dropping \u2018bread bombs\u2019 (relief packages) on the Peninsula from Indian Air",
  "Force planes. Critics complained that India had impinged on Sri Lanka\u2019s sovereignty, but India",
  "wasunapologeticsinceitheldthatitsinterventionhadhelpedlimitTamilsu\ufb00eringatthehands",
  "of the Sri Lankan Government. Sri Lanka\u2019s military o\ufb00ensive had challenged India\u2019s tolerance",
  "for state violence against the Tamil population, and India responded with a more active policy.",
  "Operation Poomalai served as the launching pad for deeper and formalized Indian interven-",
  "tion in Sri Lanka. In June 1987 Sri Lanka\u2019s Minister of External A\ufb00airs stated that by involving",
  "itselfthroughtheuseof\u2018breadbombs\u2019,Indianowhada\u2018moralobligation\u2019toresolvetheethnic",
  "dispute. The Minister\u2019s statement, while beckoning India\u2019s further involvement, also indicated",
  "India\u2019s loss of credibilityas a mediator onthe ethnic issue, as it made clear India\u2019s bias in favour",
  "of the Tamilcause.6 Its humanitarian intervention did, in fact, signal India\u2019s openness to greater",
  "intervention,promptingSriLanka,thenunderPresidentJ.R.Jayewardene,toinitiatetalkswith",
  "Rajiv Gandhi, resulting in the signing of the ISLA on 29 July 1987.",
  "The ISLA was signed between India and Sri Lanka with only a dubious \u2018go-ahead\u2019 from the",
  "LTTE. When the ISLA was implemented, the lack of LTTE \u2018buy-in\u2019 to the agreement proved",
  "disastrous. Under the terms of the ISLA, the Sri Lankan Government agreed to make constitu-",

  "enforcing an arms collection from the rebel groups. India\u2019s obligation essentially made it the",
  "guarantor of peace. The LTTE brie\ufb02y stopped \ufb01ghting, but did not hand over its weapons, and",
  "soon resumed violent insurgency\u2014this time against Indian troops. The provisions of the ISLA",
  "compelled the IPKF to engage the LTTE, which Indian intelligence had earlier helped train.",
  "The IPKF transformed from a peace-keeping mission into a counter-insurgency campaign,",
  "which India was ill-equipped to \ufb01ght on unfamiliar territory. The IPKF su\ufb00ered failure and",

  "India\u2019s involvement in Sri Lanka\u2019s ethnic con\ufb02ict transformed from heavy meddling, with",
  "both state and non-state actors, starting in 1983, to failed \u2018boots on the ground\u2019 intervention in",

  "This proved particularly di\ufb03cult during the latter part of the protracted con\ufb02ict in Sri Lanka",

  "India\u2019s chagrin, SriLanka turned to China to supplyitsmilitary. Withthe military defeat ofthe",

  "After India\u2019s 1991 economic reforms, trade between India and Sri Lanka jumped. Two-way",
  "trade between 1993 and 1996 doubled. This growth re\ufb02ected an explosion of Indian exports",

  "economic relationship heavily favoured India. This pattern of trade fed the Sri Lankan percep-",
  "tion of India as a regional hegemon: the large Indian economy was preying on its smaller and",
  "weaker neighbours.",
  "Still, both countries recognized the bene\ufb01ts of free trade with one another. When the",
  "SAARC Preferential Trading Arrangement (SAPTA) failed to signi\ufb01cantly reduce tari\ufb00s after it",

  "Since the ISLFTA, bilateral trade has markedly increased, accompanied by a surge of Indian",

  "TheISLFTA was much more than just an economic success. Bilateral economic engagement",
  "on the back of the ISLFTA is the hallmark of and impetus for improved Indo-Sri Lankan",

  "The trigger for this turn-around wasa conscious decision by the Indian policy establishment,",

  "trade.15 This decision foresaw the propitious e\ufb00ects of greater economic engagement in India\u2019s",

  "In April 2003 the two countries set up a Joint Study Group to enhance the ISLFTA with a",
  "Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA).16 The much-anticipated CEPA",
  "would further remove tari\ufb00 barriers on trade, create greater market access in the services sector,",
  "as well as stimulate greater Indian investment in Sri Lanka through an institutional framework.",
  "After more than a dozen rounds of negotiations, CEPA was supposed to be signed by India",
  "and Sri Lanka at the SAARC summit in Colombo in August 2008. However, it has been",
  "subject to delay, and as of August 2010 had still not been signed even though negotiations",
  "seemed to have been pretty well concluded. The India-Sri Lanka Joint Declaration, drawn up",
  "in the wake of President Rajapaksa\u2019s state visit in June 2010, was rather circumspect on the",
