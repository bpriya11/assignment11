  "Introduction",
  "This chapter investigates the roots of India\u2019s Great Power aspiration and how it has become",
  "normalized and conditioned by events in India\u2019s foreign and domestic relations, becoming part",
  "of India\u2019s self-perception and global self-image. By aspirations, I refer to the underlying aims,",
  "goals and interests that have continued to drive Indian foreign policy across di\ufb00erent political",
  "generations and political parties. For India, these aspirations have been based upon a consensus",
  "of ensuring India\u2019s emergence as a Great Power that is fully autonomous, in\ufb02uential and",
  "respected in the global comity of nations. Most commonly, such aspirations are based upon",
  "gaining parity with other great (and super) powers such as the People\u2019s Republic of China,",
  "Russia (formerly the USSR) and the USA, and most typically include gaining a permanent seat",
  "on the United Nations Security Council (UNSC). Underlying such desires are also fears of",
  "Indian in\ufb02uencebeing limited to South Asia, ofIndia being usedas a pawn in the international",
  "politics of others states (as was particularly apparent during the Cold War), and of losing her",
  "strategic autonomy.",
  "Whilst not representing a pre-ordained Grand Strategy, these aspirations are instead deeply",

  "Re\ufb02ective of these di\ufb00ering views, on one hand India\u2019s autonomy in international a\ufb00airs is",

  "to achieve Great Power status. This aspiration was rooted in the perceived standing of earlier",
  "Indian empires, the various conquering powers that had sought control of India (from the",
  "Greeks and Muslim invaders to the French and the British) and also India\u2019s physical location as",
  "the meeting point of Asia.5 These beliefs combined with India\u2019s struggle for independence,",
  "which India\u2019s leaders interpreted as part of an \u2018Asian Renaissance\u2019 with a dynamic and pro-",

  "of developing both independent capabilities and national self-worth. Despite these more force-",

  "aspirations continued to be peaceful, dominated by the understanding \u2018that power-seeking",
  "provokes power-seeking, force begets force\u2019.6 Indian policy consequently led to her neither",

  "India\u2019s aspiration to Great Power status begins with the perceived greatness of earlier Indian",

  "autonomous separation. Furthermore, the ascriptive and hierarchical criteria of the Hindu caste",
  "system reinforced an expectancy of greatness among the country\u2019s elites whereby \u2018India\u2019s status",
  "is a given, not earned\u2019.8",
  "When colonial rule ended, India was left with territorial issues as a legacy of the Partition of",
  "British India into India and Pakistan. The demarcation of India\u2019s northern borders through the",
  "Curzon and the McMahon lines, and disputes concerning their validity, directly led to border",
  "issues with China and territorial claims over Jammu and Kashmir with Pakistan. These issues",
  "initially con\ufb01ned India\u2019s interaction within the global system to South Asia, made successive",
  "Indiangovernments fearfuloftheircountry\u2019sBalkanizationandresulted(directlyandindirectly)",
  "in wars with China in 1962, and with Pakistan in 1947, 1965, 1971 and 1999. Partition",
  "therefore instilled an inherent distrust of outside forces that had formed the new borders of",
  "India and Pakistan, an action seemingly undertaken to inspire instability in the region by failing",
  "to synchronize with ethnic and state borders. The creation of a lasting legacy of multiple cross-",
  "border and internal security problems evidenced this perception. A resultant anti-imperialist",
  "attitude would go on to manifest itself into both anti-Chinese and anti-US sentiments (over",
  "their roles in Pakistan), and even anti-UN sentiment (over any attempts at mediating the",
  "Kashmir issue). These suspicions furthermore tempered a desire for India to independently gain",
  "Great Power status.",
  "As both India\u2019s \ufb01rst Prime Minister and \ufb01rst Minister of Defence, the beliefs of Jawaharlal",
  "Nehru dominated the making of Indian foreign policy from 1947 until his death in 1964.",
  "Central to these beliefs was that India had \u2018special rights and duties in the management of",
  "internationalsocietybasedonitsstatusasoneoftheworld\u2019smajorcivilisations\u2019.9Inturn,India\u2019s",
  "international interaction was to be a form of positive neutralism based upon purna swaraj",
  "(complete independence), consisting of an independent foreign policy and separation from big",
  "power games, also often termed as enlightened national self-interest. Such a policy was central",
  "to establishing India as an inherently self-determining, powerful and stable nation on the",
  "international stage. Mahatma Gandhi\u2019s principles of ahimsa (non-violence) further imbued India",
  "with an aversion to pure power approaches, in\ufb02uencing how she wished to achieve Great",
  "Power status. Ahimsa was linked to ideas of an emerging alternative world order after the",
  "Second World War in which the use of force was minimal, racialism was repudiated and",
  "countries were emancipated from imperialism.",
  "India\u2019sleadershipoftheNon-AlignedMovement(NAM)\u2014whichitco-foundedinBelgrade",
  "in 1961\u2014endeavoured to counteractthe rigid dichotomies ofa ColdWarworld dominatedby",
  "the USA and USSR. Non-alignment also generated moral in\ufb02uence for India and reinforced",
  "arguments that to ally with either of the two superpower blocs would e\ufb00ectively mortgage",
  "India\u2019s future rise and emergence as a Great Power. In the \ufb01rst decades of her independence,",
  "this belief existed \u2018regardless of the realities of what India is\u2019,10 as India\u2019s leaders saw Great",
  "Power status as based upon moral idealism rather than territorial, economic or military indica-",
  "tors. Employment of this language also helped to portray India as a self-assured and thoroughly",
  "independent power. As such, the NAM created a powerful forum for Indian interests and goals",
  "in international politics, where it became the second largest multilateral diplomatic organization",
  "after the UN. Overall, non-alignment became an article of faith for India\u2019s leaders and strategic",
  "community that allowed the nation to become established as an independent voice in interna-",
  "tional politics.",
  "Non-alignment was neither isolationist nor neutral as India criticized various states over their",
  "policies in Korea, Congo, Suez and Viet Nam. Re\ufb02ecting India\u2019s own experiences, such criti-",
  "cism targeted expansionist powers rather than speci\ufb01c ideologies. The policy of economic self-",

  "submit to any kind of economic domination to any country\u2019.11 These notions were under-",
  "pinned and exempli\ufb01ed by the implementation of an economic and science-and-technology",
  "policy, which included nuclear power through the establishment of the Atomic Energy Com-",
  "mission in 1948 and the Department of Atomic Energy in 1954. Furthermore, eschewing arms",

  "contain the USSR and to protect the Gulf. Additionally, following Indian state visits to",
  "Moscow and Beijing in the 1950s, US o\ufb03cials became convinced that India was part of the",

  "in which India was humiliated.13 This defeat forced India to accept \u2018that the pursuit of a major",
  "power role in the absence of hard power or military capabilities was a chimera\u2019.14 As such, the",
  "1962 experience \u2018socialized\u2019 India into the international order, as Indian leaders and strategic",

  "20-year Treaty of Peace, Friendship and Co-operation with the USSR. This treaty protected",
  "India from UN censure by the USA, balanced against the Islamabad-Beijing-Washington line-",

  "Pakistan and India\u2019s consequent \u2018liberation\u2019 of East Pakistan into Bangladesh showed India",
  "capable of successfully \ufb01ghting a limited con\ufb02ict and of rede\ufb01ning her strategic environment.",
  "Subsequently, post-1971, India emerged as the foremost power on the subcontinent; 1971",
  "furthermore con\ufb01rmed the ongoing morality present within India\u2019s aspiration to Great Power",
  "status and remains as a rare case of successful state-to-state humanitarian intervention. These",
  "events also emboldened India\u2019s acquisition of nuclear weapons, achieved through the Peaceful",
  "Nuclear Explosion (PNE) of May 1974. The tests were emblematic of its criticism of the per-",

  "Permanent Members of the UN Security Council and the Non-Nuclear Proliferation Treaty",
  "(NPT) of 1968 that protected their exclusive nuclear status.",
  "Assuring India\u2019s regional hegemony was a key step to achieving Great Power status and was",
  "primarily carried out by denying external powers any in\ufb02uence in South Asia. This policy is",
  "often referred to as the Indira/Rajiv Doctrine, named after two prime ministers who led India",
  "in the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s. As part of this doctrine, Indian military power was used as a",
  "deterrent and as an interventionist force in the region, with India engaging in bilateral peace-",
  "keeping operations in Sri Lanka (1971 and 1987\u201390) and in the Maldives (1988), as well as an",
  "economic blockade of Nepal in 1989\u201390. While not always wholly successful\u2014as with the",
  "1987\u201390 peace-keeping operations in Sri Lanka\u2014India embraced such interventionist policies",
  "towards South Asia, which it abhorred if applied to itself. In the face of heightening energy",
  "needs and deeper economic relations, Indian policy towards the region changed in the 1990s,",
  "mainlythroughtheactionsofPrimeMinisterI.K.Gujral,whoe\ufb00ectivelygaveupreciprocityin",
  "bilateral a\ufb00airs. Regarded as necessary to counter the in\ufb02uence of states such as Pakistan, China",
  "and the USA, the Gujral Doctrine instead based regional relations upon good will and bene-",
  "volence.15",
  "Building on its paramount subcontinent status and pre-existing treaty-based security rela-",
  "tionshipswith Bhutan andNepaldatingfrom 1949\u201350, Indianleaders also attempted to initiate",
  "some forms of Asian multilateralism. These e\ufb00orts dated from Nehru\u2019s Asian Relations Con-",
  "ference in March 1947 and calls in 1967 for an Asian Council. As such, India stepped up mul-",
  "tilateral links within the region in order to improve her stability and trade links and most",
  "importantly to increase India\u2019s global standing. This policy included joining various multilateral",
  "bodies such as the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) in 1985,",
  "BIMSTEC (Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Coopera-",
  "tion\u2014formerly Bangladesh, India, Sri Lanka, Thailand Economic Cooperation) in 1997, and",
  "links with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) from 1992 onwards. These",
  "latter links rested upon India creating further military, economic and diplomatic ties with",
  "South-East Asia through the \u2018Look East\u2019 policy, which built upon her religious, artistic, lin-",
  "guistic and political legacies to the region. Through such policies India steadily extended her",
  "regional dominance beyond South Asia, emboldening her global Great Power aspirations. In",
  "general (and by the 1990s), such eastern-looking policies held greater importance to India\u2019s",
  "policy-makers than her relations towards West Asia.",
  "India\u2019s aspirations to achieve Great Power status also contained engrained beliefs of her nat-",
  "ural supremacy in the Indian Ocean Region (IOR). Apart from inheriting the British coloni-",
  "alists\u2019 Curzonian arc from Aden to Singapore, this domination rested upon historical elements",
  "whereby British, Dutch and French colonialists had all invaded India from the sea. As such,",
  "India insisted that the Great Powers leave the Indian Ocean, and in the 1960s and 1970s",

  "Indian Ocean Rim Association for Regional Co-operation (IOR-ARC) in 1995, a trade asso-",
  "ciation composed of 18 member states. By the 1990s the security importance of the IOR was",
  "underscored as India became the biggest consumer of natural gas from the Gulf, Central Asia",
  "and South-East Asia. Corresponding increases in her economic growth ameliorated her Great",
  "Power aspirations. Rising strategic competition with Pakistan and China increased this impor-",
  "tance, and was underpinned by India having the most developed navy in the Indian Ocean.16",
  "On a wider spectrum, India remained suspicious of foreign investment, multinational cor-",
  "porations and a gradually globalizing economic order. Such external \ufb01nancial mechanisms were",
  "regarded as threatening swadeshi through coercive and restrictive multilateral organizations such",
  "as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Trade Organization (WTO). How-",

  "dual liberalization would be resolutely spurred on by the 1991 balance of payments crisis.",
  "In these ways, the advantages of economic liberalization in terms of status acquisition were",
  "gradually being acknowledged by India\u2019s leaders, especially as a way to engage with the inter-",
  "national system\u2019s Great Powers, such as the USA. Such understandings also recognized the",
  "realitiesofapost-ColdWarworld,which haddisruptedexistingIndo-USSRlinks,increasingly",
  "made the NAM irrelevant and demanded new foreign policy dimensions if Great Power status",
  "was to be achieved. However, anti-US sentiments remained as India\u2019s perception of the USA",
  "directly acting against her interests continued during the 1980s, particularly as the USA sent",
  "arms via Pakistan to counter the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979. As the Cold War",
  "ended, US strategic disinterest grew, in conjunction with the Soviet withdrawal from Afgha-",
  "nistan in 1989. China would, however, continue to support Pakistan throughout this period",
  "and their aid indirectly helped Pakistan, in turn, to support the insurgency that erupted in",
  "Indian-controlled Kashmir during the 1980s.",
  "Overall, by the 1990s India was steadily increasing her regional and international status en",
  "route to her goal of acquiring Great Power status. In response to its interaction internationally,",
  "India\u2019s core belief in becoming a Great Power remained in place, now characterized by an",
  "injection of realpolitik and continued anti-imperialism towards the USA and China. These atti-",

  "and the United Kingdom did not. By questioning the dominant global nuclear consensus (and",
  "being the \ufb01rst country to proclaim a newnuclear status since China in 1964), the Pokhrantests",
  "brought India into the global political, economic and strategic mainstream.",
  "High levels of Indian diplomacy also came to characterize India\u2019s mainstream re-integration,",

  "East Asia. Critically, the USA began to accept the new consequences of India in terms of her",
  "economy, nuclear capabilities, stable democracy and large middle class. Such respect and",
  "acceptance increased India\u2019s international standing and made closer US ties a new pillar of",
  "India\u2019s foreign policy. In turn, India became a key strategic partner of the USA, witnessed in",
  "their bilateral Defence Agreement drawn up in 2005.23",
  "As India\u2019s international pro\ufb01le increased, heightened trade levels and greater military-to-",

  "India\u2019s links to the international community and international economy, con\ufb01rming her status",

  "economic links with her neighbourhood have become more stable.25",
  "Conclusions",
  "Over the last 60 years, an aspiration to achieve Great Power status has become a normalized",
  "feature of Indian foreign policy. Through the legacies of colonial powers and Nehru, this",
  "aspiration developed through continued international interaction. Much of this development",
  "came from learning the lessons of systemic realpolitik, such as India\u2019s defeat by China in 1962,",
  "wars in 1965 and 1971 with Pakistan, and forcing the world\u2019s attention towards India with the",
  "nuclear tests of 1998. From these events we can expect India\u2019s Great Power aspiration to con-",
  "tinue and to become more heightened, while being tempered by a suspicion of outside powers",
  "and the maintenance of Indian autonomy in all areas. The core sentiments within India\u2019s Great",
  "Power aspiration\u2014anti-imperialism, self-reliance and being unaligned\u2014will remain integral to",
  "suchadisposition.Assuch,theverynatureofIndia\u2019sGreatPoweraspirationmaybepotentially",
  "debilitating to its full integration into the global economy (for fear of losing self-reliance), and",
  "willcertainlymilitateagainstanyall-weatheralliances.Instead,strategicpartnershipswill\ufb02ourish",
  "where the political and economic gains for India are clear. Of note here is that despite di\ufb00erent",
  "political parties being in power in India, this consensus on Great Power status has remained",
  "unchanged, suggesting a normative durability in the belief and approach to the acquisition of",
  "Great Power status.",
  "According to Nayar, power has 10 features.26 Four of these are \u2018hard\u2019 features: the military;",
  "the economy; technology; and demographics. Six of these are \u2018soft\u2019 features: norms (which can",
  "be de\ufb01ned as beliefs, hopes, fears); leadership of international forums; culture; state capacity;",
  "strategy and diplomacy; and national leadership. In symbiosis, these virtues translate into power",
  "and in\ufb02uence within the international system concerning security provision, the determination",
  "and style of \ufb01nancial institutions, and the control of knowledge acquisition and dissemination.",
  "Currently the USA is the only complete power in regard of all these power virtues.",

  "While India is accurately seen as a candidate Great Power, her border issues are stumbling",

  "in\ufb02uences on separatists within India, especially the Naxalites who early in the 21st century",
  "were active in a third of the country, as well as other groups in her north-east. India\u2019s popula-",
  "tion is also India\u2019s potential Achilles\u2019 heel as it modernizes, draining resources for a population",
  "that currently remains generally highly illiterate, unskilled and impoverished. The challenge to",
  "ameliorate such conditions seems even harder when comparisons with other major powers are",
  "made, and it will take some time to achieve higher living standards. High incidences of cor-",
  "ruption, bureaucratic lethargy and apathy in law implementation, all exacerbate these factors.",
  "However, as India\u2019s economy continues to expand and investment continues to \ufb01lter out",
  "through the country\u2019s states to its vast population, it is reasonable to expect that, with time,",
  "many of these issues can and will be resolved. Although India may never achieve a permanent",
