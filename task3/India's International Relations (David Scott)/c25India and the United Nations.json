  "To this day, Indian strategic commentators and rightist critics of Nehru bemoan his cardinal",
  "mistake of taking the Kashmir dispute to a UN that was packed with pro-Pakistani partisan",

  "Great Power alignments and preferences that were paralysing and hijacking the UN.",
  "Nehru could have opportunistically capitalized on Cold War polarization at the UN to",
  "secure for India a Permanent Seat on the Security Council, but missed the boat twice in the",
  "1950s to the perpetual dismay of future generations of Indians. In 1952 Washington o\ufb00ered",
  "India entry as the sixth Permanent Member, in order to keep China out of contention and to",
  "leave the Kuomintang of Taiwan in its place as the UN-recognized Chinese regime. Nehru,",
  "who was anxious then to accommodate Mao Tse Tung\u2019s China, rejected the o\ufb00er on the",
  "grounds that it would sow divisions between New Delhi and Beijing, and would split Third",
  "Worldunity againstWesternneo-imperialism.In1955SovietPrimeMinisterNikolaiBulganin",
  "issued a similar o\ufb00er that would have entailed bypassing Maoist China and would have made",
  "India a veto-wielding member of the Security Council. Again, Nehru insisted on a stage-by-",
  "stage admission process wherein, \u2018we should \ufb01rst concentrate on getting [communist] China",
