  "they are articulated owing to India\u2019s encounter with the Central Asian agency of other inter-",
  "national actors\u2014especially Russia and the People\u2019s Republic of China. In other words, the",

  "the constructs of the Look North policy indicate a desire to emulate India\u2019s \u2018Look East\u2019",
  "approach to South-East Asia, seen elsewhere. On the one hand, just like in the case of its",
  "relations with South-East Asia, the narratives of the Look North policy intend to demonstrate",
  "India\u2019s ability to \u2018break out of the claustrophobic con\ufb01nes of South Asia\u2019.2 On the other hand,",
  "unlike the Look East policy, the Look North approach to Central Asia has remained mostly a",
  "discursive platform for Indian pundits and commentators rather than an actual government",

  "Organization (SCO) in Central Asia. In particular, the encounter with the SCO reveals the",
  "complex attitudes informing India\u2019s relations with Russia and China in the post-Cold War",
  "period. The chapter concludes by demonstrating the relative lack of in\ufb02uence in India\u2019s Central",
  "Asian agency. The contention is that New Delhi\u2019s international image has few appealing attri-",
  "butes that regional states in Central Asia might be tempted to emulate.",
  "The narrative outlines of India\u2019s Look North policy",
  "During a visit to Turkmenistan in September 1995, the then Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha",
  "Raoannouncedthat\u2018forIndia\u2019,CentralAsiawasanarea\u2018ofhighpriority,whereweaimtostay",
  "engaged far into the future. We are an independent partner with no sel\ufb01sh motives. We only",
  "desire honest and open friendship and to promote stability and cooperation without causing",
  "harm to any third country\u2019.4 Rao\u2019s proclamation o\ufb00ers a glimpse into the discursive genesis of",
  "the Look North policy.5",
  "Most commentators insist that India\u2019s engagement with Central Asia is a function of the",
  "country\u2019s historical interactions with the region. Thus, the \u2018long-standing historical ties",
  "encompassing the political, cultural, economic, and religious dimensions\u2019 form the premise for",
  "the current international relations between New Delhi and the region.6 Yet, alongside these",
  "proclamations of extensive historical associations, observers have also acknowledged that while",
  "\u2018Central Asia is closer to New Delhi then Chennai or Bangkok, Tashkent and Almaty ring a",
  "distant bell when the names pop up in casual conversations\u2019.7 Such attitudes indicate that even",
  "after the break-up of the USSR, New Delhi only very gradually began to develop an under-",
  "standing of Central Asia\u2019s importance to the dynamics of South Asian a\ufb00airs. This realization",
  "seems to have been one of the underlying features in the transformation of India\u2019s post-Cold",
  "War foreign policy.",
  "In this context, the articulations of India\u2019s Look-North to Central Asia have come to stress",
  "the need for a \u2018proactive and meaningful policy that accords top priority to the region\u2019.8 Thus,",
  "the narrative exploitation of the legacies of the past by Indian foreign policy elites discloses a",
  "strategy that aims \u2018to remind the new generation in Central Asia that India is not new to them",
  "but rather a very old friend\u2019.9 Consequently, India is presented as a model for Central Asian",
  "states. It is claimed that in their search for \u2018support and constructive cooperation\u2019,",
  "India stood as an attractive direction to relate to. India was not only a multiethnic, multi-",
  "cultural, resilient society with vast experience of managing delicate intra-ethnic relations,",
  "but also a secular and democratic polity. [At the same time], India was geographically dis-",
  "tant, but culturally and historically close, without any record of an intrusive or aggressive",
  "behaviour towards the newly emerged Central Asian republics.10",
  "Such statements indicate that the Look North policy did not emerge in a vacuum, but was",
  "profoundly implicated by the post-Cold War trajectories of India\u2019s foreign policy-making.",
  "The formulation of a country\u2019s international interactions o\ufb00ers discursive platforms for the",
  "manifestation of national self-positioning on the world stage and the re-contextualization of",
  "historical narratives to the exigencies of the present. The following sections sketch out these",
  "dynamics.",

  "sented \u2018the loss of an entire world\u2019.11 New Delhi\u2019s external outlook had to confront several",

  "in the absence of its erstwhile ally\u2014the USSR\u2014while at the same time acknowledging the",

  "making became frustrated by the increasing tension between \u2018militarism\u2019 (i.e. coercive interna-",
  "tional stance) and \u2018moralism\u2019 (i.e. co-operative international stance). Consequently, India\u2019s",

  "meaningfullyaccommodatethedesireforamoreassertiveroleontheglobalstagewhilelacking",
  "the con\ufb01dence that it can and should do so.12",
  "Thus,the\u2018post-ColdWarblues\u2019,whichinfectedIndia\u2019sinternationala\ufb00airsduringthe1990s,",
  "made India\u2019s relations with Central Asia one of the most conspicuous aspects of its foreign",
  "policyambiguityduringthisperiod.TheuncertaintydominatingNewDelhi\u2019soutlookhadtwo",
  "important implications:",
  "One was that there emerged a new Central Asia, independent and sovereign, freed from",
  "the control of the former Soviet Union, and looking forward to a greater and dynamic",
  "engagement with the rest of the world, particularly Asia. The second was a sort of crisis of",
  "con\ufb01denceinIndia\u2019sforeignpolicyperspectiveresultingfromthecollapseoftheColdWar",
  "framework of global politics and the consequent erosion of the former Soviet Union as a",
  "source of foreign policy support.13",
  "However, India\u2019s failure to engage Central Asia more convincingly in this period is an out-",
  "come not only of the \u2018post-Cold War blues\u2019, but also of the formulation of New Delhi\u2019s",
  "external relations in reaction to Pakistan\u2019s foreign policy strategies. In \u2018Indian perceptions\u2019,",
  "Pakistan has \u2018vested interests\u2019 in pursuing a \u2018quest for strategic depth vis-\u00e0-vis India in Central",
  "Asia\u2019.14 The assertion is that the \u2018philosophy [of Pakistan\u2019s interactions with the region]",
  "appears to have always focused on a prescriptive approach as to what should happen in or to",
  "the Central Asian states within the overall backdrop of deep antagonism against India\u2019.15",
  "India\u2019s Look North to Central Asia has therefore extended a non-Pakistani alternative to the",
  "region.",
  "Thus, for the better part of the 1990s the \u2018ill-conceived [and] ill-executed treatment [of",
  "CentralAsia]asacounterpoisebetweenIndiaandPakistan\u2019hastendedtobefuddleNewDelhi\u2019s",
  "foreign policy-making.16 In particular, the framework of India\u2019s Look North policy illustrates",
  "New Delhi\u2019s inability to obviate both the legacy of mistrust between India and Pakistan as well",
  "as the very real barrier posed by Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK). Thus, while \u2018neither India",
  "nor Pakistan is an immediate neighbour of Central Asia\u2019, the export of the con\ufb02ict between",
  "New Delhi and Islamabad to Central Asia can be described as an \u2018avoidable small game\u2019.17",
  "Moreover, the policy attitudes that dominated India\u2019s strategic thinking on Central Asia for",
  "much ofthe \ufb01rst post-Cold Wardecade indicated thatNew Delhi\u2019s foreign policy outlook was",
  "in\ufb02uenced by the constraints of its South Asian context. Thus, for most of this period, India\u2019s",
  "foreign policy formulation remained in the grips of conceptual tensions, strategic uncertainty",
  "and geopolitical limitations, which hampered the extension of a coherent policy towards",
  "Central Asia.",

  "mations of the region\u2019s \u2018historical belonging\u2019 to India\u2019s \u2018strategic neighbourhood\u2019, New Delhi",
  "was \u2018not giving su\ufb03cient attention to Central Asia\u2019; consequently, \u2018good intentions have not",
  "been converted into substantive relations\u2019.20 The stated overarching objective of India\u2019s Look",
  "North policy is the promotion of \u2018peace and mutual prosperity\u2019.21 This intent, however, has",
  "been buttressed by the twin ambition of: a) maintaining \u2018the democratic and secular ethos\u2019 of",
  "the region, because it \u2018binds India and Central Asia together\u2019; b) evolving \u2018measures that would",

  "foreign policy, c) India has engaged in strategic bilateral relations in Central Asia in an attempt",
  "to overcome its marginalization in the region.22 The following sections outline these three",
  "approaches.",
  "Experience of managing diversity within a secular and democratic polity",
  "Indiancommentatorshavenotedthatthe(violenceaccompanyingthe)dissolutionoftheUSSR",
  "and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia has \u2018eroded the legitimacy of multi-ethnic, multi-lin-",
  "gual, and multi-religious states\u2019.23 This observation informs the (tacit) conviction that India is",
  "one of the remaining countries that share the characteristic features of the now defunct socialist",
  "federations. Consequently, such a realization underpins the responsibility of its foreign policy-",
  "making to assert the viability of India\u2019s state-building project by demonstrating the relevance",
  "and experience in successfully managing its internal diversity through the institutional arrange-",
  "ments of a secular and democratic polity. In other words, India is not \u2018multicultural by acci-",
  "dent\u2019, but \u2018multicultural by design\u2019.24 Consequently, India\u2019s strategic objective in the region is",
  "to \u2018work for the rise and consolidation of democratic and secular polities in Central Asia,",
  "because the spill-over of the rise of religious extremism may threaten India\u2019s own internal sta-",
  "bility and security\u2019.25",
  "Indian e\ufb00orts and expectations, however, have been frustrated by the realization that the",
  "Central Asian republics \u2018were ill-prepared for independence\u2019.26 Although \u2018conversant in the art",

  "collective security arrangement and a collective project for the development of all the",
  "countries of the region regardless of their policy slants in favour of this or that great",
  "power\u2019.30 This insistence on the unity of Central Asian states re\ufb02ects Indian perceptions of",
  "the pragmatic bene\ufb01ts from (even a rudimentary form of functional) co-operation which",
  "\u2018transforms conventional aspirations into more open, dynamic, and wider practices of",
  "peaceful coexistence, collective responsibility, and development\u2019.31 The fear is that without",
  "regional integration, history might repeat itself and Central Asia may lose \u2018its creative",
  "capacity [just like it did] during the sixteenth century, owing to its internecine warfare,",
  "internal instability, and external aggressive policy\u2019.32",
  "In this respect, there seems to be a signi\ufb01cant level of disappointment among Indian com-",
  "mentators that \u2018the political leadership of these countries has been unable to evolve a mind-set",
  "that could be truly characterized as [Central Asian]\u2019.33 Such a failure tends to be explained",
  "through the pursuit of narrow personal gains by nepotistic state elites, which (more often than",
  "not) are disguised under the narrative cloak of (ethno-)national interests. Thus, commentators",
  "have noted that the failure of Central Asian states to establish a robust framework for regional",
  "co-operation illustrates their weak structures of governance.",
  "The regionalization implicit in the discourses of the Look North policy exposes a convic-",
  "tion that it is India\u2019s \u2018purpose to engage more vigorously with an independent Central Asia",
  "through cultural structures\u2019.34 In this respect, some Indian commentators have suggested that",
  "the alleged \u2018homogeneity [of the region] is quite deceptive\u2019 and hinders the comprehension of",
  "the \u2018diversity, which is articulated in many di\ufb00erent ways\u2019 in the convoluted dynamics of",
  "Central Asian politics.35 Thus, the suggestion is that India needs to accompany its regionalizing",
  "approach with \u2018country-speci\ufb01c\u2019 strategies targeting the individual Central Asian republics.",
  "This understanding informs the discussion of India\u2019s bilateral relations with regional states in",

  "involvement in the region has been paralleled by a signi\ufb01cant level of bilateral relations in an",
  "attempt to overcome the constraints imposed by its latecomer status in Central Asian a\ufb00airs. In",
  "this respect, it is Tajikistan that\u2014to all intents and purposes\u2014has become the centrepiece of",
  "New Delhi\u2019s strategic bilateralism in Central Asia.",
  "The construction of Tajikistan as India\u2019s \u2018gateway to Central Asia\u201936 is of complex prove-",
  "nance in the narratives of the Look North policy. The hackneyed point of departure seems to",
  "be the observation of a \u2018millennia-old\u2019, \u2018civilizational relationship between Tajikistan and the",
  "Indian subcontinent\u2019.37 Strategically speaking, however, it is the shared perception of external",
  "threats that appears to motivate India\u2019s bilateral relations with Tajikistan. Indian commentators",
  "explain that the civil war which ravaged the country during the 1990s has been \u2018caused by a",
  "skilful exploitation of the inter-regional/inter-clan rivalries by forces of Islamic fundamentalism",
  "supported by the Pakistan-backed Mujahideen in Afghanistan\u2019; i.e., it was \u2018a spill-over of the",
  "victory of the Mujahideen armed groups in Afghanistan. The jobless Afghan jehadis found",
  "employment both in Tajikistan and in the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir\u2019.38 Thus, India",
  "responded with logistic and military support for the anti-Taliban Northern Alliance through",
  "Tajikistan.",

  "o\ufb00er of \u2018humanitarian assistance\u2019, in 2000 India formally acknowledged the establishment of a",
  "military hospital on the Tajikistan\u2013Afghanistan border at Farkhor, and the widening of a mili-",
  "tary air-strip near Dushanbe for transport aircraft.41 More recently, India\u2014still \u2018quietly, very",

  "New Delhi to consider the possibility of sending troops abroad outside of the UN framework\u2019.43",
  "Thus, India\u2019s military presence in Tajikistan becomes one of the most conspicuous indications",
  "of the presumed assertive logic of its post-1998 foreign policy. In this respect, India\u2019s involve-",
  "ment in Central Asia exposes an underlying \u2018revisionist\u2019 foreign policy stance\u2014through which",
  "New Delhi aims to revise the existing patterns in its international environment in order to",
  "facilitate the exercise of its own agency.44",
  "Thus, the intense ties with Tajikistan reveal India\u2019s attempt to carve out a space for its stakes",
  "in Central Asia. At the same time, such bilateral relations do not demonstrate a socializing",
  "propensity that might become the cornerstone of a more encompassing community of practice",
  "in the region. What has been particularly frustrating for the proponents of the Look North",
  "policy is that while India\u2019s longing for closer relations with Central Asia has largely remained",
  "unful\ufb01lled, other actors in the meantime have managed to establish themselves as important",
  "partners to the region. The following section details the complex context of such an encounter",
  "in India\u2019s Central Asian policy.",
  "Shanghaied into co-operation? Indian attitudes towards the SCO",
  "The nuclear con\ufb01dence of India\u2019s post-1998 foreign policy has endeavoured to project the",
  "image of a self-aggrandizing state capable of charting its course in the uncertain currents of",
  "global politics. However, while Looking North towards Central Asia, India has quickly recog-",
  "nized that it is not the only international actor striving to assert its agency in the region.",
  "It is the awareness of this dynamic context that has made Indian observers particularly per-",
  "plexed by the seemingly rapid emergence of the SCO as an increasingly sophisticated institu-",
  "tional architecture for Central Asian a\ufb00airs. The development of the SCO has con\ufb01rmed the",
  "viewpoint that the region has become the host of a \u2018new great game\u2019.45 The former ambassa-",

  "Visualize a three-dimensional, multiplayer chessboard, where a move by each protagonist",
  "produces eddies and back\ufb02ows that a\ufb00ect all the others, and prompt counter-movements.",
  "Factor into this, the time as a fourth dimension, which takes this analogy beyond easy",
  "description. [Central Asia] resembles such a turbulent, volatile, and unpredictable scene",
  "owing to the mix of cooperation [and] contestation that marks virtually each bilateral",

  "present a more complex picture of the relations between New Delhi and Moscow than their",
  "bilateral interactions suggest. On the one hand, Russian support for India\u2019s inclusion as an",
  "observer in the SCO (and seemingly currently for India\u2019s full membership)51 con\ufb01rms the per-",
  "ception that the two countries have a shared interest in the stability of Central Asia. This then",
  "underpins the awareness that \u2018Russia would likeIndia to becomea big player in the region asa",
  "balancing factor for both the American and Chinese presence\u2019.52",
  "On the other hand, many Indian commentators assert that Moscow no longer has the over-",
  "bearing presence in Central Asia that it once had. In this respect, the perceived weakness of",
  "Moscow\u2019s foreign policy stance towards Central Asia has clashed with the assertiveness of New",
  "Delhi\u2019s post-1998 external relations. Thus, their interactions within the SCO framework have",
  "convinced some observers that \u2018beyond oil and arms sales, India \ufb01nds little common ground",
  "with Russia\u2019.53 At the same time, Moscow\u2019s willingness to involve third parties\u2014in particular",
  "China\u2014in its Central Asian interactions have con\ufb01rmed Russia\u2019s \u2018loss of its [Central] Asian",
  "republics\u2019.54",
  "For Indian commentators, therefore, the SCO epitomizes an alliance between Russia and",
  "China, which con\ufb01rms that from Moscow\u2019s point of view \u2018China is a more \ufb01tting partner for",
  "Russia\u2019s multifaceted interests in Central Asia than India\u2019.55 A signi\ufb01cant part of Indian hostility",
  "towards Russia\u2019s involvement in the region, therefore, derives from Moscow\u2019s departure from",
  "its usual framework of foreign policy behaviour. Thus, the patterns of divergence in India\u2019s",
  "encounter with Russia in Central Asia reveal that owing to the exigencies of domestic and",
  "global politics, there is very little degree of certainty regarding the future trajectories of New",
  "Delhi\u2019s interactions with Moscow. What appears certain, however, is that the glory days of the",
  "Cold War \u2018special relationship\u2019 between the two countries have petered out.",

  "The SCO and India\u2019s encounter with China in Central Asia",
  "For many Indian commentators, China\u2019s ability to establish the SCO in 2001 has become one",
  "of the clearest indications of the post-Cold War dynamism of Central Asian a\ufb00airs. The SCO",
  "hastherebyenhancedthevisibilityof\u2018China\u2019seconomicandpoliticalinterestsintheregion[\u2026",
  "inthe]politicsofoilandgas\u2019,inwhichIndialostouttoChinaovercompetitionforKazakhstan",
  "energy in 2005.56 In this setting, India\u2019s encounter with the SCO has provoked distinct images",
  "of Beijing\u2019s regional agency\u2014ranging from a threat, through a partner, to a model. Although",
  "not necessarily complementary, such diverse representations cohabit simultaneously within the",
  "narratives of the Look North policy.",
  "Perhaps the most interesting image of China, provoked by India\u2019s confrontation with the",
  "SCO, is that of a model. A number of commentators have suggested that New Delhi\u2019s",
  "encounter with Beijing\u2019s agency in Central Asia has produced the image of \u2018China as a role",
  "model\u2019 for India\u2019s external relations.57 The realization is that Beijing\u2019s experience provides",
  "useful instruction for New Delhi\u2019s own engagement in the region. Thus, the consideration of",
  "SCO in the narratives of the Look North policy suggests that if India is to become the Great",
  "Power that it proclaims to be, it needs to learn from (if not emulate) the model set-up by",
  "Beijing.",
  "A number of these \u2018lessons\u2019 relate to the structure, process and content of India\u2019s relations",
  "with the region. Thus, in contrast to India, China\u2019s initiatives in Central Asia indicate the",
  "development of a sophisticated \u2018holistic view\u2019 of foreign policy-making, which \u2018embeds the",
  "state \ufb01rmly within the interstate system as an organic and inseparable part, linking the fate even",
  "of the inside of the state to the fate or nature of its outside\u2019.58 Indian perceptions of the SCO,",
  "therefore, have provoked a desire to emulate Beijing\u2019s ability to \u2018establish quickly an interna-",
  "tionalreputationfor beingableto lookafter itself[and,thus] becomea \u201cgreatpower\u201d,whereas",
  "India\u2019s potential remains unrealized\u2019.59 Consequently, encounter with Beijing\u2019s involvement in",
  "Central Asia has produced diverse assessments of the SCO within the narratives of India\u2019s Look",
  "North policy, all of which tend to re\ufb02ect the di\ufb03culties in articulating a foreign policy strategy",
  "in a complex world.",
  "Conclusions",
  "The discussion of the narratives of the Look North policy con\ufb01rms New Delhi\u2019s foreign policy",
  "desire that India becomes \u2018a kind of a model for other countries\u2019.60 The proclivity towards a",
  "discursive projection of India as a blueprint for Central Asian development has become a",
  "de\ufb01ning feature of the Look North policy. Yet, as demonstrated, the confrontation with the",
  "reality of Central Asian interactions and the involvement of other international actors\u2014espe-",
  "ciallyChina\u2014makesconspicuousthatNewDelhihaslittle(ifany)in\ufb02uenceintheregion.Not",
  "surprisingly, therefore, India\u2019s perception of the strengthening of the Beijing-based SCO has",
  "further aggravated New Delhi\u2019s irritation of international, and regional, acceptance of China as",
  "being the next global power. Thus, despite the proliferation of discourses on India\u2019s rise to",
  "global prominence, the absence of a readily available Indian \u2018vision\u2019 of global politics prevents",
  "New Delhi from living up to the expectations generated by such narratives.",
  "The absence of a meaningful power of attraction (soft power) has undermined India\u2019s inter-",
  "national engagement with Central Asia. This has been re\ufb02ected in \u2018India\u2019s noticeable absence\u2019",
  "fromCentralAsianpolitics.61Itisalsore\ufb02ectedinIndia\u2019sweakpositioninwhatShenconsiders",
  "\u2018India\u2019s absence from ideological energy diplomacy in Central Asia\u2019, in which \u2018India lacks a",

  "narratives of the Look North policy has demonstrated that the discursive construction of India\u2019s",
  "current external a\ufb00airs does not project a speci\ufb01c (if any) vision of world order that would",

  "power\u2019 for longer than its pundits portend, remaining in \u2018the class of countries that are always",
