  "Introduction",
  "India\u2019s involvement in regional integration is the focus of this chapter. This chapter starts with",
  "India\u2019s immediate neighbourhood (i.e. South Asia) and India\u2019s sense of identity within that region",
  "and with regard to the regional structure there, i.e. the South Asian Association of Regional",
  "Cooperation (SAARC). It then moves on to India\u2019s extended neighbourhood beyond South Asia",
  "(i.e. the Indian Ocean, the Bay of Bengal and East Asia), and India\u2019s sense of identity within",
  "those regions and with regard to their regional structures, i.e. the Indian Ocean Rim Associa-",
  "tionforRegionalCo-operation(IOR-ARC)andIndianOceanNavalSymposium(IONS),the",
  "Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIM-",
  "STEC\u2014formerly Bangladesh, India, Sri Lanka, Thailand Economic Cooperation), East Asian",
  "Summit (EAS) and Asia-Paci\ufb01c Economic Cooperation (APEC). All of these involve India\u2019s",
  "sense and rede\ufb01ning of \u2018regions\u2019, and throw into question varying levels of integration. The",
  "words of Peter Jay come to mind, that \u2018good regionalism is good geopolitics; and bad region-",
  "alism is bad geopolitics\u2019.1 Such questions and shifts within India\u2019s sense of \u2018region\u2019 and region-",

  "regionalism for India have been subject to construction and reshaping, the domain of Interna-",
  "tional Relations (IR) constructivism.",
  "South Asia (and SAARC)",
  "India\u2019s clearest regional setting is within the subcontinent of South Asia, and its vehicle for",
  "regional integration is SAARC. If South Asia is de\ufb01ned geographically as the region bounded",
  "by the Hindu Kush-Himalayas on land and the Indian Ocean open waters, then India is",
  "immediately at the very heart of this area. It is no coincidence that the Indian subcontinent is",
  "called the \u2018Indian\u2019 subcontinent. The question for India is how far that physical suggestion and",
  "geopolitical potential gets translated into actual geopolitical power actuality. The term \u2018hege-",
  "mon\u2019 tends to have unattractive connotations, yet India\u2019s weight remains evident. If we take",
  "South Asia in the above geographical (Hindu Kush-Himalayas\u2013Indian Ocean boundaries) or",
  "political (membership of SAARC), then India looms large. In terms of geography, India covers",

  "around 75% of the landmass and the population of South Asia. In terms of location it has cen-",
  "trality: whilst it has borders with Pakistan, Nepal, Bhutan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, they do",
  "not have borders with each other. Consequently, relations within South Asia tend to be India-",
  "centred, be it positive or negative, with other bilateral relations between South Asian states",
  "being much less evident, in comparison. This gives India clear regional advantages, yet it also",
  "gives it regional disadvantages as smaller states either try to obstruct India, balance against India,",
  "seek to counterbalance with other South Asian states against India, or seek countervailing",
  "external(e.g.thePeople\u2019sRepublicofChina)helpfromoutsidetheregion.India\u2019sownactions",
  "towards South Asia have gone through three phases, and have led to the creation and progres-",
  "sion of SAARC.",
  "Initially, India\u2019s involvement with South Asia was limited, indeed neglected. India\u2019s relations",
  "withPakistanwereimportant,buthighlynegative.Instead,JawaharlalNehru,India\u2019s\ufb01rstPrime",
  "Minister (1947\u201364), who was also Minister of External A\ufb00airs, pursued a path of engagement",
  "with the world, a foreign policy that stressed morality and ethics, and which concerned itself",
  "with global issues like non-alignment and global nuclear disarmament. Nehru\u2019s involvement in",
  "South Asia was limited to establishing Indian treaty consolidation in the Himalayas, with",
  "Bhutan (1949), Sikkim (1950) and Nepal (1950); treaties which left a degree of Indian pre-",
  "eminence existing there in varying degrees, even whilst India\u2019s \u2018Forward Rights\u2019 inherited in",
  "Tibet were being lost to a resurgent China. Having consolidated a local Himalayan pre-emi-",
  "nence, Nehru tended to pursue a fairly limited involvement there, a degree of neglect. Sri",
  "Lanka was also neglected by India, as were the Maldives. Pakistan remained the bitter foe",
  "whose religious principles of national formation in 1947 had cut across Indian secular-geo-",
  "graphical principles of national formation, the foe who had an ongoing territorial dispute with",
  "IndiaovertheprovinceofKashmir,andthefoewithwhomIndiawenttothe\ufb01rstofitsseveral",
  "wars in 1949. The only sign of co-operation there was at a functional level with the Indus",
  "Waters Treaty of 1961. India\u2019s relations in South Asia remained bilateral, with no regional",
  "mechanisms in place for integration. As for regional integration, there had been some desultory",
  "conversations of it at the Asian Relations Conference in New Delhi in April 1947, the Baguio",
  "Conference in the Philippines in May 1950, and the Colombo Powers Conference in April",
  "1954, but nothing came of them. Instead, the region settled down to ongoing India\u2013Pakistan",
  "friction",
  "Interestingly enough the most evident sign of India exerting itself in South Asia was with its",
  "forcible occupation of the Portuguese enclave of Goa, which was \u2018liberated\u2019 in 1961. The",
  "arguments used by Nehru were ones that seemed to give a pre-eminence to India, with Nehru",
  "invokingtheearlierMonroeDoctrinetoevokehisowndoctrine,dubbedtheNehruDoctrine:",
  "The famous declaration by President Monroe of the United States [that] any interference",
  "by a European country would be an interference with the American political system. I",
  "submit that [\u2026] the Portuguese retention of Goa is a continuing interference with the",
  "political system established in India today. I shall go a step further and say that any inter-",

  "is that any attempt by a foreign power to interfere in any way with India is a thing which",
  "Indiacannottolerate,andwhich,subjecttoherstrength,shewilloppose.Thatisthebroad",
  "doctrine I lay down.2",
  "Unfortunately for Nehru\u2019s assumptions, India\u2019s strength may have been enough to eject Por-",
  "tugal from Goa, under the Nehru Doctrine, but it was not enough to stop China\u2019s growing",

  "were to draw hard lessons from this.",
  "Nehrudiedin 1964, feeling bitterlybetrayed bywhathe sawasChinese treachery. Afterthe",
  "short transition premiership of Lal Bahadur Shastri (1964\u201366), Nehru\u2019s daughter Indira Gandhi",
  "took over as leader of the Congress Party. During her time in politics she served as Prime",
  "Minister (1966\u201377, 1980\u201384), before her assassination at the hands of disgruntled Sikhs,",
  "whereupon her son Rajiv Gandhi took over as Congress leader and Prime Minister (1984\u201389),",
  "before his assassination at the hands of disgruntled Tamils. Indira Gandhi changed the focus of",
  "Indian foreign policy and its security focus. Instead of Nehru\u2019s neglect of South Asia and focus",
  "on globalist soft power morality, Indira Gandhi concentrated much more on South Asia and",
  "focusedonanIRrealism-hardpower-realpolitik.Politically,Nehru\u2019semphasisontheNon-Aligned",
  "Movement (NAM) gave way to Indira Gandhi\u2019s much closer relationship with the USSR, sig-",
  "nalled by their 1971 Treaty of Peace, Friendship and Co-operation. Militarily, Nehru\u2019s relative",
  "neglect of India\u2019s armed forces gave way to a building up of India\u2019s military might. As such,",
  "\u2018bilateralism became the guiding principle of Indian foreign policy\u2019, rather than the shaping of",
  "any regional/multilateral structures for, and in, South Asia.3",
  "Security-wise, this South Asia focus of Indira Gandhi was underpinned by what came to be",
  "dubbed the Indira Doctrine, whereby outside intervention in South Asian a\ufb00airs was to be",
  "averted, \u2018the principle became a matter of faith for Indian foreign policymakers\u2019.4 It had two",
  "important planks:",
  "India will not tolerate external intervention in a con\ufb02ict situation in any South Asian",
  "country, if that intervention has any implicit or explicit anti-Indian implication. No South",
  "Asian government must therefore ask for military assistance with an anti-Indian bias from",
  "any country. If a South Asian country genuinely needs external help to deal with a serious",
  "internal con\ufb02ict situation, or with an intolerable threat to a government legitimately",
  "established, it should ask help from a number of neighboring countries including India.",
  "The exclusion of India from such a contingency will be considered to be an anti-Indian",
  "move on the part of the government concerned.5",
  "Instead, local bilateral solutions were to be sought, in e\ufb00ect with India\u2019s involvement and",
  "indeedleadership,andbasedonIndian\u2018perceptions\u2019ofwhetherornotananti-Indiabiaswasin",
  "play.",
  "Application of the Indira Doctrine was seen in 1971 when India\u2019s intervention in the",
  "attempted breakaway of East Pakistan by Bengali nationalists enabled the setting up of an",
  "independent Bangladesh, in the wake of a relatively short but decisive military decapitation of",
  "Pakistani military forces by India. The 1971 India\u2013Pakistan war transformed South Asian geo-",
  "politicsandleftIndiamorethaneverinapositionofhardpowermilitarysupremacyoveritsrival",
  "Pakistan, and in South Asia generally. Other examples of this relatively hard-nosed application",
  "of Indian power came with military intervention in the Sri Lankan civil war (1971).",
  "Paradoxes abounded thereon, though, with the Indira Doctrine. The \u2018contradictions\u2019",
  "between India\u2019s global policy and its regional approach were real.6 Thus, \u2018at the international",
  "level, India rejected the notions of balance of power and exclusive spheres of in\ufb02uence; within",
  "the region it clung to them\u2019.7 Consequently, \u2018India was strongly opposed to intervention by",
  "major powers in the internal a\ufb00airs of weaker ones, but within the subcontinent it had to per-",
  "form the function of a provider of security to smaller nations and their regimes\u2019.8 Whilst \u2018India",
  "was all for multilateralism at the global level, yet in the region it insisted on bilateralism\u2019, in",

  "Indiaandregionalintegration",
  "which India would have the advantage on account of its inherent size and weight.9 All in all,",
  "Raja Mohan pointed out that \u2018India seemed to move e\ufb00ortlessly between the roles of protestor",
  "atthegloballevelandthatofmanagerofthesecurityorderwithintheregion\u2019,sothatwhilst\u2018its",
  "ambassadors were relentless critics of the international system in the global fora, within the",
  "region its envoys were transformed into proconsuls and viceroys in neighbouring capitals\u2019.10",
  "Amidst such contradictions there was no room for any multilateral regionalism, no room for",
  "any South Asian regional integration structure, or organizational set-up, other than India\u2019s",
  "bilateral application of its own power advantages.",
  "Indira Gandhi\u2019s assassination in 1984 brought her son Rajiv into power and under him the",
  "Indira Doctrine (sometimes called the Rajiv Doctrine) remained intact: bilateral arrangements",
  "for the region, with India playing the lead role. Examples of this included his decision to dis-",
  "patch an Indian Peace-Keeping Force (IPKF) to Sri Lanka (1987\u201390); to send military forces to",
  "the Maldives in 1988 (Operation Cactus) to restore the toppled government to power; and to",
  "impose a trade embargo on a landlocked Nepal in 1989. However, a decade later and the",
  "question can be asked, why did India not go to Sri Lanka\u2019s rescue in May 2000 when the",
  "island\u2019sleadershipbeggedittointervenetosavenearly40,000soldierswhowereclosetobeing",
  "captured by the separatist Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE)? Devotta wondered if",
  "\u2018India\u2019s disinclination to get involved, even as Pakistan, China and Israel provided arms to Sri",
  "Lanka, raises the question of whether the country is still committed to the Indira Doctrine",
  "(which operates as India\u2019s equivalent of the United States\u2019 Monroe Doctrine in South Asia)\u2019, to",
  "which his argument was that \u2018domestic pressures, especially those emanating from Kashmir and",
  "the country\u2019s northeast, may have left India militarily overextended, especially during the late",
  "1990s,andtherebypreventedthecountryfrom\ufb02exingitsmilitarycapabilitiesintheregionasit",
  "did in the 1980s\u2019.11",
  "A di\ufb00erent regional framework was seen with the formation of SAARC in 1985. The",
  "impetus for this came from Bangladesh, but India accepted its formation. However, its role was",
  "low key.",
  "A change of direction in Indian policy towards South Asia was signalled by Inder Gujral",
  "(foreignministerandthenPrimeMinister),whoannouncedin1996whatcametobeknownas",
  "the Gujral Doctrine\u2014namely, that the \u2018Government\u2019s Neighbourhood Policy now stands on",
  "\ufb01ve basic principles: \ufb01rstly, with neighbours like Nepal, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Maldives and Sri",
  "Lanka, India does not ask for reciprocity but gives all it can in good faith and trust\u2019.12 What is,",
  "of course, interesting is that Pakistan was not included in this listing, their relationship remain-",
  "ing \u2018tormented\u2019 indeed, to use Gujral\u2019s own admittance.13",
  "In the light of this \u2018friendly, co-operative mould\u2019, the Indian Government responded posi-",
  "tively towards a strengthening of SAARC\u2019s role. Foreign secretary meetings began in 2002,",
  "with heads of government summits in 2004. The question arises, though, of how successful,",
  "and how important an avenue for Indian foreign policy SAARC has been? In many ways",
  "SAARC has been a disappointment. As one Indian commentator put it in 2010, \u2018whatever the",
  "o\ufb03cials may say, the fact remains that the record of the organisation has nothing concrete to",
  "boast of\u2019.14",
  "In terms of security SAARC has not involved itself in India\u2019s security issues, primarily the",
  "disputes with Pakistan over Kashmir. India remains keen to keep it as a bilateral issue between",
  "itself and Pakistan, to be resolved between them and not by any outside organization like",
  "SAARC (or indeed the UN): \u2018with or without SAARC India enjoys a central position in the",
  "economic and foreign policies of the neighbouring countries and conducts its relations bilat-",
  "erally. It has the geographical advantage to shape bilateral policy without involvement of any",
  "third country\u2019, or organization like SAARC.15 The other security issue, transnational terrorism,",

  "SuppressionofTerrorism(1997),butthefailureofstateslikePakistantolegislateinternallyonit",
  "has nulli\ufb01ed much of its \u2018regional\u2019 value for India.",
  "Meanwhile, SAARC\u2019s primary goal of fostering economic co-operation has not really",
  "worked. Intra-SAARC trade remains meagre. The seventh SAARC Summit meeting at Dhaka",
  "in 1993 saw the signing of the SAARC Preferential Trading Arrangement (SAPTA), with a",
  "South Asia Free Trade Agreement (SAFTA) signed at the 12th SAARC Summit in 2004. This",
  "SAFTA was to be implemented in 2006, but only in a gradual way, and with sensitive items",
  "exempted. SouthAsia\u2019sintra-regional tradeasashare oftotaltradehas continued tolimp along",
  "at around 5% in the 1980s and 1990s and into the present, with SAARC having made little",
  "statistical di\ufb00erence. Such continuing low \ufb01gures stand in contrast to EU intra-trade \ufb01gure of",
  "around 60% and ASEAN \ufb01gures of around 25%. In terms of India, SAARC remains marginal.",
  "Ratna and Sidhu summed it up in 2008 as \u2018putting it another way India\u2019s trade with its",
  "immediate neighbourhood of SAARC India\u2019s trade with its neighbouring countries has not",
  "beenveryimpressive,bothintermsofvolumeandasapercentageofitsglobaltrade\u2019.16Having",
  "takenanalreadylow3.52%shareofIndia\u2019stradein2003/04,itdeclinedstillfurthertoa2.83%",
  "share by 2007/08. For 2009/10 SAARC accounted for 4.69% of India\u2019s exports, and an even",
  "more lowly 0.57% of its exports.",
  "Not surprisingly, Indian commentators can be dismissive of SAARC: \u2018regional interactions",
  "both in terms of movement of human beings or of goods, is minimum. Whatever success there",
  "may be in terms of economic exchange is perhaps not because of SAARC but despite it\u2019.17",
  "India\u2019sleadershipseemswellawareoftheseSAARClimitations.NatwarSingh,foreignminister",
  "in 2004, felt that:",
  "Many pessimists woulddismiss SAARCasa talkingshopwhose prioritiesare allmixedup.",
  "Detractors will point to the vast di\ufb00erences in geographical size, economic indicators, and",
  "diversity of economic and political systems as hurdles to integration. They would not be",
  "entirely wrong. SAARCwill be20 years oldnext year. It should be inthe full maturity of",
  "its youth, ready to take on new challenges and directions. Yet, in fact it has yet to con-",
  "solidate asan organization. At the recent SAARC meetingin Islamabad, wemade a strong",
  "statement that it was time that SAARC departs from its endless round of meetings, semi-",

  "AchangeofgovernmentbroughtlittlealterationtothisanalysisofSAARC\u2019sfailure,andothers\u2019",
  "success. Manmohan Singh\u2019s sense of SAARC has been damning enough: \u2018it is however a fact",
  "that South Asia has not moved as fast as we all would have wished. We have only to see the",
  "rapid integration within ASEAN and its emergence as an important economic bloc in Asia to",
  "understand the opportunities that beckon\u2019.19 The only trouble is that such sentiments suggest a",
  "readiness for India to look elsewhere for success, to other regions as it were.",
  "A further problem with SAARC has been political, that is to say, China\u2019s involvement with",
  "it. Here China\u2019s push for \u2018observer\u2019 status was initially resisted by India, but eventually was",
  "conceded in 2005, in the wake of pressures from other SAARC members for such an arrange-",
  "ment, and as a trade-o\ufb00 for acceptance of a (pro-India) Afghanistan as a full member. Never-",
  "theless, some commentators saw China\u2019s presence in SAARC as a (negative) extra-regional",

  "One sign of this is a nudge from the region being considered as \u2018South Asia\u2019 or the region",

  "geographical limits of its strategic neighbourhood to include states outside the SAARC area\u2019.23",
  "Not only strategic commentators, but India\u2019s politicians have been quite deliberately expanding",
  "the sense of what India\u2019s region actually involves:",
  "Our engagement with our neighbours is, as I am sure you realize, multi-pronged. It is at",
  "the same time conducted bilaterally, regionally under the ambit of SAARC, and through",
  "what one might call sub-regional or even trans-regional mechanisms such as BIMSTEC,",
  "which includes some SAARC members and some ASEAN ones, or IOR-ARC, which",
  "pulls together 18 countries whose shores are washed by the Indian Ocean, including some",
  "South Asian nations and several on other continents.24",
  "Accordingly, India\u2019s sense of \u2018region\u2019 within which it operates and shapes its foreign policy has",
  "shifted to include overlapping and wider areas, namely the Indian Ocean, the Bay of Bengal,",
  "and Paci\ufb01c Asia/East Asia, to which we can turn.",

  "The 1990s saw India embrace moves towards a wider regionalism, not focused on India\u2019s",

  "integral to any regional process pertaining to the Asia Paci\ufb01c. We have a constructive and",
  "multi-faceted relationship with every major country of the region. This is also true of",
  "India\u2019s relations with ASEAN\u2019s East Asian neighbours [\u2026] India\u2019s belonging to the Asia",
  "Paci\ufb01c community is a geographical fact and a political reality. It does not require formal",
  "membership of any regional organization for its recognition or sustenance.30",
  "With this in mind, India has forged membership links in various regional organizations in the",
  "western Paci\ufb01c/East Asia/Asia-Paci\ufb01c settings.",
  "Inpart, this has involved India in close linkswith the Association of Southeast Asian Nations",
  "(ASEAN), with which there is far greater trade, and with which India is a Dialogue Summit",
  "partner. This also involves India in membership of the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF), which",
  "links Paci\ufb01c Rim countries and India with ASEAN. Such linkages have pulled India into the",
  "emerging Asia-Paci\ufb01c, or rather Paci\ufb01c Asia/East Asia settings. India has been an observer",
  "member of the WPNS since 1998, and is currently seeking full membership. It has also had",

  "process, India is already privy to the inter-state a\ufb00airs of the Paci\ufb01c-bordering East Asia.",
  "APEC membership will be a logical follow-up, with potential bene\ufb01ts to both sides.31",
  "Currently India is seeking full membership of APEC, where the moratorium of expanding",
  "members ends in 2010.32",
  "Here, one important development within the Asia-Paci\ufb01c has been the move towards East",
  "Asian regionality, through the mechanism of the EAS, which \ufb01rst met in 2005. This is seen as",
  "the driving force for some sort of East Asian Community to evolve. India was keen to be",
  "involved, for which it received strong support from Japan but initial obstruction from China.",

  "Conclusions",
  "Old-fashioned politics seem to underpin much of India\u2019s role in regional integration. Within",
  "South Asia, SAARC remains a weak channel for regional integration. India\u2019s very strength, and",
  "sheer size, within South Asia and SAARC means that other states keep looking out of the",
  "region: \u2018most South Asian countries have actively perceived their main security threat to be",
  "India. Accordingly, South Asian states have actively sought military, economic and diplomatic",
  "assistance from external [extra-regional] powers to o\ufb00set India\u2019s in\ufb02uence. In such an environ-",
