  "Geopolitics arose in the 19th century, and throughout the 20th century it explained how the",
  "globalpowermapwasshaped.Powerequationswereformedbyimperialismintheearlypartof",
  "the century; by the East\u2013West divide and Cold War after the Second World War; and by the",
  "forces of globalization during the last decade of the century.1 Since the publication of the 1990",
  "article by Edward Luttwak, \u2018From Geopolitics to Geoeconomics\u2019, the term \u2018geoeconomics\u2019 has",
  "been used quite frequently by writers and policy-makers.2 It is explained as \u2018the intersection of",
  "economics and \ufb01nance with global political and security considerations\u2019.3 Earlier it was thought",
  "thatgeoeconomicsmightreplacegeopolitics,butnowitisacceptedthat\u2018geo-economicsrecasts",
  "rather than simply replaces geopolitical calculation\u2019.4 In other words, geoeconomics \u2018links the",
  "\u201cbig picture\u201d with the practical realm of markets\u2019.5",
  "Since the early 1990s India has been adapting itself simultaneously to the economic globali-",

  "policy and \u2018oil diplomacy\u2019 in search of new energy assets to ful\ufb01l the energy requirements ofits",
  "high economic growth, with energy security emerging as a \u2018crucial\u2019 component of its foreign",
  "policy.8 In a speech at the Constituent Assembly in December 1947, Jawaharlal Nehru had",
  "argued that in \u2018talking about foreign policies, the House must remember that these are not just",
  "empty struggles on a chess board. Behind them lie all manner of things. Ultimately foreign",
  "policy is the outcome of economic policy, and until India has properly evolved her economic",
  "policy, her foreign policy will be rather vague, rather inchoate, and will be groping\u2019.9 In",

  "to Indian policy-makers than any time in the recent past.10",

  "Changing economic engagements",
  "India is making a successful transition from an excessively inward-oriented economy to a more",
  "globally integrated economy. As a result of new policies in the early 1990s, it has become one",
  "of the fastest growing economies in the world. Despite some serious challenges, like energy",
  "security, poverty, infrastructure, regional disparities and internal security, there are strong indi-",
  "cations that rapid growth will continue. Notwithstanding global recession, the Indian economy",
  "continues to be one of the highest growing economies in the world. Due to increasing global",
  "linkages, the growth rate in 2008/09 came down to 6.7% from the average 8.8% achieved",
  "between 2003/04 and 2007/08, though recovering to 7.4% for 2009/10, and accelerating to",
  "8.8% in the second quarter of 2010. With US $185,000m. in exports, India\u2019s merchantable",
  "trade reached $490,000m. in 2008/09. It has been growing at an average annual rate of about",
  "26% in the last four years (between 2005/06 and 2008/09). In addition, the services sector,",
  "which accounts for about 55% of the Indian economy, continues to perform well and con-",
  "tribute to growing service exports, which touched $102,000m. in 2008/09. Within the services",
  "sector, IT and Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) industries have been growing quickly and",
  "were responsible for $50,000m. in exports of IT and related services.11",
  "Apart from expansion, the Indian economy is also becoming more diversi\ufb01ed. Traditionally,",
  "Western countries were main markets for Indian exports. In recent years signi\ufb01cant diversi\ufb01ca-",
  "tion has taken place. India\u2019s trade relations with the USA and the European Union (EU) may",
  "have increased in absolute terms, but relatively speaking as a percentage of India\u2019s total trade,",
  "trade with the EU and the USA has declined in the last decade. In comparison, there has been",
  "rapid integration of the Indian economy within Asia, which has been reinforced by India\u2019s",
  "\u2018Look East\u2019 policy, which was initiated in the early 1990s. This is clearly evident from the \ufb01g-",
  "uresofIndia-Chinatrade(averagetradegrowthwas53%peryearbetween2003/04and2007/",
  "08), as well as India-Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) trade. Studies have",
  "shown that India\u2019s qualitative and quantitative engagement with the Asian economies is far",
  "deeperthancommonlyperceived.12India\u2019seconomiclinkagewiththeWestAsiancountrieshas",
  "been traditionally quite strong, and more so now due to energy imports, a 2.5m. Indian dia-",
  "spora, and good trade relations.",
  "It is now becoming clear that along with the People\u2019s Republic of China and Japan, India",
  "would be playing an important role in an evolving Asian economic architecture. However,it is",
  "alsorealizedthatIndia\u2019srolewillbelesse\ufb00ectiveifitseconomicrelationswithinSouthAsiaand",
  "with the Central Asian region remain marginal. In this case, India needs to work for an eco-",
  "nomic policy framework, in which Pakistan, Afghanistan and the Central Asian republics view",
  "the partnership as bene\ufb01ting them too. This policy framework will also improve India\u2019s energy",
  "security as it may \ufb01nally get more substantive access to some of the energy resources in the",
  "Eurasian region. It can also fundamentally change India\u2019s sea-based continental trade.13 Indians",
  "can also \ufb01nd tremendous investment opportunities in Central Asia, which in turn can transform",
  "their small and medium industries as well as agriculture. The growing realization of these oppor-",
  "tunities has in\ufb02uenced policy-makers not just in India, but also in Pakistan and Afghanistan, as",
  "witnessed in Afghanistan\u2019s membershipofthe South AsianAssociation for Regional Cooperation",
  "(SAARC), the signing of the South Asian Free Trade Area (SAFTA), the Regional Economic",
  "Co-operation Conferences on Afghanistan, the emerging India-Kazakhstan partnership, the",
  "continuousinterestinTurkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India(TAPI)andIran-Pakistan-India",
  "(IPI) gas pipelines, and India\u2019s $1,300m. contribution to Afghanistan\u2019s reconstruction.",
  "In the early and mid-1990s, when the whole world was going for regional economic",
  "groupings, Indian policy-makers were concerned that India\u2019s major participation was only in",

  "SAARC, which was going nowhere. Under new policy initiatives, a major e\ufb00ort was made to",
  "move closer to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and gain membership of",
  "the Asia-Paci\ufb01c Economic Cooperation (APEC), in which India\u2019s objectives were both eco-",
  "nomic as well as foreign policy and strategic. After limited success with ASEAN, but frustration",
  "with APEC (where a moratorium on new members was put in place in 1997), India started",
  "looking for alternatives. It started developing other regional arrangements, speci\ufb01cally Indian",
  "Ocean Rim initiatives and arrangements with immediate neighbours in South Asia. E\ufb00orts",
  "made at various forums resulted in the establishment of the Indian Ocean Rim Association for",
  "Regional Co-operation (IOR-ARC) in 1997.14 Other major regional initiatives taken by India",
  "were the establishment of the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Eco-",
  "nomic Cooperation (BIMSTEC\u2014formerly Bangladesh, India, Sri Lanka, Thailand Economic",
  "Cooperation) and Ganga-Mekong Cooperation programme. In the late 1990s there were also",
  "discussions on establishing a growth quadrangle involving south-western China, north-eastern",
  "India, northern Myanmar and Bangladesh.15",
  "The collapse of the Doha development round of the World Trade Organization (WTO)",
  "negotiations pushed many countries, including India, to look for alternatives to multilateral",
  "negotiations to improve their trade positions. Since 2005 India has put its proposed regional",
  "trade agreements on the fast track. In the past, India had adopted a cautious approach to",
  "regionalism and was engaged in only a few bilateral/regional initiatives, mainly through Pre-",
  "ferentialTradeAgreements(PTAs)orthroughopenregionalism.16Inrecentyears,ithasstarted",
  "concluding Comprehensive Economic Co-operation Agreements (CECAs) with many coun-",
  "tries. The CECAs cover Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) in goods (which means a zero customs",
  "dutyregimewithina\ufb01xedtimeframeonitemscoveringsubstantialtrade,andarelativelysmall",
  "negative list of sensitive items with no or limited duty concessions), services, investment and",
  "other identi\ufb01ed areas of economic co-operation. India has already signed an agreement on a",
  "South Asian Free Trade Area (SAFTA) as well as individual trade agreements with Afghanistan,",
  "Bhutan, Sri Lanka and Nepal. The India-Singapore CECA, India-ASEAN FTA, India-Chile",
  "PTA,andanIndia-SouthernCommonMarket(MERCOSUR)PTAhavealsobeensigned.In",
  "addition, trade and investment deals are being negotiated with the Gulf Cooperation Council",
  "(GCC), the Republic of Korea (South Korea), Malaysia and Mauritius. India-EU and India-",
  "Japan negotiations are also at a very advanced stage. Similarly, India-Israel, India-Brazil, IBSA",
  "(India, Brazil, South Africa), and India-Russia joint study groups have been set up.",
  "Border trade",
  "So far the majority of India\u2019s trade has been conducted by sea. Border trade with China was",
  "stopped after the India\u2013China war in 1962. Similarly, very little o\ufb03cial trade happens by road",
  "withPakistan,BangladeshandMyanmar.Since1995somepositivedevelopmentsintheareaof",
  "border trade have taken place. Still, the policy initiatives were limited to a few border points",
  "with a small number of commodities exchanged by local communities living on both sides of",
  "the borders, mainly with Bangladesh and Myanmar. These initiatives were intended to stop the",
  "large amount of \u2018unauthorized trade\u2019 that was already taking place across borders in the north-",
  "eastern states.17 Encouraged by rapidly growing India-China trade, a limited opening has also",
  "been made through Nathu La pass in Sikkim. To give a new thrust to border trade, the Union",
  "Cabinet gave approval for the Land Ports Authority Bill in 2008.",
  "The new Land Ports Authority will oversee the construction, management and maintenance",
  "of integrated check posts (ICPs) on land borders; it will regulate the functioning of various",
  "agencies and co-ordinate several concerned ministries and departments. The ICPs will have the",

  "GulshanSachdeva",
  "regulatory agencies like immigration, customs and border security, as well as support facilities",
  "like banking and cargo terminals, hotels, etc. The Indian Government has approved the estab-",
  "lishment of 13 ICPs at borders with Bangladesh, Pakistan, Nepal, Bhutan and Myanmar over a",
  "period of three years. Of these, four ICPs will be set up in the \ufb01rst phase, at Petrapole (West",
  "Bengal), Moreh (Manipur), Raxaul (Bihar) and Attari (Punjab). If successful, this policy initia-",
  "tive has the potential to transform landlocked northern and north-eastern border regions of",
  "India.",
  "Energy security issues",
  "Theera ofhigheconomic growthinthe Westernworldbetween1945andthe\ufb01rstoilcrisisof",
  "1973 coincided with a period of cheap oil prices. The second oil crisis, triggered by the Iranian",
  "revolutionof1979,furthercomplicatedthesituation.Recentyearsofhigheconomicgrowthin",
  "countries like India and China have coincided with periods of increased oil price uncertainty.",

  "scrambled for a solution as high oil prices resulted in in\ufb02ation and threatened to undo the gains",
  "of high economic growth achieved in the previous two decades. Immediate \ufb01re-\ufb01ghting",
  "responses also exposed the weaknesses of a still developing national energy strategy.",
  "Just before the global economy went into recession, the US Energy Information Adminis-",
  "tration (EIA) projected that global energy consumption would increase by 50% from 2005 to",
  "2030. It was evident that emerging economies would account for much of this projected",
  "growth over the next 25 years. Among the emerging economies, the highest demand was",
  "expected to occur in Asia, particularly in China and India. Despite slowdowns in 2008 and",
  "2009,theireconomicprojectionsremainhighinthemedium-to-longterm.Duringthisperiod,",
  "fossil fuels (oil, natural gas and coal) will continue to supply much of the energy, with oil",
  "continuing to be important.",
  "Despite fairly low per capita energy consumption, India is the \ufb01fth largest energy consumer",
  "and is likely to become the third largest by 2030. The country is also a major producer and is",
  "currently the world\u2019s seventh largest producer of energy. Primary commercial energy demand",
  "grew almost three-fold at an annual rate of 6% between 1981 and 2001. To catch up with the",
  "rest of dynamic Asia and to remove poverty, it has become essential for India to continue",
  "growing at about 8%\u201310% or more over the next 25 years. Its energy requirements for a sus-",
  "tained 8%\u20139% annual growth rate pose a major challenge. According to the government inte-",
  "gratedenergypolicy,Indianeedstoincreaseitsprimaryenergysupplybythreetofourtimesits",
  "2004 levels, and its electricity generation capacity/supply by \ufb01ve to six times. With 2004 as the",

  "generationcapacitymustincreasetonearly800,000megawatts(MW)fromthe2004capacityof",
  "around 160,000 MW. In addition, the requirement of coal, the dominant fuel in India\u2019s mix,",
  "will also need to expand to 2,000m. tons a year.18",

  "GeoeconomicsandenergyforIndia",
  "Estimates show that India\u2019s energy consumption between 2007 and 2035 will grow at an",
  "average annual rate of 2.2%, with consumption of natural gas and nuclear energy averaging",
  "higher annual increases of 4.1% and 9.5 %, respectively.21 Since India is relatively poor in oil",
  "and gas resources, it has to depend on imports to meet its energy supplies. With already about",
  "80% of its crude oil requirements met by imports, its oil import bill was close to $90,000m. in",
  "2008/09. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) estimated",
  "that in 2005 India imported about 70% of its crude-oil requirements and consumed about 3%",
  "of world oil supply. Lique\ufb01ed Natural Gas (LNG) imports in 2005 made up 17% of total gas",
  "supply. India also imported about 12% of its coal supply.22",
  "The Indian economy relies heavily on coal, which also accounts for about 70% of its elec-",
  "tricity generation. After China and the USA, India is the world\u2019s third largest coal user. As a",
  "result of a government policy of diversifying the energy mix, the share of natural gas has",
  "increasedtojustover9%.Othersources,suchaswind,solarandnuclearpower,stillaccountfor",
  "very small shares. Although coal will still be a very important source of energy, the alternative",
  "policy scenario of the Government visualizes reduction in its demand by 2030. In the alter-",
  "native scenario, coal demand will grow much slower and oil demand will also decrease some-",
  "what due to the introduction of Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) and fuel e\ufb03ciency. Similarly,",
  "the role of nuclear power is envisaged to increase still further. Even if all these changes are",
  "implemented, India will still be importing between 29% and 59% of its total commercial pri-",
  "mary energy from outside. The latest government projections, in the Five Year Plan 2007\u201312,",
  "indicate that by 2030 India may be importing 90%\u201395% of its oil, one-half of its gas and one-",
  "third of its coal requirements.23 Although India has been a net oil importer since the 1970s,",
  "LNG imports started only in 2004.",
  "Currently, India imports oil from about 25 countries, with nearly two-thirds of imports",
  "coming from four countries: Saudi Arabia, Nigeria, Kuwait and Iran (see Table 5.1).",
  "Most analysts in India believe that the Middle East region (or West Asia as it is called in",
  "India) will remain the source of the overwhelming proportion of India\u2019s oil and gas imports,",
  "accounting for around two-thirds of Indian exports (Table 5.1). In addition, every oil shock in",
  "thisregionhashadanadverseimpactontheIndianeconomy.24Duetothisdependence,Indian",
  "policy-makers are worried about oil price volatility, and its impact on in\ufb02ation, economic",
  "growth and foreign exchange reserves. In addition, overwhelming dependence on the Gulf",
  "region has its own political implications. Compared with other major states in the world, India",
  "ismorevulnerabletoanydisruptioninoilsuppliesfromtheGulf.However,itcouldbeargued",
  "that India\u2019s dependence should not be seen as a vulnerability, as encouragement of growing",
  "interdependence between India and the Gulf contributes to stability to energy markets.",

  "As over one-half of the country\u2019s population does not have access to electricity or any other",
  "form of commercial energy, availability and access to energy is considered crucial for sustained",

  "Gas pipelines",
  "India is also exploring the possibility of importing gas through pipelines from Turkmenistan,",
  "Iran, Myanmar and Bangladesh. Since 2002 there has been a lot of discussion on the $7,600m.",
  "Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India (TAPI) gas pipeline. There have been some uncer-",
  "tainties over gas reserves in Turkmenistan, over the security situation in Afghanistan, and over",
  "the endemic strained relations between India and Pakistan. Still, all parties are considering the",
  "proposal very seriously. This 1,680-km pipeline would run from the Dauletabad gas \ufb01eld in",
  "Turkmenistan to Afghanistan, from where it would be constructed alongside the highway",
  "running from Herat to Kandahar, and then via Quetta and Multan in Pakistan. The \ufb01nal des-",
  "tination of the pipeline would be Fazilka in Indian Punjab. India was formally invited to join",
  "the project in 2006, having earlier participated as an observer.30",
  "The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has already proposed various structures of the pipeline",
  "for attracting investors, contractors and \ufb01nancial institutions. In 2006 Turkmenistan informed",
  "the members that an independent \ufb01rm, De Golyer & McNaughton, had con\ufb01rmed reserves of",
  "over2,300billioncumofgasattheDaulatabad\ufb01eld.Additionalreservesofabout1,200billion",
  "cu m are expected after drilling in the adjacent area. The gas production capacity of the \ufb01eld",
  "could be increased to about 125m. cu m per day (cu m/d) from the current 80m. cu m/d.",
  "Turkmenistan has committed to providing sovereign guarantees for long-term uninterrupted",
  "supplies to Pakistan and India.31 In May 2006 the Indian Government o\ufb03cially approved its",
  "participation in the TAPI project and authorized the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas to",
  "put up a formal request for joining the project. In April 2008 Afghanistan, India and Pakistan",
  "signed a Framework Agreement to buy gas from Turkmenistan.32 The participating countries",
  "also planned to discuss soon the issues of payments of transit to Afghanistan and Pakistan,",
  "taxation structure and consortium issues. For the last few years, TAPI has also been discussed at",
  "almost every important meeting on Afghanistan\u2019s reconstruction.",
  "Despite many obstacles, the $7,500m., 2,300-km Iran-Pakistan-India (IPI) gas pipeline is still",
  "ontheagenda.TheproposedIPIpipelinewillinitiallytransport60m.cumofIraniangasaday,",
  "split between India and Pakistan equally. In Pakistani territory an 800-km pipeline will be car-",
  "rying gas for both Pakistan and India. Iran and Pakistan have already \ufb01nalized gas sale agree-",
  "ments, withIrancommittingitselfto supplying21m.cumofnatural gasdailyto Pakistan from",
  "2014. In 2010 the Minister of External A\ufb00airs made a statement in the Indian parliament that",
  "India was still party to the IPI project and various issues concerning pricing of gas, delivery",
  "point of gas, project structure, assured supplies and security of the pipeline, transportation tari\ufb00s",
  "and transit fees for passage of natural gas through Pakistan, etc., were being discussed between",
  "participating countries. As in other parts of the world, the USA is also trying to inject its own",
  "geopolitical interests in the Asian energy competition. It has discouraged India from sourcing",
  "gas from Iran and instead promoted the TAPI pipeline.33 After more than a decade of engage-",
  "ment with these two pipeline proposals, it is becoming clear to Indian policy-makers that none",
  "of these two projects may take o\ufb00 in near future, as the security situation in Afghanistan and",
  "PakistanhasdeterioratedfurtherandIndia-Pakistanrelationshavenotimprovedeither.34Still,if",
  "any of these projects materializes in the near future, it will be a game changer in regional geo-",
  "politics and geoeconomics.",
  "A \ufb01nal pipeline project, importing gas from Myanmar, was also struck due to regional geo-",
  "politics. India and Myanmar signed a deal in 2006 to build a 900-km pipeline that would have",
  "crossed Bangladesh. Indecision from Bangladesh delayed the project and another pipeline pro-",
  "posal between Myanmar and China further complicated the matter. There were also reports of",
  "IndiaandMyanmar discussingalternative proposals linkingthepipeline directly withtheIndian",

  "Conclusions",
  "Atthisstageofeconomicmodernization,Indiaisadaptingtoeconomicglobalizationandtothe",
  "emerging Asian and global balance of power. Its accelerated economic performance has",
  "impacted upon its foreign policy in general, and on its engagement within Asia and with great",
  "powers. It is aggressively pursuing regional trade arrangements and also has started policy",
  "reformstoimprovebordertrade.ForIndia,developmentwithinthelasttwodecadeshasshown",
  "that geoeconomics has not replaced geopolitics. However, potential new economic opportu-",
  "nities, if realized, may in\ufb02uence regional geopolitics. India is vulnerable due to its insu\ufb03cient",
  "energy resources. Accelerated growth has also forced India to synchronize its energy security",
  "issues within its foreign and security policy. In the coming years, actions and commitments on",
  "the energy front will shape India\u2019s relations with countries like the USA, Russia, China and",
  "Iran. In the past, external energy policy meant securing reliable supplies from the Gulf. More",
  "recently it included multiple strategies of diversi\ufb01cation, acquiring assets abroad and pipeline",
  "politics. In future, protecting supplies from di\ufb00erent sources as well as assets abroad will also",
  "become part of national security. Despite all ambitious e\ufb00orts, coal will continue to be India\u2019s",
  "main energy source and the Gulf region will continue to be its main source of oil and gas. In",
  "the domestic front, we can witness major policy changes in the area of coal production, with",
  "private-sector participation, power sector reforms, rationalization of fuel prices, e\ufb00orts in the",
  "direction of energy e\ufb03ciency and demand management. It is also expected that nuclear and",
  "hydro-electric power as well as renewables will be playing a relatively bigger role. Therefore,",
  "the major action will be in the creation of a legal and institutional framework to implement all",
  "these policies.",
