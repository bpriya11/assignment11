  "Introduction",
  "Begum Khaleda Zia\u2019s \ufb01rst visit to India came in March 2006, only at the end of her term as",
  "Prime Minister of Bangladesh, and head of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP)-led",
  "administration.AvisittoIndia\u2014Bangladesh\u2019smostimportantneighbour\u2014wasprobablyviewed",
  "as either unnecessary or too problematic, resulting in it being relegated to the very end of her",
  "tenure. In contrast, her successor, Sheikh Hasina Wajed, visited India in January 2010, just a",
  "year into her term as the nation\u2019s Prime Minister, in which overcoming formidable hurdles,",
  "Sheikh Hasina Wajed\u2019s Awami League had swept to a decisive electoral victory in December",
  "2008. New Delhi rolled out the red carpet to welcome Hasina as its \ufb01rst state guest of the",
  "decade, as talk was of the two countries looking to \u2018turn a corner\u2019 in their bilateral relations.1",
  "This tale of two visits is a re\ufb02ection of how India\u2019s relationship with Bangladesh, a relation-",
  "ship in search of meaning, seems to have become hostage to domestic political imperatives in",
  "Dhaka. It is ironic that this should happen to Indo-Bangladesh ties, given India\u2019s central role in",
  "helping to establish the independent state of Bangladesh and the close cultural a\ufb03nities, geo-",
  "graphic ties and ethnic linkages they share. However, friends are as temporary as enemies in",
  "international politics. Instead, it is a state\u2019s national interests that determine the contours of its",
  "foreignpolicy.InthecaseofIndiaandBangladesh,theseinterestshavebeendivergingforsome",
  "years now; theirs has been \u2018a relationship adrift\u2019, with a bilateral relationship highly susceptible",
  "to the domestic political narratives in New Delhi and Dhaka.2",
  "This chapter examines the factors that are shaping India-Bangladesh relations and argues that",
  "a host of structural and domestic political variables are pulling the two states in opposite direc-",

  "1971, the modern state of Bangladesh was part of a larger, non-contiguous Pakistan. It must be",
  "noted that Bangladeshis (then known as \u2018East Pakistanis\u2019) comprised a major part of the move-",
  "ment to establish the independent state of Pakistan in 1947. As a result, many of the grievances",
  "that resulted in the original Partition of 1947 remain a part of the collective historical memory",
  "of modern-day Bangladesh. However, India\u2019s role in establishing an independent Bangladesh in",
  "1971 meant that, at least for a few years, India enjoyed a privileged relationship with the new",
  "state.3India\u2019sassistancetorefugeesfromEastPakistan,aswellasitsreliefandreconstructionaid,",
  "went a long way toward setting the foundations of the new country. New Delhi, by pulling its",
  "troops out of Bangladesh quickly after the 1971 Indo\u2013Pakistani war, acknowledged the new",
  "state\u2019s sovereignty. India, not surprisingly, was also the \ufb01rst state to grant recognition to Ban-",
  "gladesh. In 1972 the two states signed a Treaty of Friendship and Peace for a term of 25 years,",
  "declaring that both sides would respect their mutual independence, sovereignty and territorial",
  "integrity while refraining from interfering in each other\u2019s internal a\ufb00airs.",
  "However, the assassination of Mujib-ur-Rahman in 1975 (Sheikh Hasina\u2019s husband) and the",
  "assumption of power by General Zia-ur-Rahman (Begum Khaleda Zia\u2019s husband) in 1977,",
  "disrupted the friendly enough evolution of India-Bangladesh ties. It did not take long for rela-",
  "tions to deteriorate as Bangladesh started moving away from the linguistic nationalism that had",
  "been the focal point of its national liberation from Pakistan. Instead, Islam became the new",
  "symbol and binding force of the emerging form of Bangladeshi national identity. From a four-",
  "pronged state policy of nationalism, democracy, secularism and socialism, Bangladesh began",
  "moving rapidly toward embracing Islamic ideology, which has been used by subsequent Ban-",
  "gladeshigovernments tolegitimatetheirrule.4Infact,India\u2019sattempttoemphasize itscommon",
  "ethnic and cultural a\ufb03nities with Bangladesh back\ufb01red as this supposedly threatened to dilute",
  "the status of hard-earned Bangladeshi national identity. Much like other states in South Asia,",
  "Bangladesh also started resenting India\u2019s overwhelming regional presence and India eventually",
  "became one of the central issues around which domestic politics in Bangladesh revolved.",
  "Opposing India became the most e\ufb00ective way of burnishing one\u2019s nationalist credentials in",
  "Bangladesh, and political parties made full use of this tactic, with the possible exception of the",
  "Awami League, Sheikh Mujib-ur-Rahman\u2019s party that was now led by his widow Sheikh",
  "Hasina Wajed.",
  "It has been correctly observed that bilateral relations have been characterized by belligerence",
  "and insensitivity on India\u2019s part, and oversensitivity and suspicion on the part of Bangladesh.5",
  "Despite this, both states recognized that they needed to co-operate in order to address mutual",
  "problems. Thus, India agreed in 1992 to grant Bangladesh a perpetual lease over the Tin",
  "Bigha corridor, covering an area of 1.5 hectares, which had long separated an enclave of",
  "Bangladeshi nationals from their homeland, in accordance with the promises of a pact signed",
  "between India and Bangladesh in 1974. This happened despite Indian concerns that the land",
  "had become a haven for illegal immigrants to cross over to India and was being used by ter-",
  "rorist groups to in\ufb01ltrate Indian territory. The return of Sheikh Hasina Wajed\u2019s Awami League",
  "to power in 1996\u20132001 saw the signing of the Ganges Water Sharing Treaty in 1996, valid",
  "for 30 years.",
  "The coming to power of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in 1998 in India was, though,",
  "viewed with suspicion in Bangladesh. Dhaka had concerns that certain sections of the Hindu",
  "nationalist BJP might desire to re-establish the \u2018sub-continental India\u2019 that existed during the",
  "British rule, including territories stretching from the Khyber Pass in the north-west to Chit-",
  "tagong in the east. Thus, the return to power in 2004 of the more \u2018secular\u2019 Congress Party-led",
  "United Progressive Alliance (UPA) was cautiously welcomed by Bangladesh, which sent its",
  "foreign minister to India immediately for a four-day visit as a special envoy of Prime Minister",

  "insulting. India\u2019s tieswithBangladesh touched their nadirunder theKhaleda Ziaadministration",
  "in Dhaka.",
  "Overcoming formidable constraints, Sheikh Hasina Wajed, daughter of Sheikh Mujib-ur-",
  "Rahman, led the Awami League to an absolute majority in the December 2008 elections, dis-",
  "placing the openly anti-India BNP. Since then, both sides have made attempts to address each",
  "other\u2019sconcerns,thoughitstillremainsunclearhowsigni\ufb01cantamerechangeinadministration",
  "is going to be in transforming India-Bangladesh ties. Each state still perceives that the issues",
  "most important to it are being taken lightly by the other side. The factors that inhibit better",
  "relations can be categorized into three broad types: structural, institutional and bilateral. Each",
  "will be discussed separately below.",
  "Structural: balancing India\u2019s predominance",
  "Bangladesh is surrounded on three sides by India along a 4,094-km land border. This results in",
  "neartotalgeographicaldominationbyIndiaexceptforthe193-kmlandborderthatBangladesh",
  "shares with Myanmar. India\u2019s overarching presence in South Asia, in fact, has been a cause for",
  "concern for all of its smaller neighbours. Bangladesh is no exception. For India, the struggle",
  "againstPakistanin1971wasastrategicimperative,inwhichIndiafurthermarginalizedPakistan",
  "bycuttingitinhalfwiththeemergence ofBangladesh.IndiamayhaveexpectedBangladeshto",
  "remain indebted to it for its role in assisting Bangladesh to achieve independence, but this did",
  "not happen. Structural constraints are the most important determinant of state behaviour in",
  "international politics and Bangladesh soon began \u2018balancing\u2019 against Indian preponderance in",
  "the region. Like other states in South Asia, Bangladesh has tried to counter India\u2019s regional",
  "hegemony through a variety of means.",
  "Bangladesh\u2019s relations with Pakistan in the years immediately after independence were",
  "severely strained for obvious reasons, but their ties eventually began to improve quite dramati-",
  "cally. A major impetus for this was the desire of both countries to balance India\u2019s power and",
  "in\ufb02uence in the region. In 1974 Pakistan and Bangladesh signed an accord to recognize each",
  "other and two years later established formal diplomatic relations. The two states have main-",
  "tained high-level contacts ever since. It has been correctly observed that popular fears of Indian",
  "domination in both countries outweighs any lingering animosity between them, resulting in",
  "closer Pakistan-Bangladesh ties.6 Thus Bangladesh started cultivating Pakistan in an e\ufb00ort to",
  "counterbalanceIndiabecauseitseesIndiaasitsmainpotentialthreat.Incontrast,India\u2019sforeign",
  "policy obsession with Pakistan has led it to ignore Bangladesh. There is some suspicion that",
  "Pakistani President General Pervez Musharraf used his 2003 visit to Bangladesh to forge covert",
  "militarytieswithDhakaandobtainauthorizationforPakistan\u2019spremierintelligenceagency,the",
  "Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), to operate from Bangladeshi territory.",
  "More signi\ufb01cant are Bangladesh\u2019s attempts to woo an extra-regional power, namely China,",
  "to prevent New Delhi from asserting regional supremacy in its relations with Dhaka\u2014some-",
  "thing for which other states in the region, including both Pakistan and Nepal, have also fre-",
  "quently used China. For its part, China has been quite willing to play this role because it not",
  "only enhances Beijing\u2019s in\ufb02uence in South Asia, but also keeps India bogged down in regional",
  "a\ufb00airs and hobbled in its e\ufb00orts to become a major global player.",

  "HarshV.Pant",
  "Since China and Bangladesh established ties in 1976, their bilateral relationship has grown",
  "steadily, culminating in the signing of a Defence Co-operation Agreement in 2002 that covers",
  "military training and defence production.7 China has also provided Bangladesh with substantial",
  "resourcestobolsteritscivilserviceandlawenforcementagencies.Thetwostateshavesignedan",
  "agreement on peaceful uses of nuclear energy in the \ufb01elds of medicine, agriculture and bio-",
  "technology. Energy-hungry China views Bangladesh\u2019s large natural gas reserves as a potential",
  "asset to be tapped. Much to India\u2019s discomfort, Bangladesh supports China\u2019s full entry into",
  "SAARC. China is also helping Bangladesh in the construction of a deep water port at Chit-",
  "tagong, further heightening Indian fears of \u2018encirclement\u2019.",
  "In this context, it is interesting to note the proposal to revive the Stilwell Road (also known",
  "as the \u2018Old Burma Road\u2019), which stretches from the Indian state of Assam through Bangladesh",
  "and Myanmar, extending all the way to Yunnan Province in southern China. In 1999 China,",
  "India,MyanmarandBangladeshallcametogetherinwhatisknownasthe\u2018KunmingInitiative\u2019",
  "to push this proposal forward, mainly because of the potential trade advantages that would",
  "derive from linking those countries to South-East Asia via a long land route.8 However, India",
  "has been reconsidering this proposal, fearing that it might give a \ufb01llip to insurgents in north-",
  "eastern India who receive support from Bangladesh and might also allow Chinese goods to",
  "potentially \ufb02ood Indian markets.",
  "Institutional: domestic politics and the \u2018other\u2019",
  "A nation\u2019s foreign policy is also a function of domestic political institutions. India has emerged",
  "as a major factor in domestic Bangladeshi politics. It would not be an exaggeration to say that,",
  "in many ways, India is the central issue around which Bangladeshi political parties de\ufb01ne their",
  "foreign policy agenda. This should not be a surprise given India\u2019s geographic, linguistic and",
  "cultural linkages to Bangladesh. Over the years political parties opposing the Awami League",
  "have tended to de\ufb01ne themselves in opposition to India, in e\ufb00ect portraying Awami League as",
  "India\u2019s\u2018stooge\u2019.Moreover,radicalIslamistgroupsinBangladeshhavetriedtobuttresstheirown",
  "\u2018Islamic identity\u2019 by attacking India.",
  "India realizes that it is perceived in Bangladesh as being close to the Awami League; conse-",
  "quently, New Delhi has made some e\ufb00orts to rectify this situation. When the BNP-led coali-",
  "tion of Begum Khaleda Zia assumed o\ufb03ce in 2001, Indian o\ufb03cials sent a special emissary to",
  "Dhaka to assure the new government that New Delhi had no political favourites in Bangladesh",
  "and that its internal a\ufb00airs were not India\u2019s concern. However, this failed to make any long-",
  "term impact on the new political alignment in Bangladesh. Some in India argue that India",
  "should separate its relationship with Bangladesh from the latter\u2019s domestic politics and pursue",
  "greaterengagement.9However,theharshrealityisthatpoliticalpartiesinBangladeshinvariably",

  "The army in Bangladesh has also made periodic forays into politics, further preventing",
  "democratic institutions from consolidating. General Zia-ur-Rahman seized power in 1975 in",
  "the turbulent aftermath of the massacre of ruling Awami League leaders including Sheikh",
  "Mujib-ur-Rahman (Sheikh Hasina Wajed\u2019s husband). To give his military regime increased",
  "legitimacy, Zia actively wooed domestic Islamist fundamentalists and the Islamic regimes of the",
  "Middle East. In essence, he transformed Bangladesh from a secular to an Islamic republic. This",
  "transformation continued under his successor, General Hussain Mohammed Ershad, who ruled",
  "from 1982 to 1990, thereby ensuring that the military held an entrenched position in Bangla-",
  "deshi politics. The army\u2019s role is less active today, but it still remains a powerful force with its",
  "owndeep-seatedinterests.ElementsinBangladesh\u2019sarmycontinuetoholdastronganti-Indian",

  "The inability of civilian state institutions to govern Bangladesh e\ufb00ectively has not only raised",
  "seriousconcernsaboutthefutureviabilityofdemocracytherebuthasalsounderminedrelations",
  "with India. In the immediate aftermath of the 2001 elections there were concerted attacks by",

  "the BNP.12 The emergence of Bangladesh as a \u2018weak state with fragile institutions\u2019 unable to",
  "tackle internal security and governance has also given rise to problems in India-Bangladesh",
  "relations on a whole range of issues.13",
  "Domestic politics in India have also played a role in shaping bilateral relations. The issue",
  "of illegal immigration (or in\ufb01ltration) into India from Bangladesh has been part of the BJP",
  "election manifesto for several years, while the other national political parties tend to avoid this",
  "sensitive issue in their agendas. When operating in opposition, Congress Party leaders often",
  "criticized the BJP foreign policy towards Bangladesh as being driven by sectarian purposes. In",
  "this view, the BJP\u2019s anti-Muslim posture in domestic politics largely shapes its antagonistic",
  "posture towards Bangladesh. For its part, the BJP has argued that Bangladesh maintains a lack-",
  "adaisical attitude on illegal migration and when dealing with anti-India elements within its",
  "borders. The BJP\u2019s aggressive foreign policy posture was often considered to be reckless and",
  "overbearing by other political parties. They argued that it does not behove a government to",
  "project Bangladesh as a bastion of Islamist fundamentalism when the BJP itself often callously",
  "tries topolarize Indian society oncommunallines forthe purposesof gaining domestic political",
  "mileage.",
  "In turn, the BJP, in opposition, has argued that the Congress-led UPA\u2019s policy towards",
  "Bangladesh and illegal immigration is driven by the need to appease minorities rather than",
  "India\u2019s own national interests.14 It has jumped upon the Indian Supreme Court\u2019s ruling that",
  "\u2018there can be no manner of doubt that the state of Assam is facing external aggression and",

  "Bilateral issues between India and Bangladesh",
  "Water concerns",
  "Bangladesh is heavily dependent on India for the \ufb02ow of water from the 54 rivers that the two",
  "countries share. Bangladesh has complained that its share of river waters, in comparison with",
  "India\u2019s, remains unfair. The construction by India of the Farakka Barrage\u2014a low dam in West",
  "Bengal Province designed to increase water supply in the Hoogli River\u2014was a major bone of",
  "contention between the two countries. India has built a feeder canal at Farakka where the",
  "Gangesdividesintotwobranches;thishasallowedIndiatocontrolthe\ufb02owofGangeswaterby",
  "re-channelling it on the Indian side of the river. This dispute was resolved in 1996 with the",
  "mutualsigningofa30-yearwater-sharingagreementfortheGanges.Thishappenedafterearlier",
  "short-term agreements had lapsed.",
  "However, di\ufb00erences between the two countries have re-emerged after India announced a",
  "plan to link 30 major international rivers in order to divert the \ufb02ow of water toward its own",
  "drought-prone regions. This has generated concern in Bangladesh about potential economic",
  "and environmental problems emanating from this plan, whereas India continues to insistthat its",
  "project to integrate the rivers will not harm Bangladeshi interests. India\u2019s project is currently",
  "aimed only at peninsular rivers and o\ufb03cials have indicated that Bangladesh would be consulted",
  "when northern rivers were to be interconnected. As the upper riparian state India clearly",
  "dominates the management of water resources. Dhaka\u2019s bigger grievance is that although a",
  "water-sharing accord exists for the Ganges, similar agreements are needed for the remaining 53",
  "shared rivers. O\ufb03cials in the capital assert that many rivers and canals have dried up because of",
  "India\u2019s denial of water to Bangladesh. During Sheikh Hasina\u2019s visit to New Delhi in January",
  "2010, the two sides decided to resolve the issue of the sharing of the waters of the river Teesta",
  "after Bangladesh agreed to joint hydrological observations. The construction by India of the",
  "Tipai-mukh Dam across the Barak river has also been addressed.",
  "Migration and its discontents",
  "Another kind of \ufb02ow has also become a serious bilateral issue: the stream of illegal Bangladeshi",
  "immigrants into India. India shares a border with Bangladesh running through the Indian states",
  "of West Bengal, Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura and Mizoram. This border is longer than the one",
  "that India shares with China. Indian o\ufb03cials have alleged that continued illegal immigration",
  "from Bangladesh has altered the demography of India\u2019s border areas resulting in ethnic imbal-",
  "ance, electoral irregularity, and loss of employment opportunities for Indian nationals.16 In fact,",
  "in the late 20th century the massive in\ufb02ux of refugees \ufb02eeing persecution in East Pakistan (as",
  "Bangladesh was known before independence) was one of the major reasons India assisted the",
  "Mukti Bahini guerrillas \ufb01ghting for liberation from Pakistan. According to some estimates",
  "around 15m.\u201320m. illegal immigrants from Bangladesh have crossed over to India over the last",
  "several decades.",
  "The north-eastern states in India are particularly vulnerable to population movement: less",
  "than 1% of the region\u2019s external boundaries are contiguous with the rest of India whereas 99%",
  "are international boundaries. Bangladesh has complained that the overwhelming numerical",
  "superiority of Indian security forces along their long common border has spurred the killing of",
  "innocent Bangladeshi nationals by India\u2019s paramilitary Border Security Force (BSF). According",

  "Indira Gandhi and Mujib-ur-Rahman has yet to be implemented, with 6.5 km of unmarked",
  "borderland in need of clear demarcation.",
  "Ine\ufb00ective border management has also emerged as a major irritant in India-Bangladesh",
  "relations because of concerns about smuggling, illegal immigration, tra\ufb03cking in women and",
  "children, and insurgency. India\u2019s plan to erect a 2,886-km fence along its border with Bangla-",
  "desh, with an additional 400 km in the state of Mizoram, is nearing completion. However,",
  "there is noevidence that fencing will be e\ufb00ective in checking in\ufb01ltration in the area, where for",
  "historical reasons there are around 57 Bangladeshi enclaves in Indian territory and around 111",
  "Indian enclaves inside Bangladesh. In many ways the border with Bangladesh is more di\ufb03cult",
  "for India to manage than the border with Pakistan. The Indian army has little presence on the",
  "eastern border which is patrolled almost exclusively by Indian paramilitary forces. New Delhi\u2019s",
  "concerns are not only about demographic changes but also about the security threat posed by",
  "anti-India radicals and insurgents who sneak in along with economically deprived Bangladeshi",
  "migrants.Asmentionedearlier,Indiandomesticpoliticsfurthercomplicatethisissue,makingan",

  "The rise of the Jamat-ul-Mujahideen in Bangladesh is a testament to the country\u2019s growing",
  "Islamist radicalization. As a consequence, Islam in Bangladesh\u2014which has traditionally been",

  "in the Middle East. Bangladesh is now viewed as a safe haven by jihadists, who use its friendly",
  "government and infrastructure to regroup and for training purposes. A number of recent ter-",
  "rorist attacks in India have been traced back to Bangladeshi nationals working on behalf of",
  "Harkat-ul-Jihad-al-Islami, which is suspected of being an al-Qaeda front and also has links with",
  "the Jaish-e-Mohammed and Lashkar-e-Taiba jihadist groups based in Pakistan. Harkat-ul-Jihad-al-",
  "Islami is now one of the fastest growing fundamentalist organizations in Bangladesh and has",
  "been designated a \u2018terrorist organization\u2019 by the US Government. Islamist radicals from across",
  "Asia, including India, Myanmar, Thailand, Indonesia, Afghanistan and the Philippines, have",
  "gravitated toward Bangladesh for military training and refuge from their home governments,",

  "Despite the fact that the international community, including India, has long been asking",

  "Jamat-ul-Mujahideen, Said-ur-Rahman, being \ufb01nally arrested in Dhaka on 26 May 2010 after a",

  "attacks on India and on the Indian establishments in Dhaka, which has e\ufb00ectively curtailed the",
  "ability of Pakistan to use Bangladesh as a springboard for terrorism against India.",
  "Weak economic ties",
  "The economic basis of bilateral ties between India and Bangladesh remains weak and lacks any",
  "constructive agenda, making it even more di\ufb03cultfor the two states to move forward on other",
  "issues. This is despite the fact that India and Bangladesh are members of both SAARC and the",
  "Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIM-",
  "STEC\u2014formerly Bangladesh, India, Sri Lanka, Thailand Economic Cooperation). The Indo-",
  "Bangladeshi Joint Working Group on Trade Issues was established in 2003 and has held regular",
  "meetings ever since. None the less, it has failed to re-orient economic ties between the two",
  "states in a meaningful way. Bilateral trade may have increased to $3,180m. (a 0.71% share of",
  "India\u2019s overall trade) by 2007/08, but it had slipped back to $2,810m. by 2008/09 and",
  "$2,690m. by 2009/10 (a 0.58% share). Illegal trade, amounting to about three-quarters of the",
  "regular trade, has been the bigger winner. India\u2019s e\ufb00orts to secure transit and trans-shipment",
  "facilities for accessing north-east states through the territory of Bangladesh have been rebu\ufb00ed",
  "by Dhaka.",
  "The BNP Government also reneged on its earlier commitment, via the tripartite agreement,",
  "for the transportation of natural gas from Myanmar to India via a pipeline running through",

  "experienced by traders on cross-border trade are minimized by trade facilitation measures.",
  "Dhaka has also been asking for unilateral tari\ufb00 concessions on select items of export interest",
  "to help reduce its trade de\ufb01cit with India. In contrast, India feels that Indian investments in",
  "Bangladesh, such as the one proposed by the Tatas, are another way of solving this problem.",
  "With India\u2019s economic growth at an all-time high, its investments in the region will increase in",
  "coming years and there is no reason for Bangladesh to exclude itself from a process that will",
  "bene\ufb01t it immensely. After all, Bangladesh is set to become the second largest economy in",

  "It is clear that the SAARC agenda\u2014including regional free trade, upgrading of the transport",

  "India is witnessing rising turmoil all around its borders and therefore a stable, moderate Ban-",
  "gladesh as a partner is in its long-term interest. Constructive Indo-Bangladeshi ties could be a",
  "major stabilizing factor for the South Asian region as a whole. The instability in Pakistan,",
