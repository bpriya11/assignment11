  "Introduction",
  "Of all India\u2019s relations, that with Pakistan has been the most problematic and highly charged,",
  "over the longest period of time, a relationship accurately described by Inder Gujral as a \u2018tor-",
  "mented\u2019one.1Suchhasbeenthisongoing,generallynegativerelationshipthatforeachcountry",
  "the other now looms large as something of an existential bogeyman, the \u2018Other\u2019. Even as India",
  "looks beyond South Asia in its international rise, relations with Pakistan continue to remain",
  "embeddedlikeathorninIndia\u2019sforeignpolicy,bothwithinitsimmediateneighbourhood,andalso",
  "in India\u2019s extended neighbourhood. An \u2018unending\u2019 tension and con\ufb02ict has characterized their",
  "relationship as neighbouring independent states.2",
  "An initial moment in time illustrates this well, namely the Simla Agreement, drawn up in",
  "July 1972 in the aftermath of yet another war between these two neighbours.3 This came a",
  "quarter of a century after their emergence as independent successor states to British India. The",
  "Agreement\u2019spreambleassertedthat\u2018TheGovernmentofIndiaandtheGovernmentofPakistan",
  "are resolved that the two countries put an end to the con\ufb02ict and confrontation that have",
  "hitherto marred their relations and work for the promotion of a friendly and harmonious rela-",
  "tionship and the establishment of durable peace in the subcontinent\u2019. To talk of con\ufb02ict and",
  "confrontation as having marred their relations was indeed accurate. Unfortunately, a friendly",
  "and harmonious relationship had failed to operate before 1972, but equally well has also failed",
  "to establish itself since 1972.",
  "Within the Simla Agreement some technical details were established over the return of",
  "Prisoners of War, but little else. It stated that \u2018the two countries are resolved to settle their",
  "di\ufb00erences by peaceful means through bilateral negotiations or by any other peaceful means",
  "mutually agreed upon between them\u2019. Their di\ufb00erences have not been resolved. The Simla",
  "Agreement talked of how \u2018the basic issues and causes of con\ufb02ict which have bedevilled the",
  "relations between the two countries for the last 25 years shall be resolved by peaceful means\u2019,",
  "but those basic issues and causes of con\ufb02ict still remain pretty intact, unresolved by peaceful or",
  "indeed non-peaceful means. Within that range of issues, the Agreement talked of working to",
  "bring about \u2018a \ufb01nal settlement of Jammu and Kashmir\u2019, but almost 40 years on, the issue of",
  "Kashmir remains a confrontational bone of contention between them.",

  "Meanwhile, the Simla Agreement talked of interim measures, of a practical modus vivendi:",
  "\u2018bothGovernmentswilltakeallstepswithintheirpowertopreventhostilepropagandadirected",
  "against each other\u2019, a still-born piece of rhetoric. The Agreement may have expressed the hope",
  "that \u2018pending the \ufb01nal settlement of any of the problems between the two countries, neither",
  "side shall unilaterally alter the situation and both shall prevent the organization, assistance or",
  "encouragement of any acts detrimental to the maintenance of peaceful and harmonious rela-",

  "The Simla Agreement talked of \u2018basic issues and causes of con\ufb02ict which have bedevilled the",
  "relations between the two countries for the last 25 years\u2019. These basic issues and causes of",
  "con\ufb02ict can be organized into the following: national identity, Kashmir, terrorism, strategic",

  "Three Pakistan levels are involved, the role of Pakistan\u2019s governments, the role of Pakistan\u2019s",
  "Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), and the role of Pakistan-based jihadist groups.",
  "National identity",
  "Oneoftheinterestingthingsininternationalrelationshasbeenthewayinwhichperceptionsof",
  "culture and identity have indeed returned to the front of international relations analysis.4 22",
  "February 1941 was a fateful day in the history of British India and for the future shape of the",
  "sub-continent. On that day the force of Muhammad Ali Jinnah\u2019s \u2018two-nation theory\u2019 took",
  "decisiveshapewiththe LahoreDeclaration, the formal callby theMuslimLeague forPartition:",
  "\u2018the areas in which the Muslims are numerically in majority as in the North-Western and",
  "Eastern zones of India should be grouped to constitute independent states in which the con-",
  "stituent units shall be autonomous and sovereign\u2019. In bald terms, this led to the creation of",
  "Pakistan, divided into two wings, West Pakistan and East Pakistan.",
  "The rationale for this was the two-nation theory propounded vigorously by Jinnah, whose",
  "forceful personality and determination played a key part in getting this, and hence being called",
  "the Quaid-I Azam \u2018Father of the Nation\u2019. In this case, his sense of nation was religiously based,",
  "even if his personal life was not, namely Islam.",
  "It is a dream that the Hindus and Muslims can ever evolve a common nationality and this",
  "misconceptionofoneIndiannationliesgonefarbeyondthelimitsandisthecauseofmost",
  "of your troubles and will lead India to destruction if we fail to revise our notions in time.",
  "The Hindus and Muslims belong to two di\ufb00erent religious philosophies, social customs,",
  "literatures. They neither inter-marry nor inter-dine together and, indeed, they belong to",
  "twodi\ufb00erentcivilizationswhicharebasedmainlyoncon\ufb02ictingideasandconceptions[\u2026]",
  "To yoke together two such nations under a single State, one as a numerical minority and",
  "the other as a majority, must lead to growing discontent and \ufb01nal destruction of any fabric",
  "that may be so built up for the government of such a state.5",
  "Samuel Huntington\u2019s Clash of Civilization thesis had indeed been predated in this analysis by",
  "Jinnah half a century earlier, a \u2018fractured fraternity\u2019 predating Huntington\u2019s \u2018fracture lines of",

  "the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, and the (secular) Republic of India.",
  "The irony is that Jinnah seemed to think that dividing India up on di\ufb00erent nation grounds",
  "would not damage subsequent inter-nation relations between two such diametrically created",
  "states:",
  "The problem in India is not of an inter-communal character but manifestly of an interna-",
  "tional one, and it must be treated as such [\u2026] There is no reason why these states should",
  "be antagonistic to secure to each other [\u2026] It will lead more towards natural good will by",

  "Minorities by reciprocal arrangements and adjustments between Muslim India and Hindu",
  "India, which will far more adequately and a\ufb00ectively safeguard the rights and interests of",
  "Muslims and various other Minorities.7",
  "However, this has most certainly not been the case. For over half a century these two neigh-",
  "bours emerging from British India have polarized the subcontinent and taken their arguments",
  "against each other inside and outside the region.",
  "Part of the legacy has been the reverberating e\ufb00ects of the political polemics surrounding",
  "Partition, and the very tangible human su\ufb00ering caused as Partition was implemented on the",
  "ground amidst population transfers and sectarian killings on a signi\ufb01cant scale during that",
  "summer of 1947. In terms of national psyche, this historical memory is still strong.",
  "Inaddition,thereis apoliticallegacy. Theproblem hasbeenthatthe politicalfoundations of",
  "the one challenge the very foundations and legitimacy of the other, through being based on",
  "diametrically opposite principles. On the one hand stands Pakistan, the very case for political",

  "religion, Pakistan made no sense, especially in its split geographical position between East and",
  "WestPakistan.Islamwastheideologicalglueusedtojustifyitsverynationalexistence,basedon",
  "the claim that Hindus and Muslims could not get along in a common national framework. On",
  "the other hand the Republic of India rejected the very foundations of the two-nation theory,",
  "refusing to see itself a Hindu India, it proclaimed and rejoiced in religious pluralism under-",
  "pinned by a secular political underpinning for the state and for a geographical sense of what",
  "India was. India\u2019s secular-political claims cut across and in a way continue to undermine Paki-",
  "stan\u2019s legitimacy, whilst Pakistan\u2019s religious-political claims cut across and in a way continue to",
  "undermine India\u2019s secular legitimacy. In e\ufb00ect, \u2018the underlying basis of the Indo-Pakistani",
  "con\ufb02ict is really an argument about the fundamentals of state-construction\u2019, an argument over",

  "Party (BJP\u2014Indian People\u2019s Party) 2004 manifesto was blunt in how \u2018the BJP un\ufb02inchingly",
  "holds that di\ufb00erences in faith cannot challenge the idea of India as One Nation or undermine",

  "Kashmir",
  "Kashmir is the fulcrum on which intangible matters of national formation have developed into",
  "tangible matters of international con\ufb02ict. In the months of Partition in 1947, generally Hindu-",
  "majority states went to India, and Muslim-majority states went to Pakistan. However, there",
  "were a few exceptions where local rulers did not re\ufb02ect the religious identity of their states. In",
  "the case of Junagadh, a coastal enclave, its Muslim ruler, advised by his adviser Shah Nawaz",
  "Bhutto, the father of Pakistan\u2019s later Prime Minister Zul\ufb01kar Bhutto, opted for Pakistan, but",
  "was swept away by a blockade, military intervention and successful plebiscite imposed by India.",
  "In the case of Hyderabad, totally surrounded by Indian territory, its Muslim ruler opted for",
  "independence before Indian troops intervened in September 1947.",
  "In the case of Kashmir the lines went the other way, with a Hindu ruler sitting atop a",
  "Muslim majority population. Further ambiguity was caused by strong independence sentiments",
  "being mu\ufb04ed, and with the majority Muslim opinion being re\ufb02ected not by Jinnah\u2019s Muslim",
  "League but by Sheikh Abdullah\u2019s National Conference that had co-operative links with the",
  "Congress Party. Su\ufb03ce to say that amidst temporization by the Kashmir ruler, growing",
  "instability and appearance of irregular forces from the Pakistan side, followed by the decision of",

  "central valley (Muslim-dominated) as well as Jammu (Hindu) and Ladakh (Buddhist), whilst",
  "Pakistan held onto the western fringes of Kashmir (renamed Azad Kashmir, \u2018Free Kashmir\u2019) and",
  "the northerly mountainous area of Baltistan. In the wake of military stalemate and recourse to",
  "the UN, vague promises were given on a plebiscite at some point, but this was shelved subse-",
  "quently, as Sheikh Abdullah lent support to Kashmir\u2019s accession to India, and Pakistan",
  "strengthened its grip on Azad Kashmir/Baltistan.",
  "Since then, con\ufb02ict, \u2018unending war\u2019, has raged, with indeterminate outcomes merely",
  "entrenching divided outlooks between the two neighbours.10 War in 1947\u201349 focused",
  "on Kashmir, whilst the wider con\ufb02icts in 1965 and 1971 brought in collateral \ufb01re in",
  "Kashmir. Within Kashmir the Kargil mini-war of 1999 was of course Kashmir-based, with",
  "the Siachin glacier proving another spot within Kashmir over which the two countries",
  "clashed. The Kargil dispute was the last time that the states employed their military forces",
  "directly against each other, but cross-\ufb01re along the Line of Control continues down to the",
  "present.",
  "Post-Kargil, Kashmir has not disappeared as an issue.11 Instead of state-to-state con\ufb02ict,",

  "instrument to substitute for the lack of strategic depth and early warning capabilities of a Paki-",
  "stan that had been truncated in two following the 1971 war with India. Internal Kashmir",
  "developments,includingthedeathofSheikhAbdullahin1982andharder-linecoercivepolicies",
  "by Indira Gandhi, had sparked a growing insurgency in the valley of Kashmir in 1989. In",
  "Pakistan the political leadership, now headed by Benazir Bhutto, gave political support to the",
  "Kashmir cause, whilst the ISI gave material and substantial support to the insurgent groups,",
  "funnelling aid across the cease\ufb01re Line of Control leading from Pakistan-controlled Azad",
  "Kasmir/Baltistan into the Indian-controlled valley of Kashmir.",
  "The results were clear enough, growing identi\ufb01cation and denunciation of Pakistan as a",
  "terrorist-sheltering state. Typical was India\u2019s Ministry of External A\ufb00airs Annual Report 1998\u2013",
  "1999:",
  "Our concerns regarding Pakistan\u2019s continued, and active involvement in instigating and",
  "sponsoring terrorism in J& K and other parts of India, were made clear to them on several",
  "occasions during the year \u2013 and reiterated during the composite dialogue, and conclusive",
  "evidence to this e\ufb00ect was also presented. It was emphasised that our resolve to defeat",
  "cross-border terrorism and to safeguard our security interests was total. We have advised",
  "them that abandonment of this activity, and full respect for their commitments under the",
  "Simla Agreement, including avoidance of provocative acts across the LOC and hostile",
  "propaganda, were essential steps.12",
  "Such Pakistan-sponsored support for insurgency groups was further strengthened by the ending",
  "of the ISI-supported mujahideen groups that had been operating against Soviet forces in Afgha-",
  "nistan. In the wake of the Soviet withdrawal, such Afghanistan-con\ufb02ict mujahideen veterans,",

  "groups aided and abetted by Pakistan\u2019s ISI.",
  "However a further problem for India has been the readiness of such Pakistan-sponsored",
  "groups to take the \ufb01ght to other parts of India. In 1993 \u2018Pakistan\u2019s complicity in the planning",

  "satisfactorily addresses this query is that Pakistan \u2013 a product of the indefensible Two",

  "What isstriking is therejection ofPakistan\u2019s veryfoundations, the two-nations theory, asbeing",
  "indefensible, not only then in Pakistan\u2019s 1947 formation, but also logically for its continuation",
  "in the 21st century. What is also noticeable is this sense of Pakistan dragging India down from",
  "its otherwise straightforward international rise.",
  "In 2008 it was the Mumbai bombings again. India was clear on the Pakistani provenance of",
  "the attackers:",
  "The more fragile a Government, the more it tends to act in an irresponsible fashion.",
  "Pakistan\u2019s responses to our various demarches on terrorist attacks is an obvious example",
  "[\u2026] Those in charge of the terrorist infrastructure in Pakistan have resorted to other stra-",

  "Karachi on November 26. The terrorist attack in Mumbai in November last year was",
  "clearly carried out by a Pakistan-based out\ufb01t, the Lashkar-e-Taiba. On the basis of the",
  "investigations carried out, including the Agencies of some foreign countries whose",
  "nationals were killed in the attack, there is enough evidence to show that, given the",
  "sophistication and military precision of the attack it must have had the support of some",
  "o\ufb03cial agencies in Pakistan.15",
  "Talk of \u2018some o\ufb03cial agencies in Pakistan\u2019 is another word for the ISI. What is noticeable is",

  "Strategic culture, the legacy of war and military arms race dynamics",
  "Amidst such ideological and territorial divides, Pakistan and India have come to blows several",
  "times. India may stress its ahimsa (non-violence) tradition, but it has been prepared to take the",
  "battle to Pakistan. With both claiming moral justi\ufb01cation over their respective causes, and with",
  "both claiming to have fought defensive wars against each other, the fact remains that con\ufb02ict",
  "has been endemic since independence in 1947. Just over a century has seen successive wars,",
  "namely full-scale con\ufb02icts in 1947\u201349, 1965 and 1971, the mini-war over Kargil in 1999,",
  "ongoing skirmishes over the inhospitable Siachin glacier, near-war in 2001\u201302 (Operation Pra-",
  "karam mobilization), and cross-\ufb01re border incidents which are a continuing fact of life.16 For",
  "eachcountry,theirmostobviousmilitaryenemyhasbeentheother;theyhavebecomeusedto",
  "thinking of the other as the military foe.",
  "Pakistan has long sought strategic parity with India, with a sense of cultural \u00e9lan compensat-",
  "ing for numeric inferiority, the feeling that \u2018one Pakistani soldier is equal to 10 Indian soldiers\u2019.",
  "India has long sought to establish superiority over Pakistan, militarily and diplomatically. Its",
  "Cold Start military doctrine, introduced in 2004, was \u2018aimed militarily at Pakistan and is o\ufb00en-",
  "sive-operations speci\ufb01c\u2019, involving rapid deployment forces able to strike into Pakistan and",
  "crush both the Pakistani Army and terrorist groups operating on Pakistani soil.17",
  "Given such adversarial mindsets, there has also been an ongoing arms race competition,",
  "within which classic IR \u2018security dilemma\u2019 dynamics operate as each tries to match and cap the",
  "other, in a spiral of spending and mistrust. From Pakistan\u2019s point of view, it has long sought",
  "military equipment from more powerful allies to enable competition with India. Initially such",

  "iority over Pakistan. Fighteraircraft have beenone aspect oftheir arms race, withIndia keenin",
  "recent years to see that US arms sales to India are not matched by similar sales to Pakistan.18",
  "Missiles have been another feature of this arms race and build-up. Pakistan\u2019s arsenal was",
  "steadily built up during 1989\u20132000 in terms of numbers and range. It consists of Hatf-I (60",
  "km\u201380 km range), Haft-II (aka Abdali), Hatf-III (aka Ghaznavi, 290 km range), Hatf-IV (aka",
  "Shaheen-I, 750 km range), Hatf-V (aka Ghauri, 1,500 km range and payload capacity of 700",
  "kg), Ghauri-II (2,300 km range), and Hatf-VI (2,500 km range). These are all India-centric in",
  "terms of range and purpose. Meanwhile, India\u2019s own missile programme has developed over",
  "the years, with its Integrated Guided Missile Development Programme (IGMDP) set up in",
  "1983. This has led to Prithvi-I (150 km range), Prithvi-II (250 km range), Prithvi-III (aka Dha-",
  "nush, 350 km range), Agni-I (700 km range), and Agni-II (2,000 km range). The Prithvi and",
  "Agni-I missiles are all Pakistan-centric, while the longer range of Agni-II gives it China- as well",
  "as Pakistan-centric purposes, with the subsequent longer range Agni-III missile being China-",
  "centric alone.",
  "TheincreasingrangebutalsoincreasingpayloadofPakistaniandIndianmissileshasalsobeen",
  "entwined with their nuclear weapons programme, which indeed provides the nuclear payload",
  "for such missiles. India\u2019s nuclear weapons programme was sparked by China\u2019s nuclear advances",
  "in the 1960s. The 1971 defeat with India, followed by India\u2019s own nuclear explosion in 1974",
  "(Pokhran-I, Operation Smiling Buddha) was the spur for Pakistan to develop its own nuclear",
  "weapons programme, to try to re-establish military-strategic parity.",
  "Such developments came to a head in 1998, when in April of that year Pakistan tested its",
  "most powerful missile to date, the Hatf-V (aka Ghauri) missile, with a 1,500 km range and",
  "payload capacity of 700 kg. India\u2019s response was immediate: the Pokhran-II, Operation Shakti,",

  "What, of course, is evident are the China-centric strands of the argument, as well as the",

  "Pakistan links with China",
  "One China-Pakistan irritant for India was the readiness of Pakistan to give up to China its",
  "claims to the Trans-Karakorum Tract (Shaksgam valley) in 1963. This was greeted with dismay",
  "by India, which of course claimed that the Shaksgam valley was part of India through India\u2019s",
  "wider claims to Kashmir. Further reports of Pakistan allowing entry of Chinese forces into",
  "Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, in Gilgit and Baltistan, were of concern to India in the summer of",
  "2010.22",
  "In wider terms, one problem that India faces with Pakistan is that it may on its own have an",
  "undoubted power advantage over Pakistan, the hopes of maintaining any strategic parity with",
  "India of which disappeared after defeat in the 1971 war and the division of Pakistan. Pakistan\u2019s",
  "response to its diminishing power position vis-\u00e0-vis India has been to develop its own nuclear",
  "weapons programme (with the assistance of China) and to strengthen its foreign policy align-",
  "mentwithChinaingeneral.Thisso-called\u2018all-weatherfriendship\u2019betweenPakistanandChina",

  "multiplier\u201d for Pakistan vis-\u00e0-vis India\u2019.23 New Delhi increasingly sees Pakistan as not so",
  "important in its own right, but as o\ufb00ering dangerous opportunities for China\u2019s attempt to",
  "encircle India, coming, as it were, down from the Himalayas, down the Indus to the Indian",
  "Ocean, in e\ufb00ect blocking India along its north-western \ufb02anks. China\u2019s links with Pakistan are",
  "also seen as threatening with the build-up of the deep water port of Gwadar, opened in 2008",
  "with Chinese funding, and o\ufb00ering berthing potential for a growing Chinese naval presence in",
  "the Indian Ocean. Pakistan\u2019s links with China do constrain India to some extent. This did not",
  "stop India from military action in 1971 (Bangladesh) and 1999 (Kargil), but the dangers of",
  "facing a two-front war against Pakistan and China did stop India from taking military action",

  "Conclusions",
  "AnyonespeculatingonIndian-Pakistani relationsfaces aquandary.The mosttangibleissuemay",
  "be resolvable, perhaps with a status quo partition along the current Line of Control, with soft",
  "borders and decentralization of power away from India and Pakistan. Something on those lines",
  "seemed to have \u2018almost\u2019 been agreed in 2004, before the fall from power of Pervez Musharraf.",
  "However, ideologically they remain poles apart, with an inherent readiness to assume the worst",
  "of each other and to seek to constrain the other country, in the case of Pakistan with the help",
  "of China. IR security dilemmas continue to operate between these two neighbours. Trade will",
  "probably grow, though, as after all their remaining low level of trade means there is sizeable",
  "potential for increased trade.29 However, India may well be focusing its economic interest",
  "elsewhere,eastwardstotheBayofBengal(BIMSTEC),South-EastAsia(ASEAN)andEastAsia",
  "(EAS) frameworks.",
  "Of course, the internal character of each state remains problematic. Pakistan faces two chal-",
  "lenges: one is to avoid the \u2018Talibanization of Pakistan\u2019, the scenario whereby rising Islamist",
  "forces take control of Pakistan (and its nuclear forces) ready to unleash jihadist cadres against",
  "India in Kashmir and elsewhere.30 This would be a nightmare scenario for New Delhi. The",
  "other challenge is surviving intact.31 Some Indian commentators see Pakistan as an inherently",
  "\ufb02awedcreation,andsomethingthatiseitherdoomedtoeventualre-absorptionbackintoastill-",
  "rising India, undoing Partition as it were. An alternative variant is the disintegration of Pakistan",
  "into constituent Baluchi, Pashtun, Sindhi and Punjabi parts, smaller units that would be unable",
  "to pose such a challenge to India as Pakistan has. The example of 1971 lies before Pakistan and",
  "India, the eruption of Bengali nationalism generating the creation (with Indian help) of Ban-",
  "gladesh,therebyundercuttingthewholelogicofthetwo-nationtheoryanditsunderpinningof",
  "Pakistan\u2019s continuing existence. Meanwhile, what of India?",
