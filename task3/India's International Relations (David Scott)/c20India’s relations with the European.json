  "Introduction",
  "India has a multi-dimensional relationship with the European Union (EU), its largest trading",
  "partner, a major source of foreign direct investment (FDI), a signi\ufb01cant donor, an important",
  "source of technology, and home to a large and in\ufb02uential Indian diaspora. India no longer",
  "regards the EU as a mere trading bloc, but as an increasingly important political actor in world",
  "politics with a growing pro\ufb01le and presence.",
  "Historical background",
  "India took little interest in the movement for European uni\ufb01cation during the \ufb01rst years of",
  "Indian independence. The European Economic Community (EEC), the predecessor to the EU",
  "set up in 1957 under the Treaty of Rome, was remote from Indian concerns. There were no",
  "statementsbytheIndianGovernmentoranyreferencestoitindebatesintheIndianparliament",
  "until the United Kingdom expressed its intention to apply for membership of the Common",
  "Market in 1961. The question of India\u2019s relations with the EEC then took on a new urgency,",
  "especially as it came at a time when India\u2019s balance of payments had deteriorated sharply.1",
  "Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru argued that the EEC would deepen Cold War divisions,",
  "widen the gap between the rich and poor countries, and weaken the Commonwealth of",
  "Nations.",
  "Nevertheless, India recognized the importance of the nascent EEC and was among the \ufb01rst",
  "developing countries to establish diplomatic relations in 1963. Indian e\ufb00orts to establish a new,",
  "post-colonial relationship with the Community proved a challenging task since apart from the",
  "\u2018associated\u2019 overseas countries and territories of the member states, the Treaty of Rome con-",
  "tainednoreferencestotherestoftheThirdWorld.Indianpolicy-makersdeploredthefactthat",
  "the EEC Council of Ministers made \u2018no conscious attempt\u2019 in the early years to evolve a",
  "development policy towards developing countries; instead the EEC was much too preoccupied",
  "with its internal problems, with negotiations for its enlargement, and therefore remained con-",
  "tent to follow a limited policy in the framework of old colonial relationships of its member",
  "states.2",

  "During the 1961\u201363 negotiations for the United Kingdom\u2019s entry, the EEC was compelled",
  "brie\ufb02y to envisage future arrangements between the enlarged EEC and Commonwealth",
  "developing countries. India sought an Association Agreement similar to the one that the Med-",
  "iterranean countries and the African, Caribbean and Paci\ufb01c (ACP) countries had concluded",
  "with the EEC. However, this was ruled out for \u2018non-associables\u2019 like India lest these conces-",
  "sions were extended to all developing countries.",
  "With the collapse of negotiations for the United Kingdom\u2019s entry into the EEC in January",
  "1963, India and the Commonwealth countries, the Times of India editorial observed, had \u2018every",
  "reason to thank God and de Gaulle\u2019 for the collapse of negotiations for the United Kingdom\u2019s",
  "entry in the Community in January 1963.3 It led to an abatement of the threat of disruption of",
  "Indo-British trade for some time, but the challenge of de\ufb01ning the EEC\u2019s relations with",
  "developing countries remained. Relations with other developing countries would continue to",
  "be governed by their Common Commercial Policy.",
  "For a decade (1963\u201373), Indian e\ufb00orts focused on securing better market access for India\u2019s",
  "major exports and alleviation of its chronic trade de\ufb01cit with the EEC, which was the largest it",
  "had amongst all its trading partners. This was dealt with on a product-by-product basis by the",
  "conclusion of annual agreements on the suspension, in whole or in part, of the customs duty.",
  "Though the EEC introduced the General System of Preferences (GSP) in 1971, India felt that",
  "the GSP was not structured to solve the speci\ufb01c problems created for India by its loss of pre-",
  "ferential access to the British market. Many of India\u2019s main exports, including jute, coir, cotton",
  "textiles and tobacco, were either excluded from the scheme or else subject to special",
  "arrangements.",
  "With the United Kingdom\u2019s admission into the EEC in 1973, the enlarged Community had",
  "to decide on the arrangements to be concluded with the developing countries of the Com-",
  "monwealth. The EEC was in no position to take on the burden of \ufb01nancial aid to countries as",
  "populous as India. Under the Joint Declaration of Intent, annexed to the United Kingdom\u2019s",
  "Treaty of Accession (1973), the EEC agreed to examine with the Asian Commonwealth",
  "countries \u2018such problems as may arise in the \ufb01eld of trade with a view to seek appropriate",
  "solutions\u2019. India was the \ufb01rst country to take advantage of this o\ufb00er. However, member states,",
  "even those with past colonial connections with India, had no real interest in alleviating India\u2019s",
  "di\ufb03culties. India was perceived as \u2018Britain\u2019s baby\u2019 and it was up to the British to act in its",
  "favour.4",
  "The agreement the EEC was initially o\ufb00ering India lacked even \u2018a core\u2019; it was \u2018all packa-",
  "ging\u2019.5 The EEC was reluctant to agree to any sweeping programme of economic, industrial",
  "and \ufb01nancial co-operation lest it open the door to a host of similar agreements with other",
  "developing Asian and Latin American countries. The \ufb01ve-year non-preferential Commercial",
  "Cooperation Agreement (CCA) that India eventually signed in 1973 was the result of the dip-",
  "lomatic acumen of K.B. Lall, the then Indian Ambassador to the EEC. The agreement con-",
  "tained no new tari\ufb00 concessions, but provided both a focus and a contractual basis for India-",
  "EEC relations. India was not particularly jubilant about the CCA; it felt that it was the best it",
  "couldgetunderthecircumstances.Nevertheless,theCCAconstitutedabigstepforwardbythe",
  "EEC and set the pattern for similar agreements with other South Asian countries. However,",
  "conscious development of trade opportunities for India continued to be assigned only \u2018a low",
  "priority\u2019.6 Nevertheless, a series of useful trade development and trade promotion programmes",
  "were launched, and an expert study was commissioned to identify shortcomings and recom-",
  "mend ways to overcome them.",
  "After the conclusion of the 1973 CCA, India repeatedly urged the EEC to work out a new",
  "\u2018doctrine\u2019 covering the EEC\u2019s overall relationship with India rather than tackling matters each",

  "The 1990s",
  "With the end of the Cold War, the EEC (which became the EU in 1993) no longer had to",
  "look at India through the lens of Cold War equations. Moreover, India was becoming pro-",
  "gressively more interesting. Its policy of liberalization and economic reforms launched in 1991",
  "with consistently high growth rates, acquisition of nuclear weapons in 1998, and steadily",
  "improving relations with the USA,all ledto recognition of India asa potential global player by",
  "the EU. In the post-Cold War era India pursued a pragmatic foreign policy, shed most of the",

  "generation\u2019 agreement on Partnership and Development was signed on 20 December 1993 to",
  "encompass economic, technological and cultural co-operation, development and investment.",
  "The Joint Statement on Political Dialogue (1994) sought to achieve \u2018a closer and upgraded",
  "relationship\u2019, and expressed the resolve of India and the EU to reinforce and intensify their",
  "mutual relations in the political, economic, technological and cultural \ufb01elds. The European",
  "Commission pushed for stronger links in its Communication on EU-India Enhanced Partner-",
  "ship (1996).7",
  "The institutional architecture between India and the EU is now quite multilayered. Apart",
  "from the Joint Commission and Sub-Commissions, troika ministerial meetings have been held",
  "since 1982. Other institutional mechanisms include Senior O\ufb03cials Meetings, meetings",
  "between the European Commission and Indian planners, bilateral meetings in the margins of",
  "multilateral forums, working groups of specialists (on subjects like export controls, terrorism",
  "experts and consular a\ufb00airs), the India-EU Round Table, the India-EU Energy Panel and its",
  "working groups, their Security Dialogue, macro-economic dialogue on \ufb01nancial co-operation,",
  "a dialogue on human rights, and a science and technology steering committee. Annual summits",
  "have taken place since 2000.8 Parliamentary exchanges began with the setting up of a South",
  "Asia Delegation in the European Parliament. A separate India Delegation was established in",
  "September 2009 to re\ufb02ect the strategic partnership. The Indian parliament also set up a 22-",

  "\u2018Strategic partnership\u2019",
  "TheJoint Declaration of the \ufb01rst India-EU summit (June 2000) resolved that the EU andIndia",
  "should build \u2018a new strategic partnership\u2019 in the 21st century, founded on shared values and",
  "aspirations. The European Commission\u2019s Communication, An EU-India Strategic Partnership",
  "(June 2004), proposed to develop a strategic partnership with India in four key areas: a) co-",
  "operation, especially in multilateral forums, on con\ufb02ict prevention, the \ufb01ght against terrorism",
  "and non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction; b) strengthened economic partnership",
  "through strategic policy and sectoral dialogues; c) development co-operation; and d) fostering",
  "intellectual and cultural exchanges.10 A 46-page Commission Sta\ufb00 Working Document",
  "annexed to the Communication proposed over 100 actionable points in various sectors, the",
  "great majority of which concerned trade and commerce. In its \ufb01rst-ever strategy paper on",
  "relations with an outside entity, India responded with a detailed 31-page response to the",
  "Commission\u2019s Communication.11 The \u2018strategic partnership\u2019 (upgraded) relationship was speci-",
  "\ufb01cally endorsed at the \ufb01fth India-EU summit in 2004. There seemed a sense between them by",

  "There are fundamental di\ufb00erences between India and the EU on many issues because they are",
  "at di\ufb00erent levels of development, because they come from two di\ufb00erent milieux, and because",
  "they have di\ufb00erent geographical and geopolitical priorities. Indian perspectives are shaped by its",
  "historical experiences and current realities, which include the fact that it lives in a very di\ufb03cult",
  "and dangerous neighbourhood surrounded by failed or failing states, and confronts a variety of",

  "many \ufb01elds, including trade, development, climate change, the International Criminal Court,",
  "globalization, humanitarian intervention, etc. On most issues that matter to India, like enlarge-",
  "ment of the UN Security Council and civilian nuclear energy, the EU either has no common",
  "policy or is unable to formulate one. Though the EU and India have shared objectives in most",
  "South Asian countries, they are often unable to calibrate their foreign policies to work there.",
  "India feels that the EU is a marginal player when it comes to the security milieu in South Asia.",
  "India does not seek to replace, but democratize, existing structures of global governance and",
  "increase its role in decision-making. India has been consistently advocating a more democra-",
  "tized, more representative and more credible UN system and has sought membership as a per-",
  "manent member of a reformed UN Security Council. To most stakeholders in India, Europe is",
  "clearly over-represented but is in no hurry to reduce such over-representation. Most of the",
  "existing \ufb01nancial and trade rules of the current international architecture re\ufb02ect the power rea-",

  "years, there is a basic and increasing contestation about the content, value and scope of norms",
  "between the developed and developing countries. Europe often presents the normative agenda",
  "in a way that seeks to undermine the competitive advantage of developing countries. India",
  "wants to play a greater role in the making of new rules of the international economic and",
  "\ufb01nancial system.",
  "Nevertheless, on most issues of substance, India\u2019s broad interests as a rising major power are",
  "consonant with those of the other major powers. In the military-political arena, India shares a",

  "held in New Delhi; instead the EU delegation was led by the German Ambassador to India.",
  "Another new forum for India to further develop its growing relations with both Asia and",
  "Europe is the 45-member Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM), which New Delhi joined in 2007",
  "and in which the EU\u2019s European Commission is one of the co-ordinators.",
  "Combating terrorism and security dialogue",
  "A victim of terrorism since 1980, Indian o\ufb03cials had for years stressed the need for a frank and",
  "honest dialogue with the EU on terrorism. Despite recognition by the EU and its member",
  "states\u2019 dislike for Pakistani adventurism in Kargil (1999), Europe was not willing to confront",
  "Pakistan on its \u2018sponsorship\u2019 of cross-border terrorism. During the \ufb01rst India-EU summit (June",
  "2000), Brussels resisted attempts by India to bring terrorism onto the agenda on the grounds",
  "that it was an issue best left to direct talks between India and individual member states of the",
  "Union. Brussels also didnot share Indian characterizations of Pakistan as either a \u2018failedstate\u2019 or",
  "an \u2018epicentre of terrorism\u2019.",
  "After the terrorist attacks on the USA on 11 September 2001, the EU itself accepted that",
  "terrorism had to be henceforth among the topics of discussion and since then the topic has",
  "\ufb01gured at each summit. Both sides continue to share concern at the scourge of terrorism, and a",
  "Joint Working Group on terrorism has been meeting in recent years. However, at the second",
  "India-EU summit (2001), there were di\ufb03culties in formulating the text of the Declaration",
  "Against International Terrorism. After the terrorist attack on the Indian parliament (December",
  "2001), which brought India\u2019s threat to go to war with Pakistan and the mobilization of 1m.",
  "troops in South Asia in the summer of 2002, several EU leaders visited India in an attempt to",

  "Unlike the EU, it was the USA that took the lead in compelling Pakistan to ban terrorist",

  "clusion of bilateral Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) with India, South Korea and the Association",
  "for Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). The Helsinki Summit (October 2006) endorsed the",

  "challenging enough without the inclusion of non-trade issues, and stressed the importance of",
  "being conscious of the danger of overloading the agenda and stalling the entire process.",
  "The Council and the Representatives of member states meeting within the Council formally",
  "adopted a negotiating mandate for \u2018a new generation\u2019 FTA with India on 23 April 2007. Nine",
  "rounds of negotiations have so far been held since negotiations began in June 2007. There",
  "continue to be di\ufb03culties because of insistence by the Union to include non-trade provisions",
  "like an environmental and social clause, di\ufb00erences over issues like intellectual property rights,",
  "government procurement, etc., and e\ufb00orts by Brussels to link trade with climate and India\u2019s",
  "social sector performance. The Union cites the growing assertiveness and sensitivity of the",
  "European Parliament on these issues after the Treaty of Lisbon came into force in December",
  "2009. India remains staunchly opposed to the inclusion of \u2018extraneous\u2019 non-trade issues in the",
  "talks. New Delhi has asserted that under no circumstances will it be willing to undertake any",
  "commitments over and above what it has already agreed to in the World Trade Organization",
  "(WTO), and that there are other forums, like the International Labour Organization (ILO), in",
  "which to address these issues. The two sides will eventually be able to \ufb01nd the appropriate",
  "language to deal with these issues. The European Parliament is not likely to own up to the",
  "responsibility of rejecting an agreement with India for which there is strong support",
  "The new trade and investment agreement will set the parameters of the India-EU trading",
  "relationship for the coming decades. Their negotiation had in the summer of 2010 entered the",

  "Conclusions",
  "After 10 summits, India and the EU are gradually getting used to working together. Rhetoric",
  "continues to be strong. Post-Lisbon, the EU sees India as a signi\ufb01cant factor:",

  "Despite shared values, the lack of shared interests on a number of issues will continue to limit",
  "co-operation. India and the EU have many common interests, but transforming them into co-",
  "ordinated policies has been rather elusive. Despite the ongoing dialogue and consultations",
  "between India and the EU on 45 or so issues, Brussels and the member states complain that",
  "they encounter problems of capacity and resources of India\u2019s Ministry of External A\ufb00airs. In",
