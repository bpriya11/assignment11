  "The Himalayan kingdoms of Nepal and Bhutan and the Indian state of Sikkim have occupied",

  "for India can be visualized from two di\ufb00erent angles: a) the strategic importance of these",
  "Himalayan actors for India\u2019s national security; and b) the place of these Himalayan actors in",
  "India\u2019s own role perception in international politics. The Himalayas have become the southern",
  "border of the People\u2019s Republic of China, but they do not occupy such an important place in",
  "the Chinese life and culture as they do in India. The Himalayan kingdoms of Nepal, Bhutan",

  "blocking countervailing Chinese competition.3 The \u2018ring fence\u2019 system operated by Britain",
  "resulted in an independent but friendly and co-operative Nepal, with Sikkim and Bhutan as",
  "Indian protectorates, and with Tibet as an autonomous bu\ufb00er state guaranteeing India\u2019s com-",
  "mercial and strategic interests there. On this \u2018imperial chessboard\u2019, the British Government sent",
  "a strong note of warning to a weak China on 11 April 1910, which informed China that no",
  "interference in the a\ufb00airs of the Himalayan states would be tolerated.4 At the time these areas",

  "in play for India. India was, though, in an enviable position on gaining independence in 1947,",
  "so far as security in the north was concerned, with \u2018Forward Rights\u2019 inherited in Tibet and a",
  "weak China still mired in civil war.",
  "Jawaharlal Nehru, India\u2019s architect of foreign policy, wanted to continue the British policy",
  "towardstheHimalayanstates,buthefailedtodoso.Itmighthavehappenedduetothelackof",
  "long-term strategic vision or excessive idealistic structures of Indian foreign policy. The fault",

  "his associates re\ufb02ected that of the British: treating Tibet as an autonomous bu\ufb00er state between",
  "that of India and China, recognizing vague Chinese suzerainty but not sovereignty over Tibet.",
  "Thus, in March 1947 a Tibetan delegation was invited to the Asian Relations Conference in",
  "Delhi, despite protests from Chinese (Kuomintang) delegates.",
  "When the Chinese People\u2019s Liberation Army (PLA) marched into Tibet in 1950, Indians",
  "(including Nehru), vociferously protested against the invasion. Such actions indicated India\u2019s",
  "preferenceforcontinuingtheBritishpolicytowards Tibet.NehruwantedtoprotecttheIndian",
  "security interests in the Himalayan regions. As the Chinese communists neared their revolu-",
  "tionary victory, Nehru rushed through a series of defence treaties with Bhutan (August 1949),",
  "Nepal(July1950)andSikkim(December1950).ThesecountriesconstitutedNehru\u2019sde\ufb01nition",
  "of a redrawn security zone. Throughout the 1950s Nehru demonstrated his serious commit-",
  "menttothisHimalayandoctrine.InFebruary1951heestablishedtheNorthandNorth-Eastern",
  "Defence Committee, andvisitedthe North-East Frontier Agency (NEFA),Sikkimand Bhutan.",
  "In public statements in August and December 1959, Nehru o\ufb00ered support in the defence of",
  "Nepal, Bhutan and Sikkim in case of Chinese invasion.",
  "Gradually, though, India started losing ground in the Himalayan regions vis-\u00e0-vis China.",
  "Neither India\u2019s vital interests in the Himalayas nor its stand on the border problem were",
  "recognized in writing or respected in practice by China. Nor was the autonomy of Tibet",
  "respected by China. Ironically, Nepal seems to have had a \ufb01rmer sense of this. When Nehru",
  "was faced with the Nepalese Government\u2019s argument that \u2018they had not recognised the",
  "sovereignty of China over Tibet which for them was an autonomous state\u2019, this was met by",
  "Nehru\u2019s rejoinder that \u2018it was well known that Tibet is part of Chinese State and the Chi-",
  "nese exercised full sovereignty there. This fact has inevitably to be recognized\u2019.6 In recog-",
  "nizing full Chinese control of Tibet, as a \u2018region of China\u2019 in the 1954 Agreement on Trade",
  "and Intercourse between the Tibet Region of China and India, strategically India surrendered its",
  "outer ring of defence without gaining anything substantial in return from China. Ginsburg",
  "and Mathos, in their study on Communist China and Tibet (1964) clearly brought out the",
  "geographical importance of Tibet in this domino-theory type logic: \u2018he who holds Tibet",
  "dominates; he who dominates the Himalayan piedmont threatens the Indian sub-continent;",
  "and he who threatens the Indian sub-continent may well have all of south-east Asia within",
  "its reach, and with it, all of Asia\u2019.7 The Chinese occupation of Tibet brought home to India",
  "the urgency of taking e\ufb00ective steps to safeguard its national security in the north. The",
  "occupation of Tibet by China was in itself a grave threat to India\u2019s security. To add to",
  "India\u2019s woes, the Chinese claimed that the Himalayan kingdoms of Nepal, Bhutan and",
  "Sikkim were in fact Chinese \u2018Middle Kingdom\u2019 territories that China had lost to the",
  "imperialist in her bad days and now that China had acquired strength it would try to regain",
  "the \u2018lost territories\u2019. Occupation of Tibet by a strong China exposed the Himalayan states",
  "and India\u2019s northern frontier to a grave potential threat, with Nepal-Bhutan-Sikkim con-",
  "stituting what Dawa Norbu described as a \u2018new bu\ufb00er zone\u2019, after the old bu\ufb00er (Tibet) had",
  "fallen under China\u2019s sovereign political-military control in 1951.8 It is to Nepal, Bhutan and",
  "Sikkim that we now turn.",

  "Nepal is separated from the Tibet region of China by the great Himalayan range. Except for",

  "The withdrawal of Britain from the Indian subcontinent in 1947 brought India\u2019s inheritance of",
  "British pre-eminence in Nepal. Nehru\u2019s sense in 1948\u201349 was that \u2018politically our interest in",
  "Nepal is so important\u2019, and that Indian policy was \u2018to prevent the exploitation of Nepal by",
  "[other] foreign interests\u2019, but to \u2018help in developing Nepal to the mutual advantage of Nepal",
  "and India\u2019.11 However, one new \u2018foreign interest\u2019 raising its head was the conclusion of the",
  "Chinese civil war, and with it the emergence of a strong People\u2019s Republic of China. On 6",
  "December 1950, summing up India\u2019s security concerns vis-\u00e0-vis Nepal, Nehru had said to par-",
  "liament: \u2018from time immemorial the Himalayas have provided us with magni\ufb01cent frontiers.",
  "We cannot allow that barrier to be penetrated because it is also the principal barrier to India.",
  "Therefore, as much as we appreciate the independence of Nepal, we cannot allow anything to",
  "go wrong in Nepal or permit that barrier to be crossed or weakened, because that would be a",
  "risktoourowncountry\u2019.12TheIndo-NepaleseTreaty ofPeace andFriendship(July 1950)had",
  "the two states \u2018agree mutually to acknowledge and respect the complete sovereignty, territorial",
  "integrity and independence of each other\u2019 (Article 1).13 However, with regard to sensitive",
  "military-defence matters, Article 5 gave India an important role: \u2018the Government of Nepal",
  "shall be free to import, from or through the territory of India, ammunition or warlike material",
  "and equipment necessary for the security of Nepal. The procedure for giving e\ufb00ect to this",
  "arrangement shall be worked out by the two governments acting in consultation\u2019. Conse-",
  "quently, a close consultative relationship settled down on commerce, defence and foreign rela-",
  "tions, with Indian military missions deployed during the 1950s. India has subsequently",
  "maintained that any attack on Nepal would be regarded as an aggression against India. How-",
  "ever, the 1950 Treaty\u2019s military-consultative clause faced some resentment in Nepal, which",

  "the 1954Agreement on Trade and Intercourse between the Tibet Region of China and India. Once this",
  "had occurred, China began to claim territory along the Indo-Tibetan border, using the provi-",
  "sions of the 1954 Treaty as its rationale. The following year, China began to compete with",
  "India for a sphere of in\ufb02uence in Nepal. The changed strategic status of Nepal provided an",
  "opportunity to the Nepalese rulers to swing from one posture to another.14",
  "Changing foreign policy of Nepal",
  "The \ufb01rst signi\ufb01cant foreign policy shift by Nepal was the establishment of diplomatic relations",
  "with China in 1955. Shortly after his return to Nepal, King Mahendra, to the great surprise of",
  "all (and more so of the Indian leaders) announced the formation of a cabinet headed by Tanka",
  "Prasad Acharya. Just after assuming o\ufb03ce in 1956, Acharya declared at a press conference that",
  "Nepal would pursue a policy of equal friendship with all countries, and accept economic and",
  "other help from all friendly countries, including China and Russia. King Mahendra set for",
  "Nepal the ultimate foreign policy objective of balancing the external in\ufb02uences in order to",
  "minimize their capacity to restrict Nepal\u2019s freedom of action. The Nepalese Government",
  "embarked upon the policy of diversifying its relations, but alienated and antagonized India.",
  "NepalmadeaninformalrequesttoIndiasuggestingtherevisionoftheIndo-NepaleseTreatyof",
  "trade and commerce of 1950 and is reported to have secured an assurance from her. Shortly",
  "after the conclusion of the agreement, in September 1956, Acharya paid a visit to Beijing to",
  "become the \ufb01rst Nepalese prime minister to visit the People\u2019s Republic of China. Signi\ufb01cantly,",
  "he went to China before going over to India.",

  "the Kathmandu\u2013Kodari road, the construction of which started in 1963 and was completed in",
  "1965. The road provided a direct strategic connection between China and Nepal via the di\ufb03-",
  "cult Tibetan route. If Nepal was not able to resist an attack through this road, the Indian",
  "heartland would be easily accessible. For India, these developments were a cause of grave con-",
  "cern. The nature of this proximity was all the more troubling for India in wake of its defeat in",
  "the Sino-Indian war of 1962.",
  "Nepal is the only one of the three Himalayan kingdoms with enough power to play an",
  "autonomous role between China and India. China openly exhorted the Nepalese assertion of",
  "independence throughout the 1970s. Intense anti-India propaganda was directed by China",
  "towards Nepal. When India annexed Sikkim in 1974, Chinese propagandists argued that Nepal",
  "might be India\u2019s next target.",
  "The expanding role of China in Nepal and its implications for India",
  "In India, the growing friendship between Nepal and China produced concern and anxiety, the",
  "more so in the arrival of the CPN(M) as the largest party in the 2008 general elections, and",
  "formation of a Maoist-led government under Pushpa Kamal Dahal (Prachanda), which held",
  "o\ufb03ce until May 2009. The talks held by his defence minister, Ram Bahadur Thapa, heading a",
  "three-member delegation to witness the PLA\u2019s \u2018Warrior 2008\u2019 military exercise with China\u2019s",
  "defence minister, Gen. Li Guanglie, raised yet more concerns for India. The Chinese PLA",
  "wanted to extend its relations with the Maoist PLA in Nepal.",

  "distribute materials to undermine India\u2019s predominance in Nepal, to stress \u2018the benign role of",
  "China and caution the Nepalis about India\u2019s hegemonic intentions\u2019.15 One indication of this",
  "growing Chinese in\ufb02uence in and on Nepal is the latter\u2019s crackdown on Tibetan protests in",

  "detect \ufb02eeing Tibetans and keep a lid on unrest. Trans-border considerations are important",
  "here, China seeing Tibetan unrest as being stimulated by international forces operating from",
  "Nepal. Thus, in order to secure its southern Tibetan periphery, which it considers most vul-",
  "nerable, it feels the need to monitor clandestine activities in Nepal.",
  "China can also hope to capitalize on moves by land-locked Nepal to reduce its economic",
  "dependencyonIndia.IthasbeenmootingtheextensionoftheChina\u2013Tibetrailwaylinedown",
  "into Nepal. India is Nepal\u2019s largest trading partner, accounting for more than 60% of its trade,",
  "and 12 of the 13 trade routes for Nepal are via India. About 50% of Nepal\u2019s remittances come",
  "from India. Thus, for strategic and economic reasons, the Maoists feel the urgent need to cul-",
  "tivate deeper ties with China on the one hand, and reduce their dependence on India on the",
  "other. This, therefore, also explains why the Maoists called for renegotiating the 1950 Treaty",
  "between India and Nepal.",
  "The collapse in May 2009 of the Maoist-led government of Prachanda has, though, given",
  "India the chance to regain some ground vis-\u00e0-vis China in Nepal. Indeed, faced with new",
  "intelligence-sharing arrangements between India and Nepal, and talks of an Indian air base",
  "being set up in Nepal, worried Chinese sources were warning in March 2010 that \u2018India has",
  "resumed military cooperation with Nepal [\u2026] the struggle between pro-India and pro-China",
  "forces in Nepal is at a critical stage and China needs to pay more attention to its interests",
  "there\u2019.16",
  "Changing contours of Indo-Nepalese relations",
  "India-Nepal relations have been special from the very beginning, with \u2018interdependence\u2019 often",
  "used in connection with its Hindu monarchy.17 In recent years India\u2019s \u2018uneasy partner\u2019 has",
  "presented uncertainties for India, which in turn has had a somewhat \u2018rickety roadmap\u2019 to",

  "India ethos into Nepalese nationalism to serve their narrow political and economic interests",
  "during the monarchy. Even the kingdom\u2019s socio-economic and ethnic divide between the hills",
  "and the plains have been linked to anti-India feelings.",
  "Such anti-India sentiments were further strengthened under the Maoist Government in",

  "regulation ofthe Nepal\u2013Indiaborder,banning entryofIndianvehicles into Nepal,andtheend",
  "of Gurkha recruitments in the Indian armed forces. The Nepalese Maoists have tended to",
  "maintain a staunch anti-India posture from the very beginning. Prachanda said, \u2018Nepal after",
  "signing the Sugauli Treaty of 1816 with the then British India entered into the era of a partial-",
  "colonial and feudal system which continues to date\u2019, and stated further, \u2018we are yet to liberate",
  "ourselves from the partial colonial and feudal system with the dawn of the republican order\u2019.19",
  "Outside players are involved in this process, with China keen to end the Nepalese over-",
  "dependence on India. Another active player in fanning anti-India feelings in Nepal has been",
  "Pakistan. As Chengappa notes, there has been a convergence of interests there against India:",
  "\u2018over the years India has been the primary focus of Pakistan-Nepal relations [\u2026] Pakistan has",

  "reduce its dependence on India\u2019.20",
  "Consistent ideological feeding against India among the Nepalese youth has been takingplace",
  "for the last many years. Covertly and overtly it was started under the monarchy of King",

  "armed revolt\u2019.23 Thus India\u2019s external and internal challenges converge, and make ties with",
  "Nepal of extreme importance, yet also of extreme delicacy for India.",
  "Bhutan",
  "Bhutan, the durk yul \u2018land of thunder dragons\u2019, is the second largest of the Himalayan king-",
  "doms, with an area of around 38,394 sq km that is less than one-quarter of the size of Nepal\u2019s",
  "area of around 140,797 sq km. Two-thirds of Bhutan is covered with forest and everywhere",
  "there are mountains and strong water \ufb02ows. Bhutan is bounded on the north (like Nepal) by",
  "the Tibetan region of China, and on the south and the east by the Indian union territory of",
  "Arunachal Pradesh. Geopolitically, the location of Bhutan between the Tibetan plateau and the",
  "Assam-Bengal plains of India makes it important for India; as one Indian analyst summarized,",
  "\u2018Bhutanoccupiesastrategicpositiononournorthernborder\u2019.24Intermsofexternalboundaries,",
  "Bhutan has a border of 605 km with India and 470 km with China; the two countries \u2018collide\u2019",

  "China in the eastern Himalayas in the military sense. Western Bhutan borders the sensitive",
  "Chumbi valley, and therefore guards any possible Chinese ingress routes in any possible future",

  "puted by China. Similarly, eastern Bhutan adjoins vital Indian Army defences in Arunachal",
  "Pradesh, an Indian state still wholly claimed by China.",
  "Bhutan\u2019s special relationship with India",
  "On the one hand, Bhutan has cultural a\ufb03nities with Tibet, as 80% of Bhutan\u2019s population was",
  "of Tibetan stock, and their language, customs and religion were much like those of the Tibe-",
  "tans. On the other hand, Bhutan is geographically a part of the Indian subcontinent, and has",
  "extremely close political ties to India. Under the 1949 Treaty of Friendship and Neighbourli-",
  "ness, \u2018The Government of India undertakes to exercise no interference in the internal admin-",
  "istrationofBhutan.OnitsparttheGovernmentofBhutanagreestobeguidedbytheadviceof",
  "the Government of India in regard to its external relations\u2019 (Article 2).26 That particular \u2018gui-",
  "dance\u2019 clause was removed in the revised 2007 Treaty, however.27",
  "Between 1951 and 1958 India\u2019s relations with Bhutan and Sikkim were by and large har-",
  "monious. Various visits were quickly made by the Bhutanese rulers to India in 1952, 1954 and",
  "1955, re\ufb02ecting the close relations between the two countries. Nehru, the architect of Indian",
  "foreign policy, fully realized the importance of Bhutan for Indian security. Nehru\u2019s description",
  "of Bhutan in 1954 was sanguine:",
  "Our relations with Bhutan are friendly. Bhutan is a semi-independent State whose foreign",
  "policy has to be conducted in consultation with us. The State receives a subsidy from us",
  "also. They are very anxious to preserve their independence, but realise that they have to",
  "rely on India. We have no desire to interfere internally in Bhutan but we have made it",
  "clear that,sofarasexternalmattersareconcernedoranydefencematters,Indiaisintensely",
  "interested and must have a say. This is the position.28",
  "Such perceptions remain the position for India. The persistent Indian e\ufb00ort to persuade Bhutan",
  "to become a partner yielded some result, and by 1958 Bhutan was persuaded to embark on the",
  "gradual modernization of the country and link its fate with India. Nehru was the \ufb01rst foreign",
  "dignitary ever to visit Bhutan. During his 1958 stay in Bhutan, Nehru had discussions with the",
  "Maharaja and other high o\ufb03cials of the kingdom. The visit was not only a landmark in Bhu-",
  "tan\u2019s relations with India, but also a step in the gradual opening of Bhutan for India. It also",
  "brought assurances from Nehru in the Indian parliament, on 29 August 1959, that any (Chi-",
  "nese) aggression against Bhutan, and Sikkim, would be considered an act of aggression against",
  "India. A team of Indian military o\ufb03cers visited Bhutan in 1961 in order to make the necessary",
  "arrangements with Bhutan for its defence. Half a century later and such linkages are still very",
  "evident between India and Bhutan.",
  "Military and economic assistance",
  "India\u2019s continuing military assistance to Bhutan was reciprocated in 2003 when Bhutanese",
  "military forces took action in Operation All Clear against some 30 camps of Indian insurgent",
  "groups(suchastheUnitedLiberationFrontofAssam\u2014ULFA\u2014theNationalDemocraticFront",
  "of Bodoland, and the Kamtapur Liberation Organization), which had set-up training camps on",
  "Bhutanese territory.29 India has assured Bhutan of its continued support for military and devel-",
  "opment projects, and is currently preparing a comprehensive modernization package for the",
  "Bhutanese army. It has agreed to sell low-tech arms to Bhutan\u20145.56-mm INSAS assault ri\ufb02es,",

  "India will also establish a joint military grid to patrol against Indian militants.30",
  "India is the single largest donor to Bhutan; in fact, it has \ufb02ooded Bhutan with economic aid.",
  "Eight Five Year Plans in Bhutan have been completed since 1961, the \ufb01rst two of which were",
  "totally \ufb01nanced by India. Indian contributions to Bhutan\u2019s Five Year Plans remain signi\ufb01cant.",
  "TheIndian contribution to the7th Five YearPlan for 1992\u201397was750crores; to the8th Five",
  "YearPlanfor1997\u20132002itwas1,050crores(26%ofthetotalplanoutlay);tothe9thFiveYear",
  "Plan for 2002\u201307 it was 2,600 crores. India has also contributed to Bhutan\u2019s development out-",
  "side the scope of the Five Year Plans, through megaprojects on infrastructure and power sup-",
  "plies. Bhutan also enjoys complete free trade with India, and remains dependent on India for",
  "most of its imports and exports. During 2008 imports from India were of the order of",
  "Rs17,330m. and constituted 74% of Bhutan\u2019s total imports. Bhutan\u2019s exports to India in 2008",
  "amounted to Rs21,480m. and constituted 95% of its total exports.",
  "Manmohan Singh\u2019s visit to Bhutan in May 2008, the previous visit being by Narashima Rao",
  "in 1993, brought a rafter of economic and hydro-electric energy deals, with India also again",
  "agreeing to fund nearly one-quarter of Bhutan\u2019s 10th Five Year Plan, with an outlay of 3,400",
  "crores. In his speech to the Bhutanese parliament, the Indian Prime Minister reckoned that",
  "India\u2019s wider total bilateral economic engagement with Bhutan over the next \ufb01ve years was to",
  "be of the order of Rs100,000m. (10,000 crores). In terms of security, he \ufb02agged up new",
  "security issues, where \u2018India and Bhutan are well placed to create a new paradigm for inter-",
  "governmental cooperation in the areas of water security and environmental integrity. The",
  "Himalayan glaciers are our common asset and we can do much more together to devise stra-",
  "tegies to combat global warming\u2019.31 Interestingly, though, he avoided any mention of Bhutan\u2019s",
  "security problems with China, though he did announce the construction of the \ufb01rst railway",
  "linkage between Bhutan and India, perhaps a response to China\u2019s construction of a direct rail-",
  "way line to Lhasa and its moves to extend it to the borders of Nepal and Bhutan. Bhutan\u2019s",
  "moves against terrorist groups and its common problems with China have moved Bhutan\u2019s",
  "relationship with India \u2018from development cooperation to strategic partnership\u2019, albeit between",
  "two partners with very di\ufb00erent power.32",
  "The Chinese stand on Bhutan",
  "The July 1958 issue of China Pictorial published a map of China in which the Sino-Indian",
  "border was indicated by a thick brown line. This map once again included a large chunk of",

  "dated 22 March 1959, Nehru wrote to the Chinese premier that the publication of Chinese",

  "Recent developments in Bhutan and concerns for India",
  "India assumed the responsibility for the defence of Bhutan because of what it considered to be",
  "China\u2019s ruthless actions in Tibet and its aggressive posture along the disputed borders. Bhutan",
  "has also become concerned about China\u2019s road-building ventures on its immediate northern",
  "borders in recent times. In November 2004 Bhutan lodged a formal protest to Beijing stating",
  "that some of China\u2019s road building programme violated the Bhutan-China Agreement on the",
  "Maintenance of Peace and Tranquillity Along the Sino-Bhutanese Border Areas (1998). The agreement",
  "stipulatesthatChinaandBhutanwillmaintainpeaceandtranquillityontheborders,upholdthe",
  "status quo of the boundary prior to March 1959 and not resort to unilateral action to alter the",
  "status quo of the border. China purportedly agreed to suspend the construction work until the",
  "next round of border talks in 2005, but then resumed activity, amidst inconclusive border talks",
  "and cross-border incursions. This all led to Indian accusations of China\u2019s \u2018bullying and teasing",
  "tactics\u2019.35 Chinese troop movements in late 2007 into the disputed Chumbi valley tri-junction",
  "between Bhutan, China (Tibet) and India (Sikkim) brought immediate Indian reinforcements,",
  "and pointed attention towards Sikkim\u2019s role in Himalayan politics.",
  "Sikkim",
  "Sikkim is the smallest of the three Himalayan kingdoms, with an area of 7,096 sq km (2,739 sq",
  "miles). The relatively short, but strategically important, Sikkim\u2013China frontier lies between the",
  "Nepal\u2013China and Bhutan\u2013China borders. There are several easily traversable passes on this",
  "border,themostimportantbeingNathuLa.DuringBritishruleSikkimwasnotconsideredpart",
  "of British India, either as an allied princely state or as a colonial territory. Instead, relations",
  "between Sikkim and British India were handled under a separate set of treaties. Those agree-",
  "ments did, however, establish British administrative control over Sikkim, which was considered",
  "a protectorate. Following Indian independence, India\u2019s role increased when an Indian o\ufb03cial",
  "was loaned to Sikkim to serve as prime minister and reorganize the region\u2019s administrative",
  "system. Sikkim-India relations became closer still in 1950, as the Chinese occupation of Tibet",
  "destroyed India\u2019s Tibetan bu\ufb00er. China\u2019s move prompted India\u2019s leaders to debate the proper",
  "approach to Sikkim.",
  "Sikkim came under India\u2019s umbrella with the India-Sikkim Peace Treaty, signed in Decem-",
  "ber 1950.36 Under the Treaty, politically \u2018Sikkim shall continue to be a Protectorate of India,",

  "IV). India\u2019s argument was that such arrangements were \u2018dictated by the facts of geography\u2019.37",
  "Sikkim remained ethnically divided. The eruption of serious ethnic rioting and anti-Chogyal",
  "(Sikkim\u2019s ruler) demonstrations in early 1973 provided India with an opportunity to act, with",
  "policy inspired by a belief that India must act or China would take advantage of the situation.",

  "seeking their support. He also gave a press conference in Kathmandu criticizing India\u2019s moves",
  "and challenging the legality of Sikkim\u2019s new status as an Indian territory. The meeting with",
  "Chinese and Pakistani representatives sealed the Chogyal\u2019s fate and provided the pretext for",
  "which India had been waiting to move ahead with the full incorporation of Sikkim. Conse-",
  "quently, Sikkim\u2019s assembly called for the Chogyal\u2019s removal and a full merger with India. A",
  "referendum was quickly organized, resulting in overwhelming support for both moves. On 29",
  "April 1975 Sikkim was incorporated into the Republic of India as a full state. Sikkim\u2019s mon-",
  "archy was abolished and the region became a state of India, operating under the administrative",
  "and constitutional rules applicable to other Indian states.",

  "troops undermined Wen Jiabao\u2019s assertions in 2005 that \u2018Sikkim is no longer the problem",
  "between China and India\u2019.39",
  "Conclusions",
  "Garver\u2019s sense remains persuasive, that \u2018taken together, and placed in the context of their par-",
  "ticular location and terrain, the status of Nepal, Sikkim and Bhutan are highly signi\ufb01cant. The",

  "the integrity of India\u2019s defensive barrier in the Himalayan ranges\u2014in other words, geopolitical.",
  "From the Indian perspective, China\u2019s approach is di\ufb03cult to understand. China has taken for",
  "itself the largest bu\ufb00er, the vast area of Tibet, destroying Tibet\u2019s culture in the process and",
  "ignoring persistent Indian protests. India desires for itself a much smaller bu\ufb00er in the three",
  "Himalayan units of Nepal, Bhutan and Sikkim, and does not seek to alter the traditional cul-",
  "tures of these areas. Having consolidated its hold over Tibet, China now seeks to erode India\u2019s",
