  "Climate change is an all-encompassing issue that directly touches upon human development",
  "and people\u2019s livelihood. It has e\ufb00ects in combination with other major issues and such interac-",

  "shaped and dominated the international agenda and will increasingly be a game-changer in the",
  "future.",
  "The science of climate change, blunt in its observation, points to the fact that the planet\u2019s",
  "climate system is being pushed beyond its carrying capacity by dangerous anthropogenic inter-",
  "ference. However, the science has not positively converged with political decisions. In fact, as",
  "scienti\ufb01c evidence becomes far more noticeable, the politics of climate change is becoming",
  "stubbornly intractable. The search for a global solution to climate change based on \u2018common",
  "but di\ufb00erentiated responsibilities\u2019, the position taken by India and other countries like the",
  "People\u2019s Republic of China, has thus resulted in a political impasse.2 This indeed is an entren-",
  "ched irony of the international system. While states are prime movers of issues, they, however,",
  "tend to determine actions by perception of sovereignty, national interest and security. The sci-",
  "ence of climate change may have awakened us but the politics of it remain perennially divided",
  "and contested.3 Characteristically, climate change has entered the realm of negotiations. Issues",
  "such as national action plans (rather than global binding commitments), leadership roles and",

  "is development itself\u2019.9 On mitigation, the 11th Five Year Plan is unequivocal: \u2018with a share",

  "the \u2018per capita emissions\u2019 principle.",
  "The \u2018per capita emissions\u2019 argument has become a strong counter-response to the unsustain-",

  "also the \u2018common but di\ufb00erentiated responsibilities\u2019 of di\ufb00erent countries. Contrasting calcula-",

  "70 per cent of the total global CO emissions\u2019, and that \u2018Indian citizens emit less than 0.25",

  "Energy challenges and climate change",
  "For a rising economic power like India, the interplay between energy, environment and devel-",
  "opment policy is complex and challenging. There are issues of eradication of poverty and eco-",
  "nomic growth, on the one hand, and the sustainability of natural resources and energy choices",
  "on the other. India\u2019s development path with a projected growth rate of 8%\u20139% is inextricably",
  "dependent upon external fossil fuel supply and, in the absence of su\ufb03cient domestic oil resour-",
  "ces, its quest for energy security is paramount.14 While global mitigation strategies are still being",
  "deliberated, India\u2019s domestic strategy sets forth an approach towards a low-carbon economy,",
  "principallytoreduceitsdependencyonfossilfuelswithoutcompromisingitssteadygrowthrate.",
  "India\u2019s energy scenario in the coming decades will largely depend on the energy use choices.",
  "However, at any reduced level, fossil fuels will remain the dominant source of energy in any",
  "conceivable scenario up to 2030 and in all probability beyond. According to projections by the",
  "IPCC, India will experience dramatic increases in energy and greenhouse gas emissions in the",
  "world if it sustains an 8% annual economic growth rate or more, since its primary energy",
  "demand will then multiply at least three- to four-times its present levels. There is now a clear",
  "recognition that business-as-usual is no longer tenable.",
  "India\u2019s Integrated Energy Policy, adopted in 2006, is a response to managing the energy",
  "agenda through various measures. Such measures include:15",

  "Year Plan suggestion for faster and more inclusive growth, targeting 9%\u201310% from 2007\u201312,",
  "seems far too ambitious. Calculations suggest that India needs about 500 MW of power each",
  "week for the next 25 years to sustain the present growth rate of 8%. India\u2019s current installed",
  "power capacity is close to 145 GW, of which the overwhelming majority, 52%, comes from",

  "Fora country ofIndia\u2019ssize andenergy requirements, 145GW isnot su\ufb03cient. Thegrowth",

  "be 3.9 Gt per capita per year.17",
  "The emphasis for India needs to be on pursuing carbon abatement policies that minimize",

  "argument that a new and con\ufb01dent India needs to go beyond its narrow con\ufb01nements and",

  "Conclusions",
  "Climate change presents unprecedented challenges and opportunities for India. In the 1970s",
  "India\u2019s position was based on ideological preconception and linked to development and pov-",
  "erty.Itwasarticulatedwithunmatchedconviction.Sincethe1990stheclimatedebatehasbeen",
  "about projection, posturing and grandstanding. In recent times, particularly post-Copenhagen,",
  "there seems to be a rethink and re-evaluation that suggests that Indian policy-makers, along",
  "with business and industry, are responding to both the energy challenge and climate change",
  "challenge.India\u2019s\u2018percapitaemissions\u2019positionhasbeenheatedlydiscussed,andwithincreasing",
  "intensitydomestically.Stressingemissionsrightsisonething,butstressingotherlargerobjectives",
  "of a climate-responsible development agenda is equally important both in operative and func-",
  "tional terms. India needs a new narrative that is bold and forward-looking and not trapped in",
  "regressive approaches.",
  "Emissions rights cannot be situated outside the framework of equitable human development.",
  "India\u2019s argument on emissions rights is valuable to the extent of being allowed the space and",
  "time to develop, but it cannot be an excuse for not taking e\ufb00ective action to curb the dangers",
  "of climate change. India needs to ensure a conducive global environment for furthering its",
  "economic interests, enhanced trade and investment in\ufb02ows, technology transfers and energy",
  "security. Politically, as the international system transitions to real multipolarity, existing power-",
  "holders may seek to freeze this move, to continue the existing inequities in the international",
  "order. To break such exclusivity, India needs to balance its stance on external climate change",
  "negotiations with its internal action plan. India should be seen as the change. Taking unilateral",
  "steps in mitigating emissions and setting voluntary targets for energy e\ufb03ciency should convey",
  "the message that it is not a deal-breaker but a game-changer. The critical choice that India will",
  "havetomakeiswhentojointheemissions-reductionprocess,\ufb01rstonavoluntarybasisandlater",
  "with legally binding targets. For India, it will not be an either/or situation any more. It will",
  "necessitate a major shift of approach, strategy and, more importantly, a mindset.",
