  "Faced with wide-ranging opposition from outside, and with some dis-",

  "But for the most part the people who came to hear Nehru were sympath-",

  "but not by very much:",
  "[At] almost every place, city, town, village or wayside halt, people had-",
  "waited overnight to welcome the nation\u2019s leader. Schools and shops",
  "closed: milkmaids and cowherds had taken a holiday; the kisan and his",
  "helpmate took a temporary respite from their dawn-to-dusk programme",
  "of hard work in field and home. In Nehru\u2019s name, stocks of soda and",

  "of people fainted in milling crowds.37",
  "The independent press provided many instances of the popular mood. When",
  "Nehru spoke in Bombay, a procession, mainly of Muslims, marched to",
  "Chowpatty to the accompaniment of pipes and cymbals. It was headed by a",
  "pair of bullocks and a plough (the Congress symbol). Everywhere, crowds",
  "started collecting from early morning for talks scheduled for the afternoon;",
  "almost everywhere, barricades were broken in \u2018the enthusiasm to catch a",
  "glimpse of Mr Nehru\u2019. After he finished his speech in Delhi, Nehru was met",
  "as he came off the dais by a famous wrestler, Massu Pahalwan, who offered",
  "him a gold chain and remarked, \u2018This is only a token. I am prepared to give",
  "my life for you and the country. The media was much taken with a Telugu-",
  "speaking woman who went to listen to Nehru speak in the railway town of",
  "Kharagpur. As the prime minister lectured on she was consumed by labour",
  "pains. Immediately, a group of fellow Andhras made a ring around her: the",

  "The extraordinary popular appeal of the Indian prime minister is best",
  "captured in the testimony of the confirmed Nehru-baiter D. F. Karaka, editor",
  "of the popular Bombay weekly, the Current. He was in the vast crowd at",

  "One place even Nehru didn\u2019t get to was the tahsil of Chini in Himachal",
  "Pradesh. Here resided the first Indians to cast votes in a general election, a",
  "group of Buddhists. They voted on 25 October 1951, days before the winter",
  "snows shut their valleys from the world. The villagers of Chini owed allegi-",
  "ance to the Panchen Lama in Tibet, and were ruled by rituals administered",
  "by local priests. These included gorasang, a religious service to celebrate the",
  "completion of a new house; kangur zalmo,a ceremonial visit to the Buddhist",

  "be performed at five-year intervals: voting in a general election.40",
  "Polling began in the UK general election on the same day, although",

  "The day after Bombay went to the polls it was the turn of the Mizo",

  "When the votes were counted, the Congress had won comfortably. The party",

  "Kuthe to Ghatnakar Ambedkar,",
  "Aani Kuthe ha Lonivikya Kajrolkar?which, roughly translated, means:",
  "Where is the (great) constitution-maker Ambedkar",
  "And where the (obscure) butter-seller Kajrolkar? 46",
  "Yet, in the end, the prestige and hold of the Congress, and the fact that Nehru",
  "made several speeches in Bombay, carried Kajrolkar to victory. As one wag",

  "On the eve of the polls Sukumar Sen suggested they constituted \u2018the",
  "biggest experiment in democracy in human history\u2019. A veteran Madras editor",
  "was less neutral; he complained that \u2018a very large majority [will] exercise",

  "ation, the dishonesty possible\u2019, said the maharaja, adding, \u2018The world is far",
  "too shaky to permit such an experiment.\u201949",
  "Sharing this scepticism was Penderel Moon, a Fellow of All Souls Col-",
  "lege, and an ex-ICS man who had chosen to stay on in India. In 1941, Moon",
  "had spoken to the graduating students of Punjab University about the unsuit-",
  "ability of Western-style democracy to their social context. Now, eleven years",
  "later, he was the chief commissioner of the hill state of Manipur, and had to",
  "depute election officers and supervise the polling and the counting. As the",
  "people of Manipur went to the polls on 29 January, Moon wrote to his father",
  "that \u2018a future and more enlightened age will view with astonishment the ab-",
  "surd farce of recording the votes of millions of illiterate people\u2019.50",
  "Just as sceptical as the All Souls man was the Organiser, a weekly pub-",

  "leap in the dark\u2019. Yet Nehru, \u2018who has all along lived by slogans and stunts,",
  "would not listen\u2019.51There were times when even Nehru had second thoughts about universal",
  "franchise. On 20 December 1951 he took a brief leave of absence from the",

  "This was a rare confession, based no doubt on his recent experiences on the",

  "He confessed that he was \u2018appalled at the prospect of a poll of200 million",

  "even (as the Madras Mail put it), \u2018the biggest farce ever staged in the name",
  "of democracy anywhere in the world\u2019. But a trip through the country during",
  "polling changed his mind. Once, he had thought that poor countries needed a",
  "period of rule by a benevolent dictator as preparation for democracy. But the",
  "sight of many parties contesting freely, and of Untouchables and Brahmins",

  "unity, stability, moderation and friendly intercourse with the rest of the world",

  "the respected Lucknow sociologist D. P. Mukerji pointed out, \u2018great credit is",
  "due to those who are in charge of this stupendous first experiment in Indian",
  "history. Bureaucracy has certainly proved its worth by honestly discharging",
  "the duties imposed on it by a honest prime minister.\u201956",
  "The juxtaposition is important, and also ironical. For there was a time",
  "when Nehru had little but scorn for the bureaucracy. As he put it in his auto-",
  "biography, \u2018few things are more striking today in India than the progressive",
  "deterioration, moral and intellectual, of the higher services, more especially",
  "the Indian Civil Services. This is most in evidence in the superior officials,",
  "but it runs like a thread throughout the services.\u201957 This was written in 1935,",
  "when the objects of his derision had the power to put him and his like in jail.",
  "And yet, fifteen years later, Nehru was obliged to place the polls in the hands",
  "ofmen he would once have dismissedas imperialist stooges.",

  "N 1952 election the Indian writer Nirad C. Chaudhuri pro-",
  "OTLONGAFTERTHE",
  "duced an essay on Jawaharlal Nehru for a popular magazine. The writer was",
  "by this time moderately well known, but his subject still towered over both",
  "him and everybody else. Nehru\u2019s leadership, remarked Chaudhuri, \u2018is the most",
  "important moral force behind the unity of India\u2019. He was \u2018the leader not of a",
  "party, but of the people of India taken collectively, the legitimate successor to",
  "Gandhiji\u2019. As he saw it,",
  "Nehru is keeping together the governmental machine and the people, and",
  "without this nexus India would probably have been deprived of stable",
  "government in these crucial times. He has not only ensured co-operation",
  "between the two, but most probably has also prevented actual conflicts,",
  "cultural, economic, and political. Not even Mahatmaji\u2019s leadership, had it",
  "continued, would have been quite equal to them.",
  "If, within the country, Nehru is the indispensable link between the gov-",
  "erning middle-classes and the sovereign people, he is no less the bond",
  "between India and the world. [He serves as]India\u2019s representative to the",
  "great Western democracies, and, I must add, their representative to India.",
  "The Western nations certainly look upon him as such and expect him to",
  "guarantee India\u2019s support for them, which is why they are so upset when",
  "Nehru takes an anti-Western or neutral line. They feel they are being let",
  "down by one of themselves.1",
  "Through his long tenure as prime minister, Nehru served simultaneously",
  "as foreign minister of the government of India. This was natural, for among",
  "the Congress leadership he alone had a genuinely internationalist perspective.Gandhi had been universal is tin outlook but had hardly travelled abroad. The",
  "otherCongressleaders,suchasVallabhbhaiPatel,weredeterminedlyinward-",

  "He became a pillar of the progressive left, speaking often on public platforms",

  "London in 1936.3",
  "Representative of Nehru\u2019s ideas is a speech he delivered on \u2018Peace and",

  "\u2018probably no other people in the world have suffered so much, and have been",
  "exploited so much\u2019.4",
  "In the late summer of 1939 Nehru planned a trip to India\u2019s great Asian",
  "neighbour, China. He had been in friendly correspondence with Chiang Kai-",
  "shek, for, as he told a colleague, \u2018more and more I think of India and China",
  "pulling together in the future\u2019. He hoped to go by air to Chungking, spend",
  "three weeks travelling in the hinterland and to return home via the Burma",
  "Road. Sadly, the war in Europe put paid to the tour.5",
  "Nehru was jailed for his part in the Quit India movement of 1942. When",
  "he was released in July 1945 his energies were devoted to the endgames of",
  "empire. But after it became clear that India would soon be free, his thoughts",
  "turned once more to foreign affairs. In a radio broadcast of September 1946",
  "he singled out the United States, the Soviet Union and China as the three",
  "countries most relevant to India\u2019s future. The next year he spoke in the Con-",
  "stituent Assembly on how India would be friends with both the US and theUSSR, rather than become camp followers of one power \u2018in the hope that",
  "some crumbs might fall from their table\u2019. As he put it, \u2018we lead ourself\u2019.6",
  "An early articulation of what came to be known as \u2018non-alignment\u2019 is",
  "contained in a letter written by Nehru to K. P. S. Menon in January 1947, as",

  "\u2018suddenly become important in world affairs . Its countries could \u2018no longer",
  "be used as pawns by others\u2019.9 However, as the journalist G. H. Jansen re-",
  "called, Nehru\u2019s speech \u2018was not directly or strongly anti-colonial. \u201cThe old",
  "imperialisms are fading away\u201d, he said. With an almost contemptuous wave",

  "The conference concluded with a talk by Mahatma Gandhi. He regretted",
  "that the conference had not met in the \u2018real India of the villages but in the",
  "cities that were \u2018influenced by the West\u2019. The \u2018message of Asia\u2019, insisted",
  "Gandhi, was \u2018not to be learnt through the Western spectacles or by imitating",
  "the atom bomb . . . I want you to go away with the thought that Asia has to",
  "conquer the West through love and truth.\u2019 11",
  "Gandhi made his appearance, but this was really Nehru\u2019s show. His ad-",
  "mirers saw it as confirmation of his status as the authentic voice of resurgent",
  "Asia. His critics were less generous. In its account of the conference, the",
  "Muslim League newspaper, Dawn, complained of how \u2018skilfully he [Nehru]",
  "has worked himself into some sort of all-Asian leadership. That is just what",
  "this ambitious Hindu leader had intended \u2013 to thrust himself upon the Asian",

  "II",
  "Nehru had often been to Europe before Independence. His first trip to the",
  "United States, however, took place two years after he had assumed office as",
  "prime minister. The US had not loomed large in Nehru\u2019s political imagina-",
  "tion. His Glimpses of World History, for example, devotes far less space to it",
  "than to China or Russia. And what he says is not always complimentary. Thecapitalism of the American kind had led to slavery, gangsterism, and massive",

  "Nehru admired Roosevelt\u2019s attempts at regulating the economy, but he was",

  "be the most powerful vested interest in the modern world, and it is not go-",
  "ing to give up its power and privileges merely at the bidding of President",
  "Roosevelt\u2019.13",
  "Before Nehru\u2019s trip to America in late 1949, an enterprising reporter at",
  "Time magazine went through his writings.The exercise revealed that he had",
  "\u2018simply never given the subject [of America] much thought. As a British uni-",

  "in technology but predatory in its capitalism.\u201914",

  "American there were really only four kinds of Indians. These were: (1) the",
  "fabulous Indians, the maharajas and magicians coupled with equally exotic",
  "animals such as tigers and elephants; (2) the mystical Indians, a people who",
  "were \u2018deep, contemplative, tranquil, profound . . .\u2019; (3) the benighted Indians,",
  "who worshipped animals and many-headed gods, living in a country that",
  "was even more heathen than China; and (4) the pathetic Indians, plagued",
  "by poverty and crippled by disease \u2013 \u2018children with fly-encircled eyes, with",
  "swollen stomachs, children dying in the streets, rivers choked with bodies . .",
  ". Of these images perhaps the last two predominated. It was no accident that",
  "the book on the subcontinent best known in America was Katherine Mayo\u2019s",

  "American ones. But for this first high-level encounter between the youngest",
  "and richest to put them on hold. In August 1949, as he prepared for his trip,",
  "Nehru was uncharacteristically nervous. \u2018In what mood shall I address Amer-",

  "Nehru,was\u2018under-standingandappreciationofeachotheramongnationsand",
  "peoples\u2019.",
  "This was diplomatically put, but elsewhere Nehru spoke more directly.",
  "At Columbia University Nehru deplored the desire to \u2018marshal the world into",
  "twohostilecamps\u2019.India,hesaid,wouldalignwithneither,butpursue\u2018anin-",
  "dependent approach to each controversial or disputed issue\u2019. In his view, the",
  "maincauseofwarwasthepersistenceofracialismandcolonialism.Peaceand",
  "freedom could be secured only if the domination of one country or one race",
  "over another was finally brought toan end.18",
  "The American press was impressed with the Indian prime minister. The",
  "Chicago Sun Times went so far as to say that \u2018in many ways Nehru is the",
  "nearest thing this generation has to a Thomas Jefferson in his way of giving",
  "voice to the universal aspirations for freedom of people everywhere\u2019.19 The",
  "Christian Science Monitor described himas a \u2018World Titan\u2019 . When he left, a",
  "columnist in the St. Louis Post Dispatch observed that \u2018Nehru has departed",
  "fromus,leavingbehindcloudsofmisty-eyedwomen\u2019.20EvenTimemagazine",
  "admittedthat,whileAmericanswerestillnotsurewhatNehrustoodfor,\u2018they",
  "sensed in him, if not rare truth, a rare heart\u2019.21",
  "There was, however, one set of people who did not warm to the visitor",
  "from India \u2013 the mandarins of the State Department. Nehru had several",
  "long discussions with the secretary of state, Dean Acheson, but these went",
  "nowhere. In his memoirs Acheson wrote dismissively and with some despair",
  "about Nehru\u2019s visit. In their talks he found him \u2018prickly\u2019, arrogant \u2018he talked",
  "tome...asthoughIwasapublicmeeting),andtooreadytopickonthefaults",

  "ofhisown.WhenAchesonbroachedthesubjectofKashmir,hegot\u2018acurious",
  "combination of a public speech and flashes of anger and deep dislike of his",
  "opponents\u2019. Altogether, he found Nehru \u2018one of the most difficult men with",
  "whom I have ever had to deal\u2019.22",
  "OtherAmericanofficialsweremoresympathetictoNehru.Onesuchwas",
  "Chester Bowles, who was ambassador in New Delhi from 1951-3. Witness-",
  "ing Nehru at work in his own environment, Bowles was visibly impressed by",
  "his commitment to democracy and democratic procedure, and to the rights of",
  "minorities. Dean Acheson, and many other Americans, divided the world in-",
  "to two categories: friends and foes.23 That was not a reading that Bowles en-",
  "dorsed. He insisted that \u2018it is immature and ridiculous for us [Americans] tojump to the conclusion that because he [Nehru] is not 100 per cent for us, he",
  "must be against us\u2019.24",
  "During Bowles\u2019s tenure India and the United States drew closer. The US",
  "sentexpertsandequipmenttohelpwithIndianprogrammesofagriculturalde-",
  "velopment. But the popular mistrust persisted. A writer from Delaware, tour-",
  "ing the subcontinent in the early fifties, came across many educated Indians",
  "for whom the United States was a country \u2018isolated by gross faults, stewing",
  "alone in the unthinkable sins of materialism, imperialist ambitions, war mon-",
  "gering, political corruption, spiritual and cultural poverty, racial discrimina-",
  "tion and injustice\u2019.25",
  "The mutual distrust deepened after 1953, when the Republicans found",
  "themselves backinpoweraftertwentyyearsoutofit.Towardstheendofthat",
  "year William F. Knowland, the Republican leader in the Senate, undertook a",
  "six-week world tour. After he returned home he told the US News and World",
  "Report that Jawaharlal Nehru did not represent all the nations or peoples of",
  "Asia. Said Senator Knowland emphatically: \u2018Certainly Nehru does not speak",
  "fortheRepublicofKorea,forJapan,forFreeChinaorFormosa,forThailand,",
  "Viet Nam, Laos or Cambodia. He certainly does not speak for Pakistan. The",
  "only countries he might be able to speak for with some authority, or at least",
  "represent their views, would be India itself, Indonesia which is also neutralist",
  "in outlook, and perhaps Burma . . .\u2019.26",
  "These views were shared by the new secretary of state, John Foster",
  "Dulles. Dulles was the coldest of cold warriors, whose foreign policy was",
  "dominated by his obsession with communism. In the battle against the Soviet",
  "Union,Dulleswaspreparedtodisregardtheinternalpoliticalsystemsofother",
  "nations. Generally speaking, dictators who toed the American linewere to be",
  "preferredtodemocratswhodidn\u2019t:\u2018Ifheisabastard,atleastheisourbastard,",
  "as he is famously supposed to have said.",
  "Dulles and Nehru disliked each other from the start. The American",
  "claimed that \u2018the concept of neutrality is obsolete, immoral, and short",
  "sighted\u2019. Those who professed it were, in effect, crypto-communists. Nehru,",
  "naturally,didnottakekindlytothisinterpretation.AstheAustraliandiplomat",
  "Walter Crocker wrote, the Indian prime minister did not miss the irony that,",
  "as regards the sanctity of the Free World and the Free Life proclaimed",
  "byDulles,he,damnedbyDulles,wascarryingIndiathroughaargantuan",
  "effort towards Parliamentary Democracy, the rule of law, freedom and",
  "equality for all religions, and social and economic reforms, while amongthe countries which Dulles praised and subsidized because they were",
  "\u2018willing to stand up and be counted\u2019 as anti-Communist were effete or",
  "persecuting tyrannies, oligarchies and theocracies, sometimes corrupt as",
  "well as retrograde.27",
  "Dulles further offended Indian sensibilities when he suggested that Portugal",
  "\u2013 a trusted US ally \u2013 could keep its colony of Goa as long as it chose to.",
  "However, the secretary\u2019s decisive contribution to wrecking Indo-US relations",
  "wasthemilitarypacthesignedwithPakistaninFebruary1954.Asonehistor-",
  "ian drily remarked, \u2018Mr Dulles wanted pacts . . . Pakistan wanted money and",
  "arms.\u201928",
  "Almost from the time of Independence the United Kingdom had seen",
  "Pakistan as a potential ally in the Cold War; as, in fact, a \u2018strong bastion",
  "againstCommunism\u2019.Bycontrast,IndiawasseenasbeingsoftontheSoviets.",
  "WinstonChurchillhimselfwasmuchimpressedbytheargumentthatPakistan",
  "could be made to stand firm on Russia\u2019s eastern flank, much as that reliable",
  "Western client, Turkey, stood firm on the west. The brilliant young Harvard",
  "professor Henry Kissinger endorsed this idea \u2013 in his view, the \u2018defense of",
  "Afghanistan [from the Soviets] depends on the strength of Pakistan\u2019.29",
  "For Republicans like Dulles, the fight against communism was para-",
  "mount. Hence the tilt towards Pakistan, which he saw as a key member of",
  "a defensive ring around the Soviet Union. From bases in Pakistan American",
  "planes could strike deep into Soviet central Asia. Dulles\u2019s view was seconded",
  "by Vice-President Richard Nixon and their combined efforts ultimately pre-",
  "vailedoverPresidentEisenhower,whowasworriedaboutthefall-outinIndia",
  "following any formal alliance with Pakistan.30",
  "American military aid to Pakistan ran to about $80 million a year. The",
  "US also encouraged the Pakistanis to join the anti-Soviet military alliances in",
  "central and Southeast Asia known as CENTO and SEATO. Two months be-",
  "fore Dulles signed his pact with the Pakistan is an American missionary who",
  "had worked for years in the subcontinent warned that \u2018to weigh Pakistan mil-",

  "thoughtherewereotherstrainsonIndo-Americanrelationsaswell.Intheon-",
  "goingconflictsoftheColdWar\u2013asinKoreaandIndo-China\u2013Indiawasseen",
  "as being too neutral by far. Nehru\u2019s vigorous canvassing of the recognition of",
  "thePeople\u2019sRepublicofChina,andhisinsistencethatitbegiventheperman-",
  "ent seat in the UN Security Council then occupied by Taiwan, was also not",
  "taken to kindly by Washington. There were an increasing number of Americ-answhofeltthatNehruhad\u2018enteredthearenaofworldpoliticsasachampion",
  "challenging American wisdom\u2019.32",
  "As perhaps he had. For, as Nehru wrote to the industrialist G. D. Birla in",
  "May 1954, \u2018I do not think that there are many examples in history of a suc-",
  "cessionofwrongpoliciesbeingfollowedbyacountryasbytheUnitedStates",
  "in the Far East during the past five or six years. They have taken one wrong",
  "step after another . . . They think that they can solve any problem withmoney",
  "and arms. They forget the human element. They forget the nationalistic urges",
  "of people. They forget the strong resentment of people in Asia against impos-",
  "itions.\u201933",
  "The industrialist himself was rather keen that the two countries forge",
  "better relations. In October 1954 Birla visited the UnitedStates and spoke to",
  "across-sectionofinfluentialpeople.HeevenhadhalfanhourwithJohnFoster-",

  "to Pakistan, which is a constant and growing threat to us and, in effect, adds",
  "to our burdens much more than the actual aid they give to us.35",
  "The next month John Foster Dulles made so bold as to visit New Delhi.",
  "The record of his talks with the Indian government is still classified, but we",
  "do have the proceedings of a press conference he addressed. Here, the secret-",
  "ary of state was subject to a series of hostile questions. He was asked why he",
  "had said that Goa was an integral part of Portugal. Dulles did not deny this,",
  "but clarified that he was for a \u2018peaceful solution\u2019 of the controversy. Then the",
  "talk turned to military aid to Pakistan, and the possibility that it might lead",
  "to an escalation of the conflict in Kashmir. Dulles defensively answered that",
  "\u2018thearmssupplytoPakistanis notdesigned inanywaytobeathreat toIndia\u2019.",
  "When the questioner persisted, Dulles angrily remarked that \u2018we do not feel",

  "Ascompared to bourgeois countries, concluded Nehru, the Soviet Union",
  "treated its workers and peasants better, its women and children better,even its",
  "prisoners better. The credulousness of the narrative is made complete by the",
  "epigraph to the book of his travels \u2013 Wordsworth on the French Revolution:",

  "Nehru\u2019sbiographerpointsoutthathevisited\u2018theSovietUnioninthelast",
  "days of its first, halcyon period. If his reaction was idealistic, it was partly",
  "because there was still some idealism in the air. 39 This is true, after a fash-",
  "ion; for there was still aglow about Lenin (whose own intolerance was not",
  "yet widely known outside Russia); while the extermination of kulaks and the",
  "Siberian death camps lay in the future. And of course there were other such",
  "endorsements provided by Western fellow-travellers of the 1920s. Like them,",
  "Nehru had come intending to be impressed; and he was.40It was, above all, the Soviet economic system which most appealed to",
  "Nehru. As a progressive intellectual of his time, he thought state ownership",
  "more just than private property, state planning more efficient than the market.",
  "His Glimpses of World History contains an admiring account of the",
  "Sovietfive-year plans.Yetatnotime washeattracted bytheBolshevik model",
  "of armed revolution or by the one-party state. His training under Gandhi pre-",
  "disposed him towards non-violence, and his exposure to Western liberalism",
  "made him an enthusiast for electoral democracy and a free press.",
  "After Independence, relations with the Soviet Union were at first frosty.",
  "ThiswasbecausetheCommunistPartyofIndia,withMoscow\u2019sblessing,had",
  "attempted to overthrow the state. But the insurrection failed, and the Soviets",
  "also thawed. Now they sought to woo India away from the Western camp. In",

  "theSoviets\u2013unencumberedbydemocraticprocedure\u2013offeredtosend50,000",

  "ideology more flexible. It no longer mattered if acountry was socialist; what",
  "was crucial was whether it was on one\u2019s side.41",
  "The consummation of this change was the reception given to Jawaharlal",
  "Nehru when he visited the Soviet Union in 1955. \u2018Wherever Nehru went in",
  "the Soviet Union\u2019, wrote one observer, \u2018there were large crowds to greet him.",
  "In all the factories workmen gathered in thousands to have a glimpse of him.\u2019",

  "Six months later the Soviet leaders Bulganin and Khrushchev came for",

  "Western feeling which took vicarious pride in Russia\u2019s challenge to the USA.",
  "The crowds were biggest in radical, anti-imperialist Calcutta, where studentsandfactoryworkersmadeupagoodproportionofthehalfamillionwhocame",

  "nature, accustomed in its late twenties and early thirties to regard the Soviet",

  "over the vision of those days. Despite all that has happened since then, the",
  "Soviet[Union]stillretainsforhimsomeofthatenchantment.Toitsvirtueshe",
  "continues to be very kind, to its vices and cruelties, he is almost blind.\u201946",
  "The writer was A. D.Gorwala, a Western-oriented liberal. There were",
  "others like him, Indians who believed that India should ally more strongly",
  "with the democracies in the Cold War.47 But these were most likely out-",
  "numbered, and certainly outshouted, by those Indians who suspected the Un-",
  "ited States and favoured the Soviet Union. One reason for this was that while",
  "theAmericanswereloathtoasktheirEuropeanalliestodisbandtheirempires",
  "in Asia and Africa, the Russians spoke frequently about the evils of racialism",
  "and colonialism.48",
  "Nehru at first tried hard to avoid taking sides in the Cold War. But, as he",
  "often said, this non-alignment was not mere evasion; it had a positive charge",
  "to it. Athird bloc might come to act as a salutary moderating effect on the",
  "hubris of the superpowers. We have spoken already of the Asian Relations",
  "Conferencein1947.Anothersucheffort,inwhichNehruplayedanimportant",
  "part, was the Afro-Asian conference, held in the Indonesian city of Bandung",
  "in 1955.Only countries that had independent governments were invited to",
  "Bandung. Twenty-nine sent delegations, including India and China. Four",
  "Africannationswererepresented(theothersstilllayunderthecolonialyoke);",
  "but delegates from Iran, Iraq, Saudi Arabia and Syria all came. The meeting",
  "discussed methods of cultural and economic co-operation, and committed it-",
  "self firmly to the end of colonial rule. For, as President Sukarno of Indonesia",
  "observed, \u2018how can we say that colonialism is dead so long as vast areas of",
  "Asia and Africa are unfree?\u201949",
  "Nehru considered the Bandung Conference \u2018a great achievement\u2019; it",
  "\u2018proclaimed the political emergence in world affairs of over half the world\u2019s",
  "population. [But] it presented no unfriendly challenge or hostility to anyone .",
  ". .\u2019 Ashe told the Indian Parliament on his return, the historic links between",
  "Asian and African countries had been sundered by colonialism; now, as free-",
  "dom dawned, they could be revived and reaffirmed.50",
  "This last protestation was in answer to the charge that Bandung and",
  "the like were, in essence, anti-Western. How \u2018non-aligned\u2019, in fact, was non-",
  "alignment? In India, its ideals were put sternly to the test in the second half",
  "of 1956. In July of that year Gamal Abdel Nasser nationalized the company",
  "that managed the Suez Canal. Britain (whose strategic interests were most",
  "threatened by the action) reacted by asking for international control over the",
  "Canal. Nehru, who knew both parties well, tried hard to mediate. But he",
  "failed,andultimately,inlateOctober,theBritish,incollusionwiththeFrench",
  "and the Israelis, undertook a military invasion of Egypt. This act of neocolo-",
  "nialaggressiondrewworldwidecondemnation.Finally,underAmericanpres-",
  "sure, the Anglo-French alliance was forced to withdraw.51",
  "CloseontheheelsoftheinvasionofEgypt,SoviettanksrolledintoBud-",
  "apest. This followed a popular revolt which had overthrown the Soviet cli-",
  "ent regime in favour of a more representative government. Moscow reacted",
  "in brutal fashion to restore the status quo ante. Their action, like that of the",
  "British and the French in the Middle East, was viewed as an unacceptable in-",
  "fringement of national sovereignty.",
  "Indian commentators saw the invasions of Egypt and Hungary as wholly",
  "comparable. Both were \u2018acts of international brigandage by powers that com-",
  "manded permanent seats in the UN Security Council \u2013 both had \u2018spread a",
  "wave of cynicism throughout the world\u2019. As a Madras journal pointed out,",
  "while the independence of Egypt threatened the oil resources of Britain and",
  "France, \u2018the independence of Hungary would not only threaten the supply of",
  "uranium so essential for the maintenance of the Red Army in top form, but",
  "wouldcauseadangerousriftintheSovietempire.Londoncouldnotcounten-ance the first and Moscow could not tolerate the second. Hence their acts of",
  "nakedaggression whichamount toasavage exhibition ofthepredatory anim-",

  "Nehru had criticized the Anglo-French intervention as soon as it",
  "happened.53 But now, when the United Nations met to discuss a resolution",
  "callingupontheSovietUnion\u2018towithdrawallofitsforceswithoutdelayfrom",
  "Hungarian territory\u2019, India, represented by V. K. Krishna Menon, abstained.",
  "This caused great resentment in the Western world, and exposed the Indian",
  "government to the charge of keeping double standards.54",
  "There was also much domestic criticism of India\u2019s stand. There was an",
  "angry debate in Parliament, and sections of the press deplored \u2018our shame-",
  "ful sycophancy to the Soviet rulers . . .\u2019 \u2018By kowtowing to Russia we have",

  "After returning from London, Krishna Menon was made a Cabinet min-",
  "ister without portfolio. He became a sort of roving ambassador, representingIndia at the UN and at disarmament meetings in Geneva. A man of forceful",
  "opinions, he was controversial both in his homeland and out of it. The \u2018lucid-",
  "ity of his intellect\u2019, wrote one journalist who knew him well, \u2018is sometimes",
  "clouded by passions and resentments\u2019. Since his \u2018likes and dislikes are",
  "stronger than would seem quite safe for a man in his position\u2019, it did seem",

  "The Chinese leader had \u2018experienced many hardships and endured tremend-",

  "He thought that in view of the \u2018rebuff over Tibet, India should no longer ad-",

  "developments should prompt afresh reconsideration of \u2018our relationship with",
  "China, Russia, America, Britain and Burma\u2019. Patel seemed here to be hinting",
  "that India should reconsider its policy of non-alignment in favour of an alli-",
  "ance with the West.66",
  "This latter shift was advocated more vigorously by the journalist D. F.",
  "Karaka. Like Patel, Karaka was appalled by Pannikar\u2019s carelessness. (Appar-",
  "ently, the ambassador did not hear about the Chinese invasion until it was",
  "announced on All-India Radio.) The annexation of Tibet had shown that the",
  "Himalaya was no longer impregnable. And the Indian army lacked the equip-",
  "mentortrainingtotakeonadetermined andfocusedenemy.Thus,concluded",
  "Karaka, \u2018whatever may be our past unhappy relations with Britain, however",
  "much may be our fear of American imperialism spreading in Asia, we have",
  "to decide now whether we will continue with this policy of neutrality and en-",
  "danger our frontiers, or whether we will take the lesser risk and make a milit-",
  "ary pact with the United States and with Great Britain.\u201967",
  "Nehru would not deign to take notice of journalists such as Karaka. But",
  "he did answer Patel, in a note on the subject circulated to the Cabinet. He",
  "thought it a pity that Tibet could not be \u2018saved\u2019. Yet he considered it \u2018exceed-",
  "inglyunlikely\u2019thatIndiawouldnowfaceanattackfromChina;itwas\u2018incon-",
  "ceivable\u2019 that they would \u2018undertake a wild adventure across the Himalayas\u2019.",
  "He thought that \u2018the idea that communism inevitably means expansion and",
  "war, or to put it more precisely, that Chinese communism means inevitablyan expansion towards India, is rather naive\u2019. Regardless of the happenings in",
  "Tibet, India should still seek \u2018some kind of understanding\u2019 with Beijing, for",

  "The border in the centre was relatively uncontentious, whereas in the",
  "two extremes the situation was more problematic. The Chinese regarded the",
  "McMahon Line in particular as an imperialist imposition. For the moment",
  "they let the matter pass, and focused on getting India\u2019s goodwill, necessary at",
  "this time as a bridge to the Western world. In the summer of 1952 a govern-",
  "ment delegation led by Mrs Vijayalakshmi Pandit visited Beijing. Mrs Pan-",
  "dit had served as India\u2019s ambassador to Moscow; more to the point, she was",

  "a sense of humour which is terribly infectious. One has to join in his laughter",
  "\u2013 and he laughs often. He makes one feel at home in a moment and his con-",

  "The letter did strike the odd ambivalent note. \u2018We have been wined and",
  "dined\u2019, wrote Mrs Pandit, \u2018and have spoken of friendship and culture and",
  "peace until I am getting alittle tired.\u2019 And she wasn\u2019t sure whether the Great",
  "Helmsman reminded her more of Gandhi or of Stalin. For while \u2018Mao gives",
  "the impression of being kind and tolerant and wise\u2019, the \u2018tolerant part struck",
  "me almost as if it might be apose as it is reminiscent of the Russian lead-",
  "ers particularly Stalin. He uses the same gesture in greeting and has the same",
  "technique with the public. Still, what stood out was \u2018the great vitality of the",
  "people and the dedicated manner in which they are working. The oppressionone feels in Moscow is absent here. Everybody seems happy and determined",
  "to make the country prosperous\u2019.69",
  "Mrs Pandit seems to have reacted to China in 1952 much as her brother",
  "had reacted to Russia in 1927. Perhaps this dawn might not turn out to be a",
  "false one after all. So Nehru was inclined to think, too. Soon, romanticism",
  "was to be reinforced by realpolitik. The United States began to tilt markedly",
  "towards Pakistan, giving New Delhi one more reason to befriend Beijing. In",
  "a wide-ranging agreement signed in April 1954, India officially recognized",
  "Tibet as being part of China. The joint declaration outlined five principles of",
  "peaceful co-existence (panch sheel), which included mutual non-aggression",
  "and mutual respect for each other\u2019s territorial integrity.70",
  "One person who did not welcome this agreement was the former sec-",
  "retary general of the Foreign Ministry, Sir Girija Shankar Bajpai. Writing to",
  "acolleague, Bajpai warned that communist China was no\u2018different from Rus-",
  "sian Communism in its expansionist aims . . .\u2019 The current thinking in New",
  "Delhi was of \u2018the naturalness of indefinite continuance of indefinite peace",
  "and friendship between China and us\u2019. Bajpai feared that \u2018those on whom the",
  "P[rime] M[inister] now relies most for advice completely and vehemently re-",
  "ject any possibility of a change in what appears to be China\u2019s present policy",
  "of peace with its Asian neighbours\u2019.71",
  "ItisunlikelythatthiswarningreachedNehru,andevenifithadhewould",
  "most likely have disregarded it. Towards the end of 1954 he visited China for",
  "the first time. As in Russia six months later, huge crowds were mobilized to",
  "greet the visitor, who appreciated this \u2018tremendous emotional response from",
  "the Chinese people . Nehru had discussions with Chou En-lai about border",
  "questions, and with Mao about the world situation. He also pressed the case",
  "forTibetan autonomy,the Chinese assuring him in the Dalai Lama\u2019spresence",
  "thattheBuddhiststatewouldenjoyastatuswhich\u2018nootherprovinceenjoyed",
  "in the People\u2019s Republic of China\u2019.72",
  "On his return from China Nehru addressed a mammoth public meeting",
  "on the Calcutta Maidan. A million people heard him affirm that \u2018the people",
  "of China do not want war\u2019; they were too busy uniting their country and get-",
  "ting rid of poverty. He spoke admiringly of the spirit of unity in China, the",
  "absence of the provincial and sectarian interests that bedevilled India. As for",
  "the \u2018mighty welcome\u2019 he had received in the People\u2019s Republic, this was \u2018not",
  "because Iam Jawaharlal with any special ability, but because I am the Prime",
  "Minister of India for which the Chinese people cherish in their hearts the",
  "greatest of love and with which they want to maintain the friendliest of rela-",
  "tions\u2019.73Two years later the compliment was returned when Chou En-lai visited",
  "India. With him were the Dalai and Panchen Lamas, who had been invited as",
  "part of the celebrations of the 2500th birth anniversary of the Buddha. On a",
  "drive through the countryside the Dalai Lama escaped his Chinese minders",
  "and travelled with Nehru. A revolt was brewing in Tibet against the occupi-",
  "ers, he said; he himself was strongly tempted to seek asylum in India. If that",
  "wasnotpossible,atleastIndiacouldsendaconsultoLhasawhowasnotpro-",
  "Chinese or pro-communist. When Nehru asked Chou about the situation in",

  "there, and promised to look into them.74",
  "So there the matter rested. The Dalai Lama went back to Lhasa, and",
  "India and China continued to be brothers-in-arms; as the slogan of the time",
  "went,Hindi-Chinibhai-bhai.Themanmostresponsibleforthiswasthecharm-",

  "far, the veteran politician C. Rajagopalachari. \u2018Rajaji\u2019 had lunch with the",
  "Chinese prime minister and later wrote to a friend that, \u2018frankly my impres-",
  "sion was very favourable. Apart from the general thawing of all communists",
  "the Chinese Premier is I believe agood type of man and trustworthy.75",
  "In public India and China expressed undying friendship, buton the",

  "cerned with the eastern sector; China with the western one. The British had",
  "drawntheMcMahonLinetoprotecttheprosperousteaestatesoftheprovince",
  "of Assam from a putative raid down the Himalaya. There was an \u2018Inner Line",
  "at the foot of the hills, beyond which no one could venture without a permit.",
  "Between this and the border lay some 50,000 square miles of densely fores-",
  "ted territory, inhabited by many self-contained and self-administered tribes,",
  "each too small to form a separate state, each too remote to be subservient to",
  "any existing one. Some of the tribes were Buddhist, and there was also an old",
  "Buddhist monastery at Tawang. This paid tribute to Tibetan authorities and",
  "was \u2018ecclesiastically subject\u2019 to Lhasa.",
  "Underthetreatyof1914,theBritishpersuadedtheTibetanstorelinquish",

  "Other tribes living between the Inner and Outer Lines were beyond",
  "Tibetan influence. These, like the Buddhists, became Indian citizens by de-",
  "fault in August 1947, when the new government inherited the borders be-",
  "queathed it by the British. Slowly, New Delhi moved to fill in the admin-istrative vacuum that the British had left behind. In February 1951 a small",
  "force accompanied by apolitical officer visited Tawang, and instructed the la-",
  "mas that they need no longer pay tribute to Lhasa. Officials also began to",
  "fan out into what was now called the North-East Frontier Agency, or NEFA.",
  "AnIndianFrontierAdministrativeService(IFAS)wasformed,whoserecruits",
  "were coached on how best to deal with the sometimes truculent tribes by the",
  "British-bornanthropologistVerrierElwin,whowasnowanIndiancitizenand",
  "a confidant of Nehru.77",
  "The Chinese, for their part, focused on expanding their footprint in the",
  "western sector. Here, too, the adjoining Indian territory, known as Ladakh,",
  "was Buddhist in its religious colouring. However, it had been an independent",
  "state as early as the tenth century. And for the past 150 years it had been part",
  "of the principality of Kashmir, whose own allegiances were all to the Indian",
  "side of the border.",
  "Between north-east Ladakh and Sinkiang, on the Chinese side, lay an el-",
  "evated table-land named Aksai Chin, \u2018absolutely bare\u2019 for the most part, with",
  "occasional patches of \u2018scant herbage\u2019.78 In the past, Ladakhi pastoralists had",
  "used Aksai Chin for grazing and salt collection. By an agreement of 1842",
  "this area was identified as being part of Kashmir. This was confirmed by the",
  "British, who were worried that the Russians, their adversary in the \u2018Great",
  "Game\u2019,might use the plateau to advance heavy artillery into British India.",
  "That didn\u2019t happen, but after 1950 the Chinese saw in the same flat ter-",
  "rain a route to their troublesome province of Tibet from the Sinkiang town",
  "of Yarkand. Peking sent surveyors to scout the land, and in 1956 began",
  "buildingaroad across Aksai Chin. By October 1957 the road was ready,",
  "equipped to carry 10-ton military trucks with arms and personnel from",
  "Yarkand to Lhasa.",
  "We owe this information to accounts published much later. At the time,",
  "however, the Chinese activities in the west, and the Indian activities in the",
  "east, were carried on out of each other\u2019s gaze. To the world at large, and to",
  "their owncitizens, thetwoAsian neighbourswereboundbyanexemplary re-",
  "lationship of friendship and co-operation.",
  "VI",
  "\u2018If there were ever two countries where every prospect promised brotherly",
  "understanding and friendship\u2019, wrote a Bombay newspaper in January 1952,\u2018these two are India and Pakistan. Every possible kind of tie exists between",
  "them; the tie of race, the ties of language, of geography, economy and cul-",
  "ture.79",
  "Yet India\u2019s relations with Pakistan were poisoned from the start. The",
  "country had been divided against a backdrop of violence; and the mutual sus-",
  "picion and hostility persisted. In the winter of 1949/50 there was a wave of",
  "communal riots in East Pakistan. Several hundred thousand Hindus crossed",
  "over the border into India. Nehru now suggested to his Pakistani counterpart,",
  "Liaqat Ali Khan, that they together visit the affected areas to bring about",
  "peace. His offer was declined; but Khan agreed to come to Delhi and sign",
  "an agreement binding both countries to the humane treatment of their re-",
  "spective minorities. However, the \u2018Nehru-Liaqat\u2019 pact failed to stem the tide",
  "of refugees. There was much anger among Hindus in West Bengal, some of",
  "whom even wanted the government to go to war with Pakistan on their be-",
  "half.80",
  "The two main conflicts, however, were about those elemental human",
  "needs,landandwater.Thefirst,whichthisbookhasalreadyalludedtoandto",
  "which it will return, related to the unresolved status of Kashmir. The second",
  "pertainedtothefairuseoftheIndusanditsfivemaintributaries.Theserivers",
  "ran from east to west, that is, from India towards Pakistan. The Indus and the",
  "JhelumenteredPakistanbeforeanymajorextractionwaspossible,buttheoth-",
  "er four rivers ran for many miles in Indian territory. This made it possible for",
  "India to regulate their flow and impound water before the rivers reached the",
  "other country.",
  "After Partition, the governments of East and West Punjab signed a",
  "\u2018StandstillAgreement\u2019wherebywatercontinuedtoflowuninterrupted.When",
  "this lapsed, in April 1948, India stopped the waters of the Ravi and the Sutlej",

  "the farmers of West Punjab. Within a month a newagreement was signed, and",
  "water supply restored. However, the building of the Bhakra-Nangal dam, on",
  "the Indian side of the Sutlej river, prompted fresh protests by Pakistan.",
  "Both sides now sought amore permanent solution to the problem.",
  "Pakistan asked for the matter to be referred to international arbitration, which",
  "India at first refused. The World Bank stepped in to play the role of peace-",
  "maker. Knowing the recalcitrance of both sides, the Bank offered a surgical",
  "solution \u2013 the waters of three rivers would go to Pakistan, the waters of theother three rivers to India. This proposal was tabled in February 1954; it took",
  "another six years for the two sides to finally sign it.81",
  "With the Indus, as with Kashmir or any other topic under the subcontin-",
  "ental sun,agreement was made more difficult bydomestic politics. AnIndian",
  "or Pakistani head of government who promoted dialogue was inevitably ac-",
  "cused of selling out to the other side. An early example of this was the trade",
  "war of 1949\u201351, prompted by the devaluation of the Indian rupee. Pakistan",
  "stopped the shipment of jute in protest; India retaliated by refusing to supply-",
  "coal.82 The conflict was resolved only when, in February 1951, Nehru agreed",
  "to recognize the par value of the Pakistani rupee. His decision was welcomed",
  "by chambers of commerce, but bitterly opposed by politicians of all stripes.",
  "The general consensus in New Delhi was that \u2018India has been completely de-",
  "feated\u2019. One Congress member reported that the feeling in the party office",
  "wasthat\u2018suchahumiliationcouldnothavebeenpossibleifSardarPatelwere",
  "alive\u2019. A refugee leader remarked, \u2018The real question to be considered now",
  "is to find out the next issue on which Jawaharlal will surrender to Pakistan",
  "\u2013 Kashmir, or more probably Evacuee Property\u2019. A spokesman of the Hindu",
  "Mahasabha said, \u2018In order to become a world leader, Nehru can go to the ex-",
  "tent of surrendering the whole of India to Pakistan.\u2019 And an RSS organizer",
  "claimed,\u2018Thisshowswhatistocomenext.Moreappeasementandsurrenders",
  "if the masses do not check Nehru.83",
  "On the Pakistani side, any concession to India was likewise seen by",
  "opposition politicians as appeasement of the enemy. At the popular level,",
  "however, the feelings about the other side were distinctly mixed. Nationalist",
  "ideology drove them apart; but mass culture brought them back together",
  "again. It was not just that they ate the same food and lived in the same kinds",
  "of homes. They also had the same sense of fun. Indian filmstars were widely",
  "admired in Pakistan; and Pakistani cricketers given arousing reception when",
  "they played in India.",
  "This ambivalence is captured in an exchange printed by the Karachi",
  "newspaper Dawn in 1955. A lady who had recently visited her relatives in In-",
  "dia wrote of her experiences while travelling by train from Amritsar to Am-",
  "bala. When they heard she was from Pakistan, she was set upon by passen-",
  "gers who were refugees from Sindh and West Punjab. Apparently, \u2018some of",
  "the non-refugee Hindu passengers remonstrated, but the refugee Hindus and",
  "Sikhs brushed aside their remonstrance, saying that the non-refugees could",

  "Indian foreign policy was opposed to the continuance of colonial rule any-",
  "where. This, naturally, meant reclaiming the pieces of the motherland that",
  "were still under the control of foreigners. When the British left in 1947, the",
  "Portuguese stayed on in Goa and their other possessions in India while the",
  "Frenchremainedincontrolofthreesliversoflandinthesouth\u2013mostimport-",

  "agore.",
  "In June 1949 the population of Chandernagore voted by an over-whelm-",
  "ing majority to merge withIndia. The electionhad witnessed a resounding dis-",
  "play of patriotism, with posters representing a mother in Indian dress reach-",
  "ing out to reclaim a child clad in Western apparel. A year later the territory",
  "was transferred. But the French hung on to their slices of south India. In the",
  "spring of 1954 the situation became \u2018increasingly tense\u2019; there was a vigor-",
  "ous pro-merger movement afoot in Pondicherry, and daily demonstrations in",
  "front of the French consulate in Madras. On 1 November the French finally",
  "handed over their territories, which the Indians celebrated with a spectacu-",
  "lardisplayoffireworks.ThefollowingJanuary\u2019sannualRepublicDayparade",
  "for the first time featured a float from Pondicherry, with young girls singing",
  "French songs.85",
  "In welcoming back these fragments, Jawaharlal Nehru praised the gov-",
  "ernments of both countries for their \u2018tolerance, good sense and wisdom\u2019, thus",
  "solving the problem of French India \u2018with grace and goodwill\u2019.86 These re-",
  "marks were intended above all for the Portuguese, who, however, were not",
  "listening. They were determined to hang on to Goa for as long as they could.",
  "As the transfer of Pondicherry was being finalized, the Portuguese dictator",
  "Antonio de Oliveira Salazar spoke on national radio of their Indian colonies",
  "as belonging to \u2018the Portuguese Nation by injunction of History and force ofLaw\u2019. \u2018Goa constitutes a Portuguese community in India\u2019, he insisted: \u2018Goa",
  "represents alight of the West in lands of the Orient. It had to be retained, so",
  "that it might \u2018continue to be the memorial of Portuguese discoveries and a",
  "small hearth of the spirit of the West in the East\u2019.87",
  "A Goa Congress Committee had been in operation since well before",
  "Independence; its activists included resident Goans as well as exiles in Bom-",
  "bay. They argued that the conditions in Goa were far worse than in British",
  "India; racial prejudice was rife and human rights wholly absent. In 1946 the",
  "left-wing Congress politician Rammanohar Lohia visited the territory and ex-",
  "horted the people to rise against the rulers. A wave of strikes and protests fol-",
  "lowed; these were crushed by the authorities. On 15 August 1947 the Indian",
  "tricolour was hoisted here and there, but the protesters were quickly taken",
  "away by the police.88",
  "Apart from Goa, the Portuguese also held several smaller territories up",
  "theKonkancoast.OnewasDaman,whichhadagarrisonof1,500Africansol-",
  "diers from Portuguese East Africa. This abutted the Indian province of Bom-",
  "bay, which after Independence had imposed prohibition. There was now a",
  "flourishing trade in the smuggling of liquor. On Sunday evenings the frontier",
  "between Daman andBombay was\u2018strewnwithpilgrims toBacchus, wending",
  "their way back to the land where they belong, back to Bharat, land of scarcity",
  "and austerity.89",

  "that the matter would be resolved by dialogue. But his hand was being forced",
  "byradicalsoftheSocialistParty,whobeganaseriesofsatyagrahastocompel",
  "Goa to join the union. In July 1954 a group of activists from Bombay seized",
  "the tiny enclave of Dadra. The next month the somewhat bigger enclave of",
  "Nagar-Haveli also fell without a fight. Then 1,000 volunteers attempted to",
  "cross over to Daman on Independence Day. They were stopped by the Indi-",
  "an police, whereupon they wired the prime minister for support. Nehru wired",
  "back saying that such a showdown would not \u2018help our cause\u2019.90",

  "ICSandmakingfreshselectionsfromtheyoung.AjobintheIFShadanearly",
  "uniquecombinationofidealismandglamour;italsoofferedthechanceofper-",
  "sonal contact with the prime minister. One IFS officer recalled how, early in",
  "1948, Nehru called him to his room and showed him a map of the world. The",
  "prime minister\u2019s eyes ranged over the globe, and his fingers pointed to places",
  "north,south,eastandwest.\u2018Wewillhavefortyembassies!\u2019heexclaimed.\u2018We",
  "will have forty missions!\u201992",
  "Five years later, when India did have forty missions, Nehru wrote them",
  "all a letter of self-congratulation. The \u2018prestige of India has greatly increased",
  "since Independence, he said, for \u2018we have always avoided playing a flashy",
  "role in international affairs . . . Gradually, an appreciation has grown in other",
  "countries of our own sincerity of purpose even though there has been dis-",
  "agreement. He asked all those representing India abroad \u2013 \u2018from the Head of",
  "the Mission to the humblest employee\u2019 \u2013 to \u2018feel and work as ahappy fam-",
  "ily,cooperating with each other . . .",
  "We are all partners in a great adventure, and are all partners and comrades in",
  "the same undertaking.\u201993",
  "Although presented and carried out as a collective enterprise, this partic-",
  "ular adventure had \u2018made by the prime minister\u2019 stamped all over it. In 1950,",
  "one of his most intelligent and least sycophantic cabinet ministers spoke of",
  "howNehruwasbecoming\u2018thebiggestmanintheworld,overtoppingtheUSA",
  "men,theUKmenandeveryotherman\u2019.Throughitsleader,acountry\u2018without",
  "material, men or money \u2013the three means of power \u2013 was \u2018now fast coming",
  "to be recognized as the biggest moral power in the civilized world . . . her",
  "word listened to with respect in the councils of the great\u2019.94 Even opposition",
  "politicians appreciated what Nehru had done for India\u2019s international stand-",
  "ing. Non-alignment seemed to them to be acreative application of Gandhian",
  "principles in world affairs. Confidence in its viability was strengthened when",
  "Indiawascalled upontoplayanimportant mediatory roleintheconflicts and",
  "civil wars of the time.",
  "Intelligent foreigners also praised Nehru\u2019s non-alignment. When that",
  "now great publishing firm, Feltrinelli of Milan, began operationsin 1955, one",
  "of the first two books it published was Nehru\u2019s autobiography, which it cel-ebrated both for its \u2018consistent and coherent anti-fascism\u2019 and as an authen-",
  "tic voice of \u2018the countries that were emerging from colonial domination . . .",
  "to take their place forcefully in the global political system\u2019.95 And from her",
  "post in the Swedish embassy in New Delhi, Alva Myrdal wrote to her hus-",

  "Such was Nehru\u2019s standing among the people of the front-line states",
  "in the Cold War, those who stood between the United States and the Soviet",
  "Union. In 1955 non-alignment still had a glow and moral halo about it. The",
  "next year was the Hungary fiasco, and the beginning of the Western disillu-",
