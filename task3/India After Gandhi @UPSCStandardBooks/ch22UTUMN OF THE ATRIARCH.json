  "Theministers,unthinkingandbleary-eyed,wereinformedofthestateofemer-",
  "gency, in effect since midnight. Their formal consent was obtained before Mrs",
  "Gandhi proceeded to the studios of All-India Radio (AIR) to convey the news",
  "to an equally unsuspecting nation. \u2018The President has proclaimed Emergency\u2019,",
  "she announced: \u2018There is nothing to panic about.\u2019 This, she said, was a neces-",
  "sary response to \u2018the deep and widespread conspiracy which has been brewing",
  "ever since I began to introduce certain progressive measures of benefit to the",
  "common man and woman of India.\u2019 \u2018Forces of disintegration\u2019 and \u2018communal",
  "passions\u2019 were threatening the unity of India. \u2018This is not a personal matter,\u2019",
  "she claimed. \u2018It is not important whether I remain Prime Minister or not.\u2019 Still,",
  "she hoped that conditions would \u2018speedily improve to enable us to dispense",
  "with this Proclamation as soon as possible\u2019.1",
  "The disclaimers betray a certain defensiveness. For the fact was that the",
  "emergency had come hot on the heels of the Supreme Court order forbidding",
  "her from voting in Parliament. When the emergency was declared, the prime",
  "minister\u2019s closest friend, the designer Pupul Jayakar, was away in the United",
  "States. On the 27th Mrs Gandhi sent Mrs Jayakar along note, explaining that",
  "theactionwastakeninresponsetothe\u2018increasing violence\u2019 causedbya\u2018cam-",
  "paign of hate and calumny\u2019. The number of arrests, she claimed, were a mere",
  "900, most detainees kept not in jail but \u2018comfortably, in houses\u2019. The \u2018general",
  "public reaction\u2019 was \u2018good\u2019, and there was \u2018tranquillity all over the country\u2019.",
  "The emergency, the prime minister told her friend, was \u2018intended to enable are",
  "turn to normal democratic functioning\u2019.2",
  "Across India people were being picked up and put into jails. These in-",
  "cluded leaders and legislators of parties other than the Congress, student act-ivists,tradeunionists,indeed,anyonewiththeslightestconnectiontotheJana",
  "Sangh, the Congress (O), the Socialists, or other groups opposed to the ruling",

  "Inthefirstfewmonthsoftheemergency,theprimeministergaveaflurry",
  "of interviews defending its proclamation. These too displayed a deep defens-",
  "iveness. It is wholly wrong to say that I resorted to Emergency to keep my-",
  "self in office,\u2019 she told the Sunday Times of London. \u2018The extra-constitution-",
  "al challenge [of the JP movement] was constitutionally met.\u2019 The emergency",
  "was \u2018declared to save the country from disruption and collapse\u2019; it had \u2018en-",
  "abled us to put through the new economic programme\u2019, and led to \u2018a new",
  "sense of national confidence\u2019. \u2018What has been done\u2019, she told the Saturday",
  "ReviewofNewYork,\u2018isnotanabrogationofdemocracybutanefforttosafe-",
  "guard it\u2019. In these interviews she attacked the Western press for \u2018India-bait-",
  "ing\u2019,forpickingonhercountryinpreferencetomorevisiblyauthoritarianna-",
  "tions such as Pakistan andChina.4",
  "In her interviews and broadcasts the prime minister spoke of the need",
  "to infuse a \u2018new spirit of discipline and morale\u2019. The government\u2019s copy-",
  "writers were put to work, coining slogans such as \u2018Discipline Makes the Na-",
  "tion Great\u2019, \u2018Talk Less, Work More\u2019, \u2018Be Indian, Buy Indian\u2019, \u2018Efficiency is",
  "our Watchword\u2019. Other exhortations were less impersonal, such as She Stood",
  "between Order and Chaos\u2019 and \u2018Courage and Clarity of Vision, Thy Name",
  "is Indira Gandhi\u2019. Rendered in Hindi as well as English, these slogans were",
  "painted on the sides of buses, across bridges and on outsize hoardings erected",
  "outside government buildings.",
  "These were the signs of a creeping dictatorship. Like military men who",
  "seizepowerviaacoup,MrsGandhiclaimedtohaveactedtosavethecountry",
  "from itself. And, like them, she went on to say that, while she had denied",
  "her people freedom, she would give them bread in exchange. Within a week",
  "of the emergency she was offering a \u2018Twenty Point Programme for Econom-",
  "ic Progress\u2019. This promised a reduction in prices of essential commodities,",
  "the speedy implementation of land reforms, the abolition of indebtedness andof bonded labour, higher wages for workers and lower taxes for the middle",
  "class.5",
  "Female dictators are altogether rare \u2013 in the twentieth century Mrs",

  "She spoke for over an hour, on the need for discipline, on her economic pro-",
  "gramme, on the glories of ancient India and the duties of its modern citizens.",
  "\u2018Our opponents\u2019 wanted to \u2018paralyse the work of the Central Government\u2019,",
  "said the Prime Minister, and thus",
  "wefoundourselvesinaserioussituation.Andwetookcertainsteps.But",
  "many of the friends in the country were rather puzzled as to what has",
  "Indiraji done?What will happentothecountrynow?Butwefelt that the",
  "country has developed a disease and, if it is to be cured soon, it has to",
  "be given a dose of medicine even if it is a bitter dose. However dear a",
  "child may be, if the doctor has prescribed bitter pills for him, they have",
  "to be administered for his cure . . . So we gave this bitter medicine to the",
  "nation.",
  ". . . Now, when a child suffers, the mother suffers too. Thus we were",

  "out of one person was not just in deference to his leadership of the opposi-",
  "tional movement in India. The prime movers of the \u2018Free JP Campaign\u2019 had",
  "known him from long before he launched his \u2018Total Revolution\u2019. The left-",
  "wing Labourites, such as Brockway, had known him from the 1930s, as a",
  "great hero of the independence movement. The environmentalists, such as E.",
  "F. Schumacher, had known him from the 1950s, as alike-minded votary of",
  "decentralized development. The political scientists had known him from be-",
  "fore and after Independence, as an ever-present, always influential exemplar",
  "of what Morris-Jones had called the \u2018saintly idiom\u2019 in Indian politics.",
  "These foreign friends of India\u2019s freedom were old enough to have seen",
  "how close Jawaharlal Nehru and Jayaprakash Narayan had once been. They",
  "were appalled that Nehru\u2019s daughter had jailed JP, and hoped that an appeal",
  "to history would take him out of prison. So did that great group of pacifists,",
  "the Quakers, who did not put their name to the Times advertisement but tried",
  "the back-channels of reconciliation instead. The group had an old and hon-",
  "ourable connection with India. Quakers such as Agatha Harrison and Horace",
  "Alexander had played crucial intermediary roles between British colonialists",
  "andIndian nationalists. Morerecently,they hadworkedwith JPinattempting",
  "reconciliation between India and Pakistan and between the Naga rebels and",
  "the government in New Delhi.",
  "InAugust,amonthaftertheemergencywasdeclared,thesociologistJoe",
  "Elder was sent by his fellow Quakers on a fact-finding mission to India. He",
  "metmanypeople;JP\u2019sfollowers,Congresspoliticiansandtheprimeminister.",
  "He found himself \u2018decreasingly prone to condemn one side or the other\u2019.JP",
  "had erred in launching a mass movement without a cadre of disciplined, non-",
  "violent volunteers. His ideas had \u2018struck many as naive, untested, or uncon-",
  "vincing\u2019. His movement\u2019s credibility was weakened by the presence within",
  "it of extremists of left and right. On the other hand, the prime minister had",
  "clearly over-reacted in imposing the emergency. This had created fear in the",
  "minds of the people, and undermined the democratic process and democratic",
  "institutions.7",
  "AsElder\u2019saccountsuggests,theemergencywasascriptjointlyauthored",
  "by JP and Mrs Gandhi. Both had shown too little faith in representative insti-",
  "tutions:JPbyaskingfortheprematuredismissalofelectedgovernments,Mrs",
  "Gandhi by jailing legally elected members of Parliament and legislative as-",
  "semblies.Neitherproperlyappreciatedtheroleofthestateinamoderndemo-cracy. JP wished simply for the state to disappear, for the police and army to",
  "\u2018disobey immoral orders\u2019. On the other hand, Mrs Gandhi sought to make the",
  "state\u2019s functionaries ultimately dependent on the will of a single person at the",
  "helm.",
  "The clash was made poignant by the fact that the adversaries had once",
  "been friends, bound by ties of history and tradition and by intimate personal",
  "relationships stretching across generations. One does not know how Mrs",
  "Gandhi felt about jailing JP. We do know that her staff had deeply ambivalent",
  "feelings.Theprimeminister\u2019sInformationAdviser,H.Y.SharadaPrasad,was",
  "an old patriot and freedom-fighter himself. He had been jailed in 1942, in",
  "the same Quit India campaign that first made JP a national figure. Unlike Joe",
  "Elder, he could not bring himself to admit that the prime minister had over-",
  "reacted. Yet, as he wrote to a friend, he grieved that a man like JP, \u2018at a mo-",
  "ment ofcrucial ethical importance, decide[d] that RSSandCPMaremoreac-",
  "ceptable than the Congress. This is an excursion in reasoning that I have not",
  "beenabletounderstand,muchlessexcuse.Icanonlyconsolemyselfwiththe",

  "been alive.\u20198",
  "Also unhappy about JP\u2019s incarceration was the economist P. N. Dhar,",
  "who had succeeded P. N. Haksar as the prime minister\u2019s principal secretary.",
  "He sent several emissaries to JP to see whether a conciliation could be effec-",
  "ted,withprisonersreleasedandtheemergencylifted,intimeforthenextpar-",
  "liamentary elections, due in early 1976. The emissaries found JP willing to",
  "negotiate. Afloodinhisnative Bihar hadmade himimpatient togoandwork",
  "among the sufferers. Talk that his irresponsibility had caused the emergency",
  "had reached his ears. He said he had no desire to revive the popular move-",
  "ment, but when elections were called would ask for a combined front to op-",
  "pose the Congress, and canvass for its candidates.9",
  "JP was keen that his old friend Sheikh Abdullah, now also a part of the",
  "Indian establishment as chief minister of Jammu and Kashmir, be the medi-",
  "ator between him and Mrs Gandhi. He had read a report quoting the Sheikh",
  "as saying that he was in favour of \u2018conciliation at All-India level\u2019, and that",
  "the prime minister was \u2018more than keen to end the emergency\u2019. JP now wrote",
  "to Abdullah offering him his \u2018full co-operation\u2019 in any move he might make",
  "to resolve the differences between the opposition and the government. That",
  "said, the letter betrayed signs of wounds still not healed, as in JP\u2019s reference",
  "tohimselfbeingportrayedas\u2018thevillainofthepiece,thearch-conspirator,the",
  "culprit number one\u2019, and in his concluding challenge that \u2018the first test of [theprime minister\u2019s] keenness [to end the emergency] will be whether this letter",
  "is allowed to be delivered to you and whether you are permitted to see me\u2019.10",
  "The prime minister failed the test. The letter was not passed on to the",
  "Sheikh, and the moves to effect a reconciliation died with it. However, in",
  "November1975JP\u2019shealthtookaturnfortheworse.Withhiskidneysfailing,",
  "he was taken to a hospital in Chandigarh and, when the doctors there proved",
  "unequal to the task, released on parole and shifted to the Jaslok Hospital in",
  "Bombay, to be placed under the care of the nephrologist M. K. Mani. The",
  "government\u2019s action was hastened by the realization that all hell might break",
  "loose if JP were to die in jail.11",
  "Although JP lay in a Bombay bed, chained to a dialysis machine, there",
  "wasnogeneralparoleofpoliticalprisoners.Anestimated36,000peoplewere",

  "common criminals \u2013 in fact, made to share their cells with them (prompting",
  "thewitticismthatMrsGandhi\u2019smuchvauntedsocialismwasatleastpractised",
  "in the jails). Older prisoners looked nostalgically back to the days of the Raj,",
  "when the jails had been cleaner and the jailers altogether more humane. It",
  "seemed that women prisoners were singled out for special treatment. The Ra-",
  "jmatas of Gwalior and Jaipur were now living in conditions of unaccustomed",
  "austerityandfilth.ThesocialistMrinalGore,moreusedtothesimplelife,was",
  "asked to share a toilet with the woman in the adjoining cell \u2013 who happened",

  "\u2018not only throws up the mediocre person but gives strength to the most vocal",
  "howsoevertheymaylackknowledgeandunderstand-ing\u2019.14Threeyearslater,",
  "when she had just become prime minister, Mrs Gandhi told a visiting journal-",
  "ist that \u2018the Congress has become moribund\u2019, adding, \u2018Sometimes I feel that",
  "even the parliamentary system has become moribund.\u2019 Besides, the \u2018inertia",
  "of our civil service is incredible\u2019; we have a system of dead wood replacingdead wood\u2019. \u2018Sometimes I wish\u2019, said the newly elected prime minister of the",

  "Theimpatiencewithdemocraticprocedurehadbeenmanifestedearly,as",
  "for instance with the packing of the civil service, the judiciary and the Con-",
  "gress Party with individuals committed to the prime minister. But the pro-",
  "cess was taken much further with the emergency. Now, with opposition MPs",
  "locked away, a series of constitutional amendments were passed to prolong",
  "Mrs Gandhi\u2019s rule. The 38th Amendment, passed on 22 July 1975, barred ju-",
  "dicial review of the emergency. The 39th Amendment, introduced two weeks",
  "later, stated that the election of the prime minister could not be challenged",
  "by the Supreme Court, but only by a body constituted by Parliament. This",
  "came just in time to help Mrs Gandhi in her election review petition, where",
  "the Court now held that there was no case to try, since the new amendment",
  "retrospectivelyrenderedheractionsduringthe1971electionsoutsidethepur-",

  "the right of habeas corpus could not be taken away by the state. Judgements",
  "in the lower courts seemed to favour this view, but when the case reached the",
  "Supreme Court it held that detentions without trial were legal under the new",
  "dispensation. Of the five-member bench only one dissented: this was Justice",
  "H. R. Khanna, who pointed out that \u2018detention without trial is an anathema to",
  "all those who love personal liberty\u2019.17",

  "IV",
  "Among the casualties of the emergency was the freedom of the press. Within",
  "its first week the government had instituted a system of \u2018pre-censorship\u2019,",
  "whereby editors had to submit, for scrutiny and approval, material deemed to",
  "be critical of the government or its functionaries. Guidelines were issued on",
  "what did and did not constitute \u2018news\u2019. There could be no reports on proces-",
  "sionsorstrikes,orofpoliticalopposition,orofconditionsinthejails.Reports",
  "ofopendissidencewerenaturallyverboten,butinfactevenstoriesmildlycrit-",
  "ical of the administration were not permitted.21 As a newspaper in the Punjab",
  "was to recall, items \u2018killed\u2019 by the censor included",
  "reports about the closure of shops in Chandigarh\u2019s Bajwara market to",
  "protestagainstthearrestofshopkeepers,thesix-yearabsenceofahealth",
  "officer and observations about the town\u2019s sanitation, especially the open",
  "drains; . . . three letters to the editor about pay anomalies and inadequate",
  "salary scales of college lectures in Himachal Pradesh; an unsatisfactory",
  "bus service; a Chandigarh report about the rise in the price of tomatoes;",
  "the death of two persons while patrolling the rail tracks near Amritsar;",
  "and a brief item about black-marketing in essential drugs.22",
  "The space had to be filled; and it was, by the words of the prime minister or",
  "by stories in praise of her government. (Editors who tried to print the liberty-",
  "loving essays of Tagore, Gandhi and Nehru instead were quickly brought tobook.) \u2018Our newspapers, of course, give world news all right\u2019, wrote a read-",
  "er in Simla to an English friend, \u2018but hardly any other news pertaining to the",
  "country itself, except the speeches of the PM . . . I have decided to forgo the",
  "pleasures of reading a newspaper.\u201923 In truth, the disgust was shared by the",
  "journalists themselves. As a reporter for the Bombay weekly Blitz told his",
  "Englishfriend:\u2018MypaperisasupporteroftheEmergency.Butifweonlysing",
  "the praises of the Government, what will our readers think of us?\u201924",
  "Jokes tinged with satire were especially forbidden. The Tamil humorist",
  "Cho Ramaswamy failed to sneak in a cartoon showing the prime minister",
  "and her son Sanjay talking above the caption: \u2018A national debate on the Con-",
  "stitutional Amendments\u2019. When a reader asked the question, \u2018Who is Indira",
  "Gandhi\u2019, Cho answered: \u2018She is the granddaughter of Motilal Nehru, the",
  "daughter of Jawaharlal Nehru, and the mother of Sanjay Gandhi\u2019. This, too,",
  "was cut. The censors were vigilant, but the odd joke or two escaped their eye.",

  "As the emergency proceeded, the government tightened its hold over",
  "the dissemination of information. The independent news agencies, the United",
  "News of India (UNI) and the Press Trust of India (PTI), were amalgamated",
  "with two lesser agencies into a single state-controlled news service called",
  "Samachar. The Press Council, an autonomous watchdog body, was abolished.",

  "vours from those deemed critical of the government. More than one news pa-",
  "per, and editor, and owner, was happy to change its tune in response to the",
  "inducements on offer.27Among the major newspapers that willingly complied with the new reg-",
  "ulations were the Hindu, the Times of India and, especially, the Hindustan",
  "Times. The editor of the last-named newspaper, the hugely respected B. G.",

  "This calm was in sharp contrast to the strife-filled decade that preceded",

  "One fact is conclusive proof of the quiescence of the middle class \u2013",
  "that hardly any officials resigned in protest against the emergency. Back in",
  "the days of British rule, Gandhi\u2019s call to \u2018non-cooperate\u2019 with the rulers led",
  "to thousands of resignations of teachers, lawyers, judges, even ICS officers.",
  "Now, the abrogation of democracy was protested by only a handful of people",
  "in state employment. These included Fali Nariman, who resigned as addition-",
  "al solicitor general, M. L. Dantwala, who declined to continue as an adviser",
  "to the Reserve Bank, and Bagaram Tulpule, who left his high position in a",
  "public-sector undertaking.",
  "There was, however, some resistance offered in the Indian Parliament.",
  "On 23 July the House met to ratify the emergency. The Congress commanded",
  "a comfortable majority; and 34 MPs were in jail. Those opposition MPs atlibertytoattendmadespeechesofprotestbeforewalkingout.TheCPMmem-",

  "an independent member who continued to attend was P. G. Mavalankar of",

  "So he stayed and, when given the chance, quoted the Holy Trinity of Indian",

  "(People\u2019s Struggle Committee) began a satyagraha in Bombay. Every day a",

  "as\u2018DownwithDictatorship\u2019and\u2018JPZindabad\u2019.Withinamonth1,359people",
  "had been arrested \u2013 including 146 women. The protests spread to other states,",
  "where busstands, railway stations and government offices became the theatre",

  "One of those arrested in the Bombay satyagraha was the distinguished",
  "Marathi writer Durga Bhagwat. Other members of her fraternity protested in",
  "ways more congenial to their profession. A group of Kannada writers circu-",
  "lated, in samizdat form, poems satirizing the emergency and its prime mover.",
  "Consider these stanzas from G. S. Shivarudrappa\u2019s poem \u2018In this Country\u2019:In this country",
  "Hero worship, family pride",

  "Everybody should shut their mouth",
  "And remain quiet.",

  "They better keep their ears open",

  "Other writers expressed their dissent in other ways. Bengali essayist Annada",
  "Sankar Ray announced that he would \u2018stop writing altogether in A fit of non-",
  "cooperative pique\u2019. He refused to \u2018put pen to paper so long as the state of",
  "emergency continues\u2019. The cartoonist K. Shankar Pillai, who had once sar-",
  "castically compared the loquacious Nehru to the Niagara Falls (and been",

  "the years of Hitler, there never was a good comedy, not a good cartoon, not",

  "Padma Shri bestowed upon him by the government of India, the act recall-",
  "ing Tagore\u2019s disavowal of his knighthood after the Jallianwala Bagh massac-",
  "re. And the Kannada polymath Shivarama Karanth gave back an even higher",
  "honour, the Padma Bhushan. Back in the 1920s he had entered the freedom",
  "movement under the inspiration of Gandhi; now, after fifty years of striving",
  "to uphold its values, Karanth felt \u2018impelled to protest against such indignities",
  "done to the people of India\u2019.39",
  "Finally, there was resistance that was carried on underground. The key",
  "figureherewasGeorgeFernandes,thefirebrandsocialistwhohadledtherail-",
  "way strike of 1974. When the emergency was declared Fernandes was in the",
  "Orissa town of Gopalpur-on-Sea. He lay low for a few weeks, in which time",
  "he had grown a beard and come to disguise himself as a Sikh. Then he trav-",

  "the \u2018Nehru dynasty\u2019, and urging the people to rise against the regime.",
  "No dynamite was actually detonated, yet the government of India was",
  "visibly angry that it could not capture Fernandes. His brother Lawrence was",
  "picked up from his home in Bangalore and brutally beaten and tortured. His",

  "In the summer of 1976 one of the few opponents of the regime still at",
  "large was the nonagenarian J. B. Kripalani. He complained that he had been",
  "left out while all his friends were given the privilege of imprisonment. Then",
  "he recalled a Sindhi proverb: \u2018When a witch goes through a street destroying",
  "everything, she leaves one house untouched.\u201941 On 2 October 1975, Gandhi\u2019s",
  "birthday, he led a prayer meeting at the Mahatma\u2019s memorial in New Delhi \u2013",
  "speeches were made and several people arrested, but not him. It was not so",

  "several years before Jawaharlal Nehru did. He had been president of the Con-",
  "gress when freedom came three decades later. Later, three different states had",
  "sent him as their representative to the Indian Parliament. In sum, his CV was",
  "such that even the prime minister would have been embarrassed to arrest him",

  "VI",
  "The emergency revived the debate as to whether India could, should, or ever",
  "would be reliably democratic. In October 1975 a reporter from Time visited",
  "the country, and was much impressed by what he saw. He thought that pressfreedom and the like were \u2018of no great interest to the majority of India\u2019s 600",
  "million people\u2019, who were \u2018more concerned\u2019 with the rate of inflation (down",
  "31 per cent in the past year). \u2018The Prime Minister\u2019, he wrote, \u2018has won wide-",
  "spread support for seizing a rare opportunity to ram through a score of social",
  "reforms. These days India is engrossed in a frenzied campaign to encourage",
  "discipline, punctuality, cleanliness, courtesy.\u201943",
  "So at least someone was taking the slogans seriously. Where the Time",
  "reporter thought that democracy was unsuited to India, the Sydney Morning",
  "Herald despaired that it had died out in a country which had been \u2018the main",
  "hope of democracy in Asia, indeed in the developing world\u2019. If India had \u2018re-",
  "lapsed into traditional Asian autocracy\u2019, said the paper, the blame must be",
  "shared between \u2018Empress Indira\u2019 and her father, who had fostered \u2018heavy in-",
  "dustrialization and nationalized bureaucracies upon the Indian entrepreneur,",
  "Soviet style, in the name of \u201csocialism\u201d. To make his \u201csocialism\u201d work his",
  "daughter has merely added the complementary Soviet-style political dictator-",
  "ship.\u201944",
  "The \u2018India and/vs democracy\u2019 question was, as one might expect, most",
  "vigorously discussed in the British press. The political class in the United",
  "Kingdom was divided; while some MPs signed the \u2018Free JP appeal\u2019, Mrs",
  "Gandhi\u2019s regime was endorsed by, among others, Labour\u2019s Michael Foot (on",
  "thegroundsthatNehru\u2019sdaughtercoulddonowrong)andJennieLee,andthe",
  "Tory Margaret Thatcher. Both of the last named visited India and concluded",
  "that the emergency was, on balance, beneficial to its people. After travelling",
  "to India and speaking to Congress leaders, a Conservative MP named Eldon",
  "GriffithwrotetoTheTimesprotestingthattheregimewas\u2018farlessoppressive\u2019",

  "and a free press and autonomous institutions forged, before the emergency",

  "ond the political pale\u2019.45",
  "What was the prospect for the future? In an assessment on the emer-",

  "discount a return to democracy. For the most likely successor to Congress re-",
  "mains the Army\u2019.46",
  "VII",
  "The Observer made the mistake of focusing on institutions rather than indi-",
  "viduals. For, within India, what was being witnessed was not the army rising",

  "Recall that it was Sanjay Gandhi who had warned his mother against",
  "resigning, and he who had most strongly endorsed the emergency. In its first",
  "months he acquired a higher public profile. He was often to be seen by Mrs",
  "Gandhi\u2019sside,andwasevenadvisingheronCabinetappointments.Whenthe",
  "liberal I. K. Gujral was seen as being too soft on the press, he was replaced",
  "at the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting (I&B) by the more hard-line",
  "V. C. Shukla. When the experienced Swaran Singh (once a senior member of",
  "Nehru\u2019s Cabinet) was less than enthusiastic about the emergency, he was re-",
  "placed as defence minister by Sanjay\u2019s friend BansiLal.47",

  "Jana Sangh and the communists were based on cadres, Sanjay dismissed the",

  "\u2013 I don\u2019t think you will find a richer or more corrupt people anywhere\u2019.48",
  "Surge was a new magazine, and the interview was a scoop. The editor",
  "quickly sold the story to the agencies, who in turn passed it on to newspapers",
  "both Indian and foreign. These chose to highlight Sanjay Gandhi\u2019s views",
  "on free enterprise \u2013 so at odds with his mother\u2019s professed socialism \u2013 and",

  "policies, specially those affecting the poor people\u2019.49",
  "Sanjay was not deterred from giving more interviews, though. When the",
  "Illustrated Weekly of India asked him about curbs on the press, he answered",
  "that the papers \u2018constantly told blatant, malicious lies. Censorship was the",
  "only way to put an end to this.\u2019 Asked to provide a balance sheet of the emer-",
  "gency, he said that \u2018the greatest gain is a sense of discipline and the speeding",
  "up of work\u2019. And \u2018what has the country lost? Smuggling, black-marketing,",
  "hoarding, bus burning and the habit of coming late to work.\u201950",
  "The editor of the Weekly, Khushwant Singh, emerged as the chief cheer-",
  "leader and trumpeter of the rising son. Sanjay was termed as \u2018The Man Who",
  "Gets Things Done\u2019 and chosen as the \u2018Indian of the Year\u2019. The magazine ran",
  "lavish features on Sanjay and his young wife, Maneka, pages and pages of",
  "photographs accompanied by an invariably fawning text. (Samples: \u2018He has",

  "Less surprising perhaps was the attention paid to the prime minister\u2019s",
  "son by All-India Radio and the state-run television channel, Doordarshan. In",

  "was the deference paid him by Union ministers and chief ministers. Before",
  "deciding on which admiral to promote, the defence minister, Bansi Lal, took",
  "the two candidates to be questioned by Sanjay. When the young man visited",
  "Rajasthan, the state\u2019s chief minister came to the airport to receive him; on his",
  "drive into Jaipur city, Sanjay passed 501 arches erected in his honour. A sim-",

  "The prime minister had once chastised the Indian princes for promoting birth",
  "over talent. Now she had succumbed to that temptation herself. The elevation",
  "of hers on followed a notably feudal route. Just as an heir apparent is given a",

  "By now, Sanjay Gandhi had formulated a five-point programme to com-",
  "plement his mother\u2019s twenty-point one. These dealt with, respectively, family",
  "planning, afforestation, abolition of dowry, the removal of illiteracy and slum",
  "clearance. Of these the focus was on the first, nationally, and on the fifth,",
  "when it came to Delhi. The capital was dotted with slums that had spontan-",
  "eouslyarisentohousethemigrantswhodidthelow-payingjobsinresidential",
  "colonies and government offices. Here lived sweepers, rickshaw-pullers, do-",
  "mestic servants, office boys and their families. There were almost a hundred",
  "such settlements in the city, housing close to half a million people.55",
  "Sanjay Gandhi wanted these slums demolished and their inhabitants",
  "settled in farmland across the river Jumna. Here, his ideas coincided with",
  "those of Jagmohan, the ambitious vice-chairman of the Delhi Development",
  "Authority (DDA). Jagmohan\u2019s great hero was Baron Haussmann; he hoped",
  "to do for Delhi what that town planner had once done for Paris. By clearingtheslumsandbuildingboulevards,thebaronhadtransformedtheFrenchcap-",
  "ital. Once \u2018an ugly and despicable town\u2019, it had become a \u2018seat of vigorous",
  "andvibrant culture\u2019. However,Jagmohan\u2019sadmiration forautocratic methods",
  "was catholic. He praised what the Chinese communists had accomplished in",
  "Shanghai,forexample:thisa\u2018resultoffirmnationalpolicyandcommitment\u2019,",
  "when \u2018in India, on the other hand, we are still in a state of drift\u2019. The DDA",
  "vice-chairman once lamented that he was",
  "No Haussmann reborn",
  "No Lutyens with a chance",
  "Nor Corbusier with Nehru\u2019s arms",
  "I am a little fellow",
  "An orphan of these streets",
  "Still,",
  "With all the millstones",
  "Around my neck",
  "I stand erect",
  "Restless and keen",
  "Willing to fight",
  "Willing to dream. ..56",
  "This was written in 1974, before the emergency. A year later Sanjay Gandhi",
  "arrived, to free Jagmohan\u2019s arms, to remove the millstones from round his",
  "neck.Thetownplannerhadlongbeendisturbedbyslums,signsofa\u2018sickand",

  "people.",

  "Businessmen seeking licences or tax exemptions rushed to them; so did MPs",
  "hoping for a Cabinet appointment. Contrasts were drawn between Sanjay\u2019s",

  "Western journalists feared large-scale famine; Western biologists had written",

  "the high increase in human numbers, the per capita income grew at a mere 1",

  "The debates on India\u2019s population size dated from the earliest days of",
  "Independence. Social workers had set up a Family Planning Association of In-",
  "dia in 1949. The Planning Commission had spoken of the importance of fam-",
  "ily planning since its inception in 1950\u20131. However, culture and economics",
  "worked in favour of large families. The biases in educational development",
  "meant that girls were still valued more as child-bearers than as wage-earners.",
  "The continuing dependence on agriculture placed a premium on children. Indi-",
  "an Muslims and Catholics were enjoined by their clergy to abjure family plan-",
  "ning. And Hindu couples greatly preferred sons to daughters, trying and trying",
  "again until they had one.",
  "In 1901 the population of India stood at about 240 million; by 1971 it had",
  "reached close to550million. Inthis period, birth rates hadfallen slightly,from",
  "nearly 50 births per 1,000 Indians to about 40. However, the decline in death",
  "rates had been far steeper, from 42 per 1,000 at the turn of the century down to",

  "Yet a year later, the Illustrated Weekly of India was speaking of how \u2018San-",

  "country\u2019. He claimed that if his programme was implemented, \u201850 per cent of",

  "solving of which, everyone acknowledged, was vital if the nation hoped to",
  "survive, let alone prosper\u2019. And so, \u2018family planning became the lynchpin of",

  "encourage him to exceed it. These targets were passed down to district offi-",
  "cials, who were rewarded if they met or exceeded them and transferred oth-",

  "were built for the landless under the twenty-point programme. A few slogans",
  "were painted denouncing the dictatorship. Then, in September 1976 \u2013 shortly",
  "after Sanjay Gandhi\u2019s visit to the state \u2013 a campaign for compulsory steriliza-",
  "tion began in the villages. Local officials prepared lists of \u2018eligible men\u2019, that",
  "is, of those who already had three or more children. Police vans would come",
  "and take them off to the nearest health centre. Some men fled into the hills to",
  "escape the marauders. Those who had undergone a vasectomy were too em-",
  "barrassed to talk about it.66",
  "As with slum demolition, here too there was resistance. In September",
  "1976 an underground newspaper reported a \u2018wave of protests\u2019 against family",
  "planning in Delhi and Uttar Pradesh. There were clashes between health offi-",
  "cials and shopkeepers refusing to be sterilized. Resistance was reported from",

  "the foreign press, and the prime minister was constrained to admit in Parlia-",

  "An incidental victim of Sanjay Gandhi\u2019s family planning drive was the",

  "Various theories were offered \u2013 that it was the manifestation of the guilt of a",
  "working mother and single parent, that she was paranoid about assassination",
  "and hence could trust only her family, that Sanjay knew her darkest secrets",
  "and hence had a hold over her, that she was grateful for his support when the",
  "emergency was declared. However appealing to the biographer, to the histor-",
  "ian such speculation is nearly useless. For what matters here is not intent but",
  "consequence\u2013notwhyMrsGandhichosetorelysomuchonheryoungerson",
  "but on what this reliance meant for India and Indians.",
  "ItistemptingtoviewMrsGandhi\u2019spolitical careerasbeingdividedinto",
  "two phases, with the emergency and Sanjay Gandhi providing the dividing",
  "line. Before Sanjay, it might be said, she won elections, created Bangladesh,",
  "reformed the Congress Party and made bold attempts to reorganize the eco-",
  "nomy. Under Sanjay\u2019s malign influence she turned her back on these larger",
  "socialgoalsandbecameobsessedwiththepreservationofherselfandherfam-",
  "ily.69However, when one views the prime minister\u2019s career in the round, San-",
  "jay and the emergency should be said to mark not a radical departure from",
  "past practice, but a deepening of it. From the time of the Congress split, Mrs",
  "Gandhi had worked to place loyal individuals in position of authority, and",
  "to make public institutions an instrument of her will. Institutions such as the",
  "bureaucracy, the judiciary, the presidency and the Congress Party had been",
  "eroded well before the emergency. Sanjay\u2019s arrival took the process further \u2013",
  "somewouldarguemuchfurther.Italsovulgarized andcorruptedit,andmade",
  "it more violent. But the process itself antedated his entry into Indian politics.",
  "By June 1975 Mrs Gandhi had been prime minister of India for a little",
  "less than a decade. When one compares her tenure with that of her father, one",
  "is struck by a striking paradox \u2013 that Nehru\u2019s halting yet honest attempts to",
  "promote a democratic ethos in a hierarchical society were undone by his own",
  "daughter, and in decisive and dramatic ways. The grievously mistaken dis-",
  "missal of the communist government in Kerala aside, Nehru took seriously",

  "spect.SheattendedParliamentlessregularlythanNehru,andspokemuchless",
  "wheninit.Nehruforgedabidingfriendshipswithpoliticiansofotherparties\u2013",
  "something quite inconceivable in the case of Mrs Gandhi. Then there was the",
  "contrast with how they treated their own party. In Nehru\u2019s time the Congress",
  "wasadecentralizedandlargelydemocraticorganization.Evenhadhebeenso",
  "inclined, he would not have been able to impose a chief minister against the",
  "will of a state\u2019s own politicians.",
  "Thecontrastisreinforcedwhenoneconsiderstheother,non-politicalas-",
  "pects of democratic life in India. Nehru respected the freedom of the press,",
  "and allowed it to flourish. Nehru respected the autonomy of the bureaucracy",
  "andthejudiciary:therearenoknowncasesofhishavingintervenedtofavour",
  "or act against a particular official.",
  "Atleast fromthetime oftheCongress split in1969,MrsGandhihadbe-",
  "guntodepartfromthepoliticaltraditionsofIndia\u2019sfoundingpremier.Thede-",
  "partures became more marked over the years, and became fully apparent only",
  "with the enactment of the emergency and the repression that followed. For",
  "partisan reasons of their own, opposition politicians could not posit a contrast",
  "between the first and third prime ministers of India. Because they had once",
  "opposed Nehru, and because the Congress was now led by his daughter, they",
  "could scarcely praise one and diminish the other.",
  "Unbound by such constraints, Western writers who knew both leaders",
  "could see quite clearly how Indira Gandhi had departed from Jawaharlal",
  "Nehru.Ayearintotheemergency,twoBritishfriendsofNehrumadethecon-trast the focus of their criticisms of the regime. Writing in the Times, Fenner",
  "Brockway deplored the conversion of \u2018the world\u2019s greatest democracy\u2019 into",
  "a \u2018repressive dictatorship\u2019. Himself \u2018a son of India\u2019, Brockway \u2018appeal[ed] to",
  "Mrs Gandhi in memory of the principles of her distinguished father, to end",
  "these denials of freedom and liberty\u2019.70 Writing in the Spectator, John Grigg",
  "recalled Nehru\u2019s commitment to free elections and a free press. India\u2019s first",
  "prime minister was \u2018a true patriot because he was a true democrat . . . During",
  "his long premiership he made many mistakes but on the vital libertarian is-",
  "sue he never broke faith with the Indian people.\u2019 But now, noted Grigg sadly,",
  "\u2018Nehru\u2019s tryst with destiny seems to have been turned into atryst with despot-",
  "ism \u2013 and by his own daughter.\u2019 Mrs Gandhi \u2018should have been the proudest",
  "upholder of India\u2019s democratic experiment, which was proving to the whole",
  "world that people did not have to be rich or educated to enjoy civil liberties\u2019.",
  "Yet by her actions she had \u2018spuriously confirmed\u2019 the view of \u2018old-fashioned",
  "imperialists\u2019 that \u2018only authoritarian methods can work in a country like In-",
  "dia\u2019. Grigg asked the prime minister to free herself from her son\u2019s influence",

  "at whatever cost in power, \u201cface\u201d, and mother-love \u2013 to restore the freedoms",
  "she has taken away\u2019. To do so, he wrote, \u2018would be the hardest act of her ca-",
  "reer but it would also be the bravest and best\u2019.71",
  "OtherBritishfriendswroteprivatelytoMrsGandhi,urginghertoendthe",
  "emergency. One such was the old Quaker Horace Alexander, who had once",
  "mediated between Mahatma Gandhi and the British Raj, and also first intro-",
  "duced the current prime minister to the delights of bird watching in the Indi-",
  "an countryside.72 There was also impersonal yet very public criticism, offered",
  "in the then widely respected Times newspaper by the even more widely re-",
  "spected columnist Bernard Levin. In October 1976 Levin wrote two long art-",
  "icles on the recent attacks on democracy in India. Speaking of the suspen-",
  "sion of habeas corpus, and the curbs on the press, he warned that Mrs Gandhi",
  "wasturninghercountryintoa\u2018tin-potdictatorship\u2019. InthefirstweekofJanu-",
  "ary1977hewrotetwomoreessays,criticizingtheconstitutionalamendments",

  "visions\u2019 were \u2018entirely unnecessary except to one who wants total power and",
  "the ability to use it without check\u2019. These latest changes, said Levin, had con-",
  "firmed the \u2018transformation of India into a fully authoritarian regime under its",
  "seedy dictator, Mrs Indira Gandhi\u2019.73",
  "On18January1977theprimeministerannouncedthatParliamentwasto",
  "be dissolved and fresh elections held. This came as a surprise to her political",
  "opponents, who were let out of their cells even as the announcement was be-ing made on All-India Radio. And, from all accounts, it came as a shock to",
  "hers on Sanjay, who too had not been informed before hand. The term of",
  "the present Parliament could have been extended, year after year. The under-",
  "ground resistance had been fully tamed. And yet Mrs Gandhi decided, sud-",
  "denly and without consulting anyone, to return India to democracy.",
  "Therewasmuchspeculation astowhytheprimeministerhadturnedher",
  "back on emergency rule. In the Delhi coffee houses, the gossip was that her",
  "intelligence chief had assured her that the Congress would be re-elected with",
  "a comfortable majority. Some felt that it was the consequence of competitive",
  "one-upmanship. President Bhutto had just announced elections in his usually",
  "autocraticPakistan;couldMrsGandhidelayelectionsinherunnaturallyauto-",
  "cratic India? Her secretary, writing long after the event, offered yet a third",
  "explanation. The emergency, he noted, had cut Mrs Gandhi off from the pub-",
  "lic contact that previously nourished her. \u2018She was nostalgic about the way",
  "people reacted to her in the 1971 campaign and she longed to hear again the",
  "applause of the multitudes.\u201974",
  "Perhaps all these factors contributed. So did the criticism from Western",
  "observersand(especially)friends.Asidefromthosealreadyquoted,theemer-",

  "come a police state in which democracy has been smothered\u2019.75",
  "What, finally, persuaded Mrs Gandhi to end the emergency? One cannot",
  "say for certain, but it does seem that she was stung by the comments of those",
  "foreignobserversimpossibletodismissasenemiesofIndia.FennerBrockway",
  "and John Grigg were not Richard Nixon and the CIA. Nor were they scep-",

  "this way: \u2018Indira is in the Prime Minister\u2019s house, and Jawaharlal is back to",

  "The allusion was to a series of letters written to Indira Gandhi by Nehru",
  "intheearly 1930s,while lodgedinaBritish jail. These presented histhirteen-",
