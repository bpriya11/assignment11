  "generation of a nation is not possible\u2019, insisted M. S. Golwalkar. It was, there-",
  "fore,",
  "necessary to revive the fundamental values and ideas, and to wipe out all",
  "signs that reminded us of our past slavery and humiliation. It is our first",
  "necessity to see ourselves in pristine purity. Our present and future has to",
  "be well united with our glorious past. The broken chain has got to be re-",

  "with any onslaught on this particular point of our national honour, and to",

  "should find topmost priority in our programme of national renaissance in",

  "cow. Yet his call to make cow-slaughter a national priority stemmed from a",
  "much greater goal, that of uniting the Hindus.",
  "The cow was found all over India. Hindus too were found all over India.",
  "And Hindus worshipped the cow, whereas Muslims and Christians preferred",
  "to butcher and eat it. That was the logic on which the RSS sought to build a",
  "nationwide campaign. Fourteen years after Golwalkar\u2019s article, a large crowd",
  "marched on Parliament to demand a countrywide ban on cow-slaughter. That",
  "was the campaign\u2019s high point, and its appeal steadily declined thereafter.",
  "Evenatitszenithitsmainattractions weretoHinduholymenandRSSwork-",

  "In 1984 the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), successor to the old Jana Sangh,",
  "won a mere two seats in the eighth general election. Five years later its tally",
  "was eighty-six. A major reason for this rise was its involvement in the Ayod-",
  "hya campaign.",
  "Anxious to keep the Congress out of power, the BJP now supported V.",
  "P. Singh\u2019s National Front without joining the government. However, the de-",
  "cision to implement the Mandal Commission\u2019s report, announced in August",
  "1990, threw the party into a tizzy. Some leaders thought this a diabolical planto break up Hindu society. Others argued that the extension of affirmative ac-",

  "fitted up to look like a rath (chariot), stopping to hold public meetings on the",

  "Commencing on 25 September 1990, Mr Advani\u2019s rath yatra planned to",
  "reachAyodhyafiveweekslater,aftertravellingmorethan6,000milesthrough",
  "eight states. Militants of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) flanked the van,",
  "flagging it off from one town and welcoming it at the next. At public meet-",
  "ings they were complemented by saffron-robed sadhus, whose \u2018necklaces of",
  "prayer beads, long beards and ash-marked foreheads provided a strong visu-",
  "al counterpoint\u2019 to these armed young men. The march\u2019s imagery was reli-",
  "gious,allusive,militant,masculine,andanti-Muslim\u2019.Thiswasreinforcedby",
  "the speeches made by Advani, which accused the government of \u2018appeasing\u2019",
  "theMuslimminorityandofpractisinga\u2018pseudo-secularism\u2019whichdeniedthe",
  "legitimate interests and aspirations of the Hindu majority. The building of a",
  "Ram temple inAyodhyawaspresented asthe symbolic fulfilment ofthese in-",
  "terests and aspirations.2",
  "Advani\u2019s march through north-western India was a major headache to",
  "V. P. Singh\u2019s government. For the procession \u2018posed a provocation that could",
  "not be ignored. Growing disorder, riots, and a final destruction of the mosque",
  "loomed ahead. Yet there would be serious consequences to stopping it. Not",
  "only would Singh have to act against [the revered god] Rama, but he would",
  "alsobringdownhisownrulingcoalitionandriskseriousdisorder.\u20193Theyatra",
  "reached Delhi, where Advani camped for several days, daring the govern-",
  "ment to arrest him. The challenge was ducked, and the procession started up",
  "again.However,aweekbeforeitwastoreachitsfinaldestination,thevanwas",
  "stopped and Advani placed under preventive detention. The arrest had been",
  "ordered by the Bihar chief minister Lalu Prasad Yadav, through whose state",
  "the march was then passing.",
  "While L. K. Advani cooled his heels in a Bihar government guest house,",
  "his followers were making their way to Ayodhya. Thousands of kar sevaks(volunteers) were converging from all parts of the country. The Uttar Pradesh",
  "chief minister, Mulayam Singh Yadav, was, like his Bihari namesake, a bitter",
  "political opponent of the BJP. He ordered the mass arrest of the visitors from",
  "out of state. Apparently as many as 150,000 kar sevaks were detained, but al-",
  "mosthalfasmanystillfoundtheirwaytoAyodhya.Twentythousandsecurity",
  "personnel were already in the temple town, some regular police, others from",
  "the paramilitary Border Security Force (BSF).",
  "On the morning of 30 October a large crowd of kar sevaks was intercep-",
  "ted at abridge on the river Sarayu, which divided Ayodhya\u2019s old town from",
  "the new. The volunteers pushed their way past the police and surged towards",
  "the Babri Masjid. There they were met by BSF contingents. Some kar sevaks",

  "\u2018martyrs\u2019. The state of Uttar Pradesh was rocked by a series of religious riots.",
  "Hindu mobs attacked Muslim localities, and \u2013 in a manner reminiscent of the",
  "grisly Partition massacres \u2013 stopped trains to pull out and kill those who were",
  "recognizably Muslim. In some places the victims retaliated, whereupon they",
  "were set upon by the Provincial Armed Constabulary, long notorious for its",
  "hostility towards the minority community.5",
  "As one commentator put it, L. K. Advani\u2019s rath yatra had, in effect, be-",
  "come a raktyatra, a journey of blood.6",
  "III",
  "Among the casualties of the rath yatra was Prime Minister V. P. Singh. In",
  "November 1990 he resigned, unable to sustain his minority government in",
  "the absence of BJP support. As in 1979 \u2013 when Morarji Desai demitted of-",
  "fice \u2013 the Congress allowed a lame-duck prime minister (in this case ChandraShekhar) to hold charge while they prepared for midterm elections to be held",
  "in the summer of 1991. In the middle of the campaign Rajiv Gandhi was as-",
  "sassinated while speaking in a town in Tamil Nadu. The assassin, who was",
  "also blown up by the bomb she was carrying, was later revealed to be a rep-",
  "resentative of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam. The killing was an act",
  "of vengeance, for the LTTE had not forgiven Rajiv Gandhi for sending troops",
  "against them in 1987.",
  "Notwithstanding the murder of Rajiv Gandhi, the elections went ahead",
  "on schedule. Pollsters had predicted a hung Parliament, with no party any-",
  "where near a majority. However, the sympathy generated by the killing al-",
  "lowed the Congress to win 244 seats. With support from independents they",
  "were in a position to form a government. P. V. Narasimha Rao, a veteran of",
  "theCongressPartyfromAndhraPradeshwhohadheldimportant positions in",
  "Rajiv Gandhi\u2019s Cabinet, was sworn in as prime minister.",
  "In these Parliamentary elections of 1991 the BJP won 120 seats, up",
  "thirty-five from the last time. It also won the assembly elections in Uttar",
  "Pradesh. It was now in power in four states in northern India (Madhya",
  "Pradesh, Rajasthan andHimachal Pradesh being the others). Clearly,the Ram",
  "campaign was paying political dividends. Riots were being effectively trans-",
  "lated into votes. At the same time, these successes at the polls had led to a",
  "crisis of identity. Was the BJP a political party, or was it a social movement?",
  "Some leaders thought the party should now put the mosque-versus-temple",
  "controversy on the back burner. It should instead raise broader questions of",
  "economic and foreign policy and work to expand its influence in south India.",
  "Ontheotherside,theVHPandtheRSSweredeterminedtokeepthespotlight",
  "on that disputed territory in Ayodhya. In October 1991 they acquired the land",
  "around the mosque and began levelling the ground, preparing for temple con-",
  "struction.",
  "In July 1992 a team from the central government was sent to study the",
  "situation. They found that there had been \u2018large-scale demolition\u2019 on the dis-",
  "puted site, and the building of a \u2018large concrete platform\u2019, both developments",
  "in clear contravention of court orders demanding that the status quo be main-",
  "tained.Totheirdismay,theUttarPradeshgovernment,headedbytheoldRSS",

  "in sum, \u2018flagrant violation of the law in Ayodhya\u2019.",
  "Worriedthatthetroublewouldescalate,theHomeMinistryinNewDelhi",
  "had prepared a contingency plan, allowing for the imposition of President\u2019s",
  "Rule in Uttar Pradesh and a central takeover of the mosque/ temple complex.",
  "However,Prime Minister Rao still hopedforthe matter toberesolved bydia-logue. He had several meetings with VHP leaders and also consulted with the",
  "opposing Babri Masjid Action Committee. The possibility of having the mat-",
  "ter referred to the Supreme Court was also discussed.7",
  "Meanwhile,theVHPannouncedthat6Decemberhadbeenchosenasthe",
  "\u2018auspicious\u2019 day on which work on the temple would commence. From the",
  "middle of November volunteers began streaming into Ayodhya, encouraged",
  "by the fact that the state government was now in the hands of the BJP. The",
  "chief minister, Kalyan Singh, was summoned to New Delhi. Narasimha Rao",
  "urged him to allow the Supreme Court to decide on the case. Singh told the",
  "PMthat\u2018theonlycomprehensivesolutiontotheAyodhyadisputewastohand",
  "over the disputed structure to the Hindus\u2019.8",
  "Kalyan Singh had instructed his government to house and feed the thou-",
  "sandsofvolunteerscominginfromoutofthestate.Reportsofthislarge-scale",
  "influx alarmed the Home Ministry. They prepared a fresh contingency plan,",
  "under which paramilitary forces would be sent to Ayodhya. By the end of the",
  "month some 20,000 troops had been stationed at locations within an hour\u2019s",
  "march of the town, ready to move in when required. This, claimed the home",
  "secretary at the time, \u2018was the largest mobilisation of such forces for such an",
  "operation since Independence\u2019.9",
  "On the other side, more than 100,000 kar sevaks had reached the temple",
  "town,\u2018completewithtrishuls[tridents]andbowsandarrows\u2019.Onthelastday",
  "of November, at a press conference in Delhi at which he announced his own",
  "departure for Ayodhya, L. K. Advani said that \u2018I cannot give any guarantee at",
  "the moment on what will happen on 6 December. All I know is that we are",
  "going to perform kar seva.\u201910",
  "On the morning of the 6th, a journalist at the site found that \u2018straddling",

  "11.30, on the raised platform constructed beforehand. However, by this time",

  "hundreds of kar sevaks to charge the mosque, waving axes and iron bars.By noon, volunteers were crawling all over the Masjid, holding saffron",
  "flags and shouting slogans of victory. Grappling hooks were anchored to the",

  "Was the demolition of the Babri Masjid planned beforehand? Or was it",
  "simply the result of a spontaneous display of popular emotion and anger? To",
  "be sure, some BJP leaders were taken aback by the turn of events. Despite his",
  "threatening talk the week before, when he saw volunteers rushing the monu-",
  "ment, L. K. Advani asked them to return. As the domes came crashing down,",
  "he got into an argument with the senior RSS functionaries H. V. Seshadri and",
  "K. S. Sudarshan. They thought that now the deed was done, the RSS and the",
  "BJP should claim credit for it. \u2018The course of history is not pre-determined\u2019,",
  "saidSudarshantoAdvani.\u2018Acceptwhathashappened.\u2019Advaniansweredthat",
  "he would instead \u2018publicly express regret for it\u2019.12",
  "In press conferences after the event, the term most often used by BJP",
  "spokesmen to describe the happenings at Ayodhya was \u2018unfortunate\u2019. They",
  "knew that in a democracy ostensibly bound by the rule of law, an act of van-",
  "dalism by the main opposition party could scarcely be condoned. When he",
  "met the press at the party\u2019s Delhi headquarters on the evening of the 6th, the",
  "ideologue K. R. Malkani \u2018made it clear that we did want the old structure to",
  "go, but that we wanted it gone through due process of law. The regret was",
  "that it had been demolished in an irregular manner.\u2019 Seeking to distance the",
  "BJP from the act, he claimed that the kar sevaks who attacked the mosque",
  "were most likely from the Shiv Sena, since they had been heard speaking in",
  "Marathi.13",
  "The radicals within the movement were less coy. One VHP leader boas-",
  "ted that, in September itself, engineers had been asked to identify the struc-",
  "ture\u2019s weak spots and volunteers trained on how best to bring it down.",

  "that \u2018the Ayodhya movement has to be seen as the starting point of a cultural",
  "awareness and understanding that would ultimately result in a complete re-",
  "structuring of the Indian public life in ways that would be in consonance with",

  "reshaping of India as a Hindu nation.15",
  "One cannot be certain that all Hindus shared these sentiments \u2013 as",
  "Shourie presumed they did. But those Hindus who brought down the mosque",
  "on 6 December had certainly bent the Indian state to their will. The forces to",
  "stop them were at hand, yet the order telling them to act never came. Worried",
  "thatitwouldbechargedwithbeinganti-Hindu,thegovernmentofPrimeMin-",
  "ister Narasimha Rao \u2018came to perceive the lesser evil in the demolition of the",
  "mosque\u2019. Only after the deed was done was action taken \u2013 in the shape of the",
  "dismissal of the Uttar Pradesh government and the imposition of President\u2019s",
  "Rule.16",
  "IV",
  "When the domes of the Babri Masjid fell, they brought those atop them down",
  "too. More than fifty kar sevaks were injured, some very seriously. At least six",
  "deaths were reported. The aftermath of the event was, however, more deadly",
  "still. The main leaders of the BJP, such as L. K. Advani, were taken into pro-",
  "tective custody, yet riots broke out in town after town, in an orgy of violence",
  "that lasted two months and claimed more than 2,000 lives.",
  "The troubles began in the vicinity itself. An influential local priest had",
  "expressedthedesirethatAyodhyashouldbecomethe\u2018VaticanoftheHindus\u2019.",
  "To cleanse the town of the minorities was one step towards that larger goal.",
  "Kar sevaks celebrated the felling of the mosque by setting fire to Muslim",
  "homes and localities. In other towns, riots were a consequence of processions",
  "organized by the Vishwa Hindu Parishad. Elsewhere it was Muslims who",
  "came out into the streets to protest the demolition, by attacking police posts",
  "and attempting to burn government buildings.",
  "Sometimes sparked by triumphant Hindus, at other times by defiant",

  "Meanwhile, to the north of the city, the shanty town of Dharavi was suf-",
  "fering from an excess of Hindu triumphalism. A \u2018victory rally\u2019 organized by",
  "the BJP and Shiv Sena ended in attacks on Muslim homes and shops. In re-",

  "On 9 December the Shiv Sena and the BJP announced a city wide strike",
  "to protest against the arrest of their leaders in Ayodhya. This, recalled a Bom-",
  "bay journalist, \u2018was a signal for their followers to go on the rampage. They",
  "attacked mosques and Muslim establishments. In one locality, the Shiv Sena",
  "put up a notice announcing an award of Rs50,000 to anyone pointing out a",
  "Muslim house.\u201919",

  "The cause was not clear \u2013 it might have been a product of union rivalry \u2013 but",
  "the story that Hindus were killed in a Muslim area spread through the city,",

  "complete\u2019.23 Two years later the Bharatiya Janata Party reaped the rewards in",
  "the eleventh general election. It won 161 seats, emerging as the largest single",
  "party in Parliament. The Congress was relegated to second place, twenty-one",
  "seats behind. The veteran BJP leader Atal Behari Vajpayee was invited to",
  "formthegovernment,butaftertwoweeksheresigned,failingtocobbleama-",

  "was governed by a motley coalition of regional parties calling itself the Na-",

  "sition further, winning 182 seats. This time, the support of smaller parties and",
  "independents gave it the numbers to govern. However, within a year it called",
  "a fresh election, hoping to do better still. As it happened, it won the same",
  "number of seats (182), but the Congress hit an all-time low of 114. A strong",
  "performance by its allies allowed the BJP to govern for a further five years.",
  "Thus, the BJP\u2019s Atal Behari Vajpayee became the country\u2019s longest-serving",
  "non-Congress prime minister, occupying that office for six years altogether.",
  "In the first years of Independence the wounds of Partition had provided",
  "the excuse for a vigorous assertion by the Hindu right. The RSS was partic-",
  "ularly active. But when the Jana Sangh won a mere three seats in the 1952",
  "elections, commentators were ready to write an epitaph for a party that, in a",
  "modern, secular, democratic state, dared to base its politics on religion. The",
  "socialist politician Asoka Mehta wrote that Hindu communalism \u2018has proved",
  "to be weak twice, once in [the elections of ] 1946 and again in 1951\u20132\u2019. He",
  "was confident that \u2018its ghost is now laid for good\u2019.24 \u2018The Hindu is too toler-",
  "ant\u2019, remarked the writer-couple Taya and Maurice Zinkin, themselves long",
  "resident in India. The election results had shown that \u2018Hindu communalism",
  "has been utterly defeated\u2019, indeed, that \u2018communalism has thus failed, prob-",
  "ably finally\u2019.25",
  "Other observers, the Kashmiri leader Sheikh Abdullah among them,",
  "thoughtthat itwasmostly Jawaharlal NehruwhokepttheIndianstate andIn-",
  "dianpoliticsonthesecularpath.Theyworriedaboutwhatwouldhappenafter",
  "he was gone. After Nehru\u2019s death the Jana Sangh slowly gained in influence.",
  "It won twenty-five seats to the Lok Sabha in 1967 and twenty-two in 1971,",
  "more or less holding its own despite the \u2018Indira wave\u2019 of that year. Later, its",
  "participation in the JP movement, its leaders\u2019 incarceration during the emer-gencyanditsroleintheJanatagovernmentsubstantiallyincreasedtheparty\u2019s",
  "profile and presence. Then it fell away again. As the freshly named Bharatiya",
  "Janata Party it won two seats in the elections of 1984. Even Atal Behari Va-",

  "the two communities had lived next to one another, traded with one another,",

  "and conflict. Each community thought itself theologically superior, each had",
  "memories \u2013 real or imagined \u2013 of being scorned or victimized by the other.",
  "However, the compulsions of living together meant that these divisions were",
  "deflected or subsumed by activities conducted in common. But with the riots",
  "sparked by the Ayodhya movement, the ambivalences had been replaced by",
  "anunambiguousanimosity.Hostilityandsuspicionwerenowthegoverning\u2013",
  "some would say only \u2013 idioms of Hindu-Muslim relations.27",
  "Fewerinnumbers,andgenerallypoorerineconomicterms,theMuslims",
  "had more to lose from the souring of relations. In most riots more Muslims",
  "died than Hindus, more Muslim homes were burnt than Hindu ones. The",
  "whole community had become prey to a deep insecurity. The taunts of Hindu",
  "chauvinists that they should move to Pakistan made them feel vulnerable and",
  "victimized. The sentiments of the ordinary Indian Muslim, circa 1995, were",
  "movingly expressed by the Telugu poet Khadar Mohiuddin. On the one hand,",
  "he wrote, the Muslim is told by the Hindus to think that",
  "My religion is a conspiracy",
  "My prayer meetings are a conspiracyMy lying quiet is a conspiracy",
  "My attempt to wake up is a conspiracy",
  "My desire to have friends is a conspiracy",
  "My ignorance, my backwardness, a conspiracy.",
  "On the other hand, said Khadar,",
  "It\u2019s no conspiracy",
  "[for the Hindu] to make me a refugee",
  "in the very country of my birth",
  "It\u2019s no conspiracy",
  "to poison the air I breathe",
  "and the space I live in",
  "It\u2019s certainly no conspiracy",
  "to cut me to pieces",
  "and then imagine an uncut Bharat.",
  "The Muslim was being continually asked to prove his loyalty to India. As",
  "Khadar Mohiuddin found, \u2018cricket matches weigh and measure my patriot-",
  "ism\u2019 When India played Pakistan, it was demanded of Muslims that they dis-",
  "play the national flag outside their homes, and that they loudly and publicly",
  "cheer for the national side. In the poet\u2019s words: \u2018Never mind my love for my",
  "motherland/ What\u2019s important is how much I hate the other land\u2019.28",
  "The polarization of the two communities was a victory for the Sangh",
  "Parivar,thecollectivenamebywhichthefamilyoforganizationsbuiltaround",
  "the RSS and the BJP is known. Through the first five decades of Indian inde-",

  "Goyal\u2019sauthoritativehistoryoftheRSS.InGoyal\u2019srendition,thecorebeliefs",
  "of what the Sangh Parivar calls \u2018Hindutva\u2019 are as follows:",
  "Hindus have lived in India since times immemorial; Hindus are the na-",
  "tionbecauseallculture,civilisationandlifeiscontributedbythemalone;",
  "non-Hindus are invaders or guests and cannot be treated as equal un-",
  "less they adopt Hindu traditions, culture etc.; the non-Hindus, particu-",
  "larly Muslims and Christians, have been enemies of everything Hinduand are, therefore, to be treated as threats; the freedom and progress of",
  "this country is the freedom and progress of Hindus; the history of India",
  "is the history of the struggle of the Hindus for protection and preserva-",
  "tion of their religion and culture against the onslaught of these aliens;",
  "the threat continues because the power is in the hands of those who do",
  "not believe in this nation as a Hindu Nation; those who talk of nation-",
  "al unity as the unity of all those who live in this country are motivated",
  "by the selfish desire of cornering minority votes and are therefore trait-",
  "ors;theunityandconsolidationoftheHindusisthedireneedofthehour",
  "because the Hindu people are surrounded on all sides by enemies; the",
  "Hindus must develop the capacity for massive retaliation and offence is",
  "the best defence; lack of unity is the root cause of all the troubles of the",
  "Hindus and the Sangh is born with the divine mission to bring about that",
  "unity.29",
  "Goyal adds that \u2018without fear of contradiction it can be stated that nothing",
  "morethanthishasbeensaidintheRSSshakhasduringthepast74yearsofits",
  "existence\u2019.",
  "While its ideology was unchanged, in time the organization of the RSS",
  "grew enormously in strength and influence. Once an all-male body, it opened",
  "a separate women\u2019s wing which both schoolgirls and housewives were en-",
  "couraged to join. Once limited to northern India, it setup active branches in",
  "states where it previously had no presence at all. Everywhere the core ideo-",
  "logy of the Sangh was adapted to the local context. Thus, in Gujarat, the re-",
  "building of the ancient Somnath temple was celebrated as a manifestation of",
  "a united and assertive Hinduism. In Orissa the focus was on the great Jagan-",
  "natha temple, used by the RSS to build bridges between the local and pan-In-",
  "dianHinduidentities.Therewasaparticularemphasisonworkintribalareas,",
  "on \u2018reclaiming\u2019 the adivasis and \u2018returning\u2019 them to the Hindu fold. Schools",
  "were opened where tribal youths were taught Sanskrit and acquainted with",
  "Hindu myths and legends. The RSS worked hard in times of natural calam-",
  "ity, bringing grain when the rains failed and rebuilding homes after an earth-",
  "quake.30",
  "As its organization grew, the RSS\u2019s ideology found even fuller expres-",
  "sionthroughanewcampaignstrategy.M.S.Golwalkarhadthoughtthatcow-",
  "slaughter was the issue on which the Sangh Parivar would launch a country-",
  "wide struggle. That failed, but then the egregious mistakes of the Congress",
  "delivered an even more emotive issue into their lap. When Rajiv Gandhi\u2019sgovernmentappeasedMuslimfanaticsandoverturnedtheSupremeCourtver-",
  "dictintheShahBanocase,theHinduradicalscouldclaim,moreconvincingly",
  "than ever,that (pace D.R. Goyal\u2019swordsabove) the present rulers were \u2018mo-",
  "tivated by the selfish desire of cornering minority votes\u2019, that to counter this,",
  "\u2018the unity and consolidation of the Hindus is the dire need of the hour\u2019. That",
  "\u2018non-Hindus are invaders or guests\u2019 was further proven by the stubborn re-",
  "luctance of Muslims to hand over the Babri Masjid. The monument itself was",
  "a standing insult to Hindu pride, a nasty reminder of the slavery of past times",
  "that had not yet been fully overcome. That they were not allowed to construct",
  "a shrine to their beloved Lord Ram was only because \u2018the Hindu people are",
  "surroundedonallsidesbyenemies\u2019;enemieswithin,asinthepoliticianswho",
  "appeased Muslims, and enemies without, as in the malevolent Muslim na-",
  "tion (Pakistan) which had fought three wars against them. To build the Ram",
  "temple, but also to protect themselves more generally, the Hindus had to \u2018de-",
  "velop the capacity for massive retaliation\u2019 , to realize that \u2018offence is the best",
  "defence\u2019.",
  "TothephrasesalreadyquotedfromD.R.Goyal\u2019ssummation,letusnow",
  "add the critical last line: \u2018lack of unity is the root cause of all the troubles of",
  "the Hindus and the Sangh is born with the divine mission to bring about that",
  "unity\u2019.",
  "In the Ram movement, the RSS\u2019s mission was furthered by its sister or-",
  "ganizations, in particular the Vishwa Hindu Parishad, which had taken up the",
  "issue in the first place. Then there was the Bajrang Dal, named after Ram\u2019s",
  "great monkey devotee Hanuman (who was also called Bajrang Bali). This",
  "was composed of angry youths, equipped not so much to \u2018protect\u2019 their idol",
  "(as Hanuman is supposed to have done) but to beat up anyone who stood in",
  "their way. Finally, there was the Shiv Sena, actually another party altogeth-",
  "er, and whose ideas and methods were even more extreme than the VHP and",
  "the Bajrang Dal. They were prone to calling Muslims \u2018poisonous snakes\u2019 and",
  "\u2018traitors\u2019, and advising them to move to Pakistan.31",
  "By the 1980s the RSS could no longer be called a male or north-Indian",
  "body;ithadreachedouttowomenandtootherpartsofthecountry.However,",
  "it was only through the Ram movement that it successfully overthrew the tag",
  "of being a \u2018Brahmin-Bania\u2019 organization, led and dominated by the elite, tra-",
  "ditionally literate Hindu castes. For the first sixty years of its existence it had",
  "been guided by a Maharashtrian Brahmin \u2013 first K. B. Hedgewar, then M.",
  "S. Golwalkar, finally Balasaheb Deoras. Then in March 1994 a non-Brahmin",
  "from Uttar Pradesh, Rajendra Singh, was appointed head of the organization.",
  "This was a bow not only to the Mandal debate, but also an acknowledgementof the major role played by the backward castes in the Ayodhya movement.",
  "ThecadresoftheShivSenaandtheVHPweremostlydrawnfromthemiddle",
  "castes, and there were a fair number of Dalits as well.",
  "Through this broadening of the base \u2013 in terms of region, gender and,",
  "above all, caste \u2013 was created what might justly be called the \u2018mother of all",
  "votebanks\u2019.IntheearlydaysoftheAyodhyacontroversy,circa 1985-6,VHP",

  "questions of religious identity rather than matters of economic development",
  "orsocialreform.Losingitsholdonthegovernment,winningeverfewerseats",
  "in Parliament, the Congress was now merely reacting to debates initiated by",
  "the BJP. In desperation, it called upon Rajiv Gandhi\u2019s widow Sonia, then liv-",
  "ing a reclusive life with her family in Delhi, to head the party. After she took",
  "charge as Congress president in 1998, Sonia Gandhi worked overtime to dis-",
  "pel the image of her party as \u2018anti-Hindu\u2019. She regularly visited temples, and",
  "even went so far as to participate in the great Kumbh Mela, a congregation",
  "held every twelve years in which tens of millions of Hindus take a dip in the",
  "Ganga at Allahabad.32",
  "While the Ayodhya dispute remained its focus, the Sangh Parivar also",
  "took up other campaigns in the 1990s. More sites were identified where, it",
  "was alleged, Muslims had usurped a Hindu shrine \u2013 in Mathura, in Banaras,",
  "in the Madhya Pradesh town of Dhar, in the Baba Budan hills of Karnataka\u2019s",
  "Chikmaglur district. Movements were launched, with varying success, to \u2018re-",
  "claim\u2019 these places from the \u2018intruders\u2019. Simultaneously a series of attacks",
  "were launched on Christian missionaries, particularly those working in tribal",
  "areas. Churches wereburntandpriests beaten upinbothGujarat andMadhya",

  "a necessary prelude to mobilizing one\u2019s own forces, thus to foster a collect-",

  "much malice aforethought. Sometimes, however, the issue taken up was far-",
  "cical rather than diabolical. In the summer of 2000, for example, the RSS",

  "was being replaced by the call of jihad (holy war). As a popular slogan of the",

  "(This is neither a guerrilla war nor a national liberation struggle; this is jihad,",

  "One consequence of this turn to religion was that the community of",

  "There were an estimated 200,000 Pandits living in the Kashmir Valley.",
  "By the summer of 1990, at least half had left. They lived in refugee camps,",
  "some run by the government, others by the RSS. At first the state\u2019s hope, and",

  "The growing militancy in Kashmir was actively aided by Pakistan. That",
  "country\u2019s Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) ran camps where terrorists were",
  "trained in the use of arms and provided maps of the region. With the ISI\u2019s",
  "help, Kashmiri activists moved freely across the border, into India to kill or",

  "By the mid 1990s the Hizb-ul had been joined by many hundreds of",

  "Ali, were \u2018indoctrination nurseries designed to produce fanatics\u2019. Pakistan",
  "now boasted fifty-eight Islamic political parties and twenty-four armed reli-",
  "gious militias, peopled in the main by the products of the madrasa system.41",
  "The intensification of religious sentiment in Pakistan deepened its com-",
  "mitment to the \u2018liberation\u2019 of Kashmir. Preachers in mosques and madrasas",
  "spoke repeatedly of Indian zulm (terror) in the Kashmir Valley, urging theirfollowers to join the jihad there. Youths so swayed entered groups such as",
  "the Lashkar-i-Toiba, which was rapidly assuming a leading role in the armed",
  "struggle. The proximate aim was the uniting of Kashmir with the Pakistani",
  "nation, this \u2018a religious duty binding not only on the people of Pakistan, but,",
  "in fact, on the entire Muslim ummat [brotherhood]\u2019. A wider ambition was to",
  "catalyse a civil war in India. As the chief of the Lashkar, Hafiz Mohammed",

  "This animosity and hatred was perhaps not unexpected. For the jihadis,",

  "of the JKLF, which wanted independence rather than merger with Pakistan,",
  "and of the People\u2019s Conference, which advocated non-violence.44 The funda-",
  "mentalists also came down hard on the pleasures of the people. Cinema halls",

  "or thereabouts, there were only two functioning institutions in Kashmir \u2013 the",

  "As James Buchan has written, in the years since 1990,",

  "Throughout the 1990s, as Hindu fundamentalism gathered strength in the rest",
  "of India, Islamic fundamentalism was on the ascendant in Kashmir. The two",
  "processes began independently, yet each legitimized and furthered the other.",
  "With every communal riot sparked by the Ayodhya movement, radicals in the",
  "Valley could more easily portray India as a state run for and by Hindus. With",
  "every killing of innocent civilians or Indian soldiers in the Valley, the RSScould point to the hand of Pakistan in fomenting trouble within India. There",

  "After the Babri Masjid came down, Hindu radicals hoped to build a grand",
  "temple in its place. Architects were commissioned to design an edifice in",
  "marble, and craftsmen engaged to cut the stone and polish it. However, the",
  "site itself remained in the custody of the state. Cases were being heard in",
  "the Allahabad High Court and the Supreme Court, to decide whether a Ram",
  "temple had ever existed here, and whether the VHP had (as it claimed) the",
  "legal rights to the land surrounding the old mosque. Attempts were also made",

  "However, at the site itself the status quo prevailed. The courts took their",
  "time disposing of the matter, and no compromise could be reached outside",
  "them either. Meanwhile the Vishwa Hindu Parishad organized tours of Ayod-",
  "hya by kar sevaks from all over the country. They also held religious cere-",
  "monies in anticipation of the building of the temple. One such yagna, held",
  "in the last week of February 2002, was attended by hundreds of volunteers",
  "from the state of Gujarat. On their way back home by train, these kar sevaks",
  "got into a fight with Muslim vendors at the Godhra railway station. The",
  "vendors were asked to chant slogans in homage to Lord Ram; when they re-fused, their beards were pulled. Word of the altercation spread; young men",
  "from the Muslim neighbourhood outside the station joined in. The kar sevaks",

  "tion.",
  "Godhra was a town with along history of communal violence; it had ex-",
  "perienced serious riots in 1949, and again in 1981. That Hindus and Muslims",
  "had not always been on the best of terms, and that the Ayodhya problem had",
  "strained relations further, is clear. It is also beyond dispute that the incident at",
  "thestationwassparkedbykarsevakstauntingMuslimvendors.Whatremains",
  "unclear is the cause of the fire afterwards. The VHP claimed that it was the",
  "handiwork of a Muslim mob. On the other hand, forensic evidence suggests",
  "that it originated inside the carriage, and was probably the result of a gas cyl-",
  "inder or paraffin stove accidentally catching fire.51",
  "Word that a group of kar sevaks had been burnt to death at Godhra",

  "Once known for their philanthropic industrialists and progressive intellectu-",
  "als, once centres of technical innovation and artistic excellence, both places",
  "had experienced a prolonged period of economic decline. With this came a",
  "deterioration in inter-community relations. Hindus and Muslims now rarely",
  "worked or played together, a separation that had in the recent past expressed",
  "itself in bouts of communal violence.52",
  "TheselatestriotsinBarodaandAhmedabadwereunprecedented intheir",
  "savagery. Muslim shops and offices were attacked, mosques torched and cars",
  "vandalized. Muslim women were raped, Muslim men killed and bonfires",
  "made of their bodies. The mobs were often led by activists of the VHP, with",
  "the local administration in collusion. Their weapons ranged from swords and",
  "gunstopetrol bombsandgascylinders. Thevandals hadvoterlists, whichal-",
  "lowed them to identify which homes were Muslim and which were not. Min-",
  "isters of the state government were camped in police control rooms, directing",
  "operations. The police had been instructed to give \u2018free run of the roads to",
  "VHP and Bajrang Dal mobs\u2019.53",
  "BeyondBarodaandAhmedabad,theviolencealsoreachedoutintosmal-",

  "the countryside in tractors and jeeps, targeting properties owned by Muslims.",
  "The numerical record of their activities is available: \u2018altogether, 2161 houses,",
  "1461 shops, 304 smaller enterprises . . . 71 factories, 38 hotels, 45 religiousplaces and 240 vehicles were completely or partially destroyed\u2019.54 What was",
  "true of Sabarkantha was broadly true of the state as a whole. The VHP had",
  "made it clear that it wanted to render the Muslims hopeless as well as home-",
  "less. Thus in Ahmedabad, weeks after the riots had subsided Muslims still",
  "found it difficult to get loans from banks, gas and phone connections and en-",

  "The chief minister of Gujarat at the time of the 2002 riots was Narendra",
  "Modi, a hard-line Hindutva ideologue who had grown up in the unforgiving",
  "school of the RSS. Now, he justified the violence on Muslims by pointing to",
  "the burning of the railway coach in Godhra, which, he said, had set in motion",
  "a \u2018chain of action and reaction\u2019. In truth, the reaction was many times that of",
  "the original action. More than 2,000 Muslims were killed, and at least fifty",
  "times that number rendered homeless, living in refugee camps whose pitiable",
  "condition was noticed by the prime minister and president themselves.56",
  "The Oxford English Dictionary defines \u2018pogrom\u2019 as \u2018an organized mas-",
  "sacre of a particular ethnic group\u2019. By this definition, while there have been",
  "hundredsofinter-religiousriotsinthehistoryofindependentIndia,therehave",

  "Muslims who were killed by Hindu mobs were completely innocent of the",
  "Godhra crime (which may anyway have been an accident).",
  "In both cases the pogroms were made possible by the willed breakdown",
  "of the rule of law. The prime minister in Delhi in 1984, and the chief minister",
  "in Gujarat in 2002, issued graceless statements that in effect justified the",
  "killings. And serving ministers in their government went so far as to aid and",
  "direct the rioters.",
  "The final similarity is the most telling, as well as perhaps the most de-",

  "reduce to rubble the edifice of our hopes and aspirations as a people and as a",
  "nation.57",
  "These worries were shared by the Western press. \u2018Like the three domes",
  "that crowned the 464-year-old Babri mosque\u2019, wrote Time magazine, \u2018the",
  "three pillars of the Indian state \u2013 democracy, secularism and the rule of law",
  "\u2013 are now at risk from the fury of religious nationalism\u2019.58 The day after the",
  "mosque came down, The Times of London carried a story with the headline",
  "\u2018Militants Bury Hope of Harmony in Rubble of Indian Mosque\u2019. The next",
  "day\u2019s paper quoted the views of the Labour politician Jack Straw, then on a",
  "visit to Bombay. Straw thought that there was a real danger that India would",
  "slide \u2018into the abyss of sectarianism\u2019. The same issue carried a leading article",
  "by the Irish intellectual Conor Cruise O\u2019Brien, which confidently proclaimed",

  "These were the immediate, so to say knee-jerk, responses of excitable",
  "journalists and professional cynics (O\u2019Brien had previously predicted that the",
  "fall of the Berlin Wall would lead to the revival of a cult of Hitler and of a",
  "party based on Nazi ideals). But writers trained to take the long view also",
  "echoedthesefears.ABritishauthorwhohadwrittenmanyaffectionatebooks",
  "about the subcontinent remarked that \u2018all who care about that country musttremble for the future of its secular democracy\u2019.60 And an American scholar",
  "who had spent a lifetime studying India went so far as to compare the Sangh",
  "Parivar to the Nazis: \u2018It is past time to note\u2019, wrote Paul Brass, \u2018that Indian",
  "politics and society display many of the symptoms of a murderous pre-fascist",
  "stage which has already produced a multiplicity of localized Kristall-nachts",
  "in numerous urban sites.\u2019 The \u2018spread of violence, lawlessness and disorder",
  "at the local level, thought Brass, might prompt the central government (then",
  "controlled by the Congress) into \u2018another venture into authoritarian practices\u2019",
  ". And so the \u2018Indian state may yet disintegrate in this clash between secular",
  "opportunists and chauvinist nationalists equally tied to the pursuit of illusions",
  "andchimeras,\u201csymbolsandshadows\u201dofnationalunityandgreatnesspursued",
  "by all the tyrannical regimes of the twentieth century .61",
  "At the time of writing (2008), these dire predictions have not come to",
