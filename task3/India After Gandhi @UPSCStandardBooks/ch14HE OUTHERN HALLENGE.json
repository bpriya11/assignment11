  "ing known to some as the \u2018Sepoy Mutiny\u2019 and to others as the \u2018First War of",
  "Indian Independence\u2019.",
  "Like 1757 and 1857, 1957 was also a year of momentous importance in",
  "the history of modern India. For it was in that year that India held its second",
  "generalelection.AftertheendoftheSecondWorldWar,dozensofAfricanand",
  "Asian nations won freedom from their European colonizers. From their incep-",

  "ruledbycommunists,themilitaryorunaffiliateddictators.Indiawasoneofthe",
  "very few exceptions and, because of its size and social complexity, the really",
  "remarkable one. Before and after the great gamble of 1952 a series of provin-",
  "cial elections were held, in which the verdict of the ballot was honoured. Still,",
  "for India to certifiably join the league of democracies there had to be a second",
  "general election to follow the first. This was held over a period of three weeks",
  "in the spring of 1957.",
  "Sukumar Sen still served as chief election commissioner. Though fortuit-",

  "less than half actually did. The ballots they marked collectively consumed",
  "197 tonnes of paper. Keeping them in line were 273,762 policemen, aided by",

  "As in 1952, the 1957 election was in essence a referendum on the prime min-",
  "ister and his ruling party. Nehru was, again, the chief ideologue, propagand-",
  "ist and vote-catcher for the Congress. Helping him behind the scenes was his",
  "only child, Indira Gandhi. Estranged from her husband Feroze, she and her",
  "two sons stayed with her widowed father in his spacious official residence,",
  "Teen Murti House.2 Mrs Gandhi was often the last person the prime minister",
  "saw in the evening and the first he saw in the morning. Serving as his officialhostess,shemetandmixedwiththehighofthislandandofmanyothers.Her",
  "health, previously frail, had noticeably improved. Contemporary photographs",
  "show her once sickly frame to have filled out; the improvement obvious not",
  "just in her appearance, but in her manner as well. A recent biographer has",
  "linked this improvement to the new antibiotic drugs then entering the market,",
  "which cured the tuberculosis shewas thought to suffer from. 3",

  "cialists on the left. Both those parties were now in disarray, caused in part",
  "by the departure of their charismatic leaders. S. P. Mookerjee was dead and",
  "Jayaprakash Narayan had abandoned politics for social service. Across north-ern India the Congress was virtually unchallenged. It won 195 seats in the",

  "the Congress was opposed by the Ganatantra Parishad \u2013 a grouping of loc-",
  "al landlords \u2013 which, with the parties of the left, reduced it to a tally of 7",
  "seats out of 20. In Bombay province, once the heartland of Indian national-",

  "were reproduced in the local elections which followed, with the Samiti cap-",
  "turing the municipalities of the great historic cities of Poona and Bombay.",
  "A regional challenge was also brewing in the south. This took the shape",
  "of the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (or DMK), a party which grew out of the",
  "Dravidian movement started by E. V. Ramaswami Naicker. Known as \u2018Peri-",

  "From the late nineteenth century Kerala had been in a state of social fer-",
  "ment. These changes were being directed by four kinds of actors. First, there",
  "were the missionaries who, because of the Christian influence, found it easi-",
  "er to work here than in other parts of British India. Their Churches promoted",
  "modern education through a vast, interconnected network of schools and col-",
  "leges.Second,therewerethesuccessiveMaharajasofCochinand(especially)",

  "ergeticcasteassociations,suchastheNairServiceSociety,whichrepresented",
  "thedominant landed caste; andtheSreeNarayana Dharma Paripalana, named",
  "for Narayana Guru, the legendary leader of the Ezhavas, the caste of toddy-",
  "tappers ranked low in the ritual hierarchy. These too ran their educational in-",
  "stitutions, as well as societies devoted to welfare and charity. Finally, there",
  "werethepoliticalparties,whichincludedtheCongress,ofcourse,andalsothe",
  "Communist Party of India.8",
  "The Kerala unit of the CPI was strongly rooted in the local soil. Its most",
  "influential leaders had started life in the Congress, then graduated leftwards.",
  "They started peasant unions to demand security for tenants and labour unions",
  "to demand better wages and working conditions for the landless. They insti-",
  "tuted \u2018reading rooms\u2019 where intellectuals communicated radical ideas to their",
  "underprivileged audiences. Theatre and dance were also pressed into the ser-",
  "vice of left-wing propaganda. Through the late 1930s and beyond the com-",
  "munists made steady gains, their ideas and manifest idealism appealing to a",
  "divided society further hit by depression and war.",
  "In a country generally riven by inequality, Kerala still stood out for",
  "the oppressiveness of its caste system. Here, the lowest of the low were not",
  "merely \u2018untouchable\u2019 , but even \u2018unseeable\u2019 . When a Namboodiri Brahmin",
  "approached,aParaiyalabourerhadtocryoutinadvance,lestthesightofhim",
  "pollute his superior. Yet the combined efforts of the missionaries, the princes,",
  "the caste societies and the communists had seriously undermined traditional",
  "structures of authority. In a mere half-century, between 1900 and 1950, de-",
  "fiance had replaced deference as the idiom of social exchange in the Kerala",
  "countryside.9",
  "When, after 1947, universal suffrage came to the state, the communists",
  "were in a very goodposition to exploit it. But instead they went underground,followingordersfromMoscow.Theyresurfacedintimeforthe1952election,",
  "and made a decent showing. Through the 1950s they worked steadily at ex-",
  "panding their influence. In February 1956, less than a year before the Indian",
  "general election, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union had its 20th Con-",
  "gress. Here Khrushchev famously denounced Stalin, and in passing also en-",
  "dorsed the possibility of a peaceful transition to socialism. In the general sec-",
  "retary\u2019s words, \u2018The winning of a stable parliamentary majority backed by a",
  "mass revolutionary movement of the proletariat and of all the working people",
  "could create for the working class of a number of capitalist and former colo-",
  "nial countries the conditions needed to secure fundamental social changes.\u201910",
  "There would, of course, be no elections in the Soviet Union, but Big",
  "Brother now did not mind, indeed perhaps approved of, participation in elec-",
  "tions by comrades elsewhere. (This shift was caused in part by imperatives of",
  "foreign policy \u2013 competing with their fellow superpower for allies, the Russi-",
  "ans had to cultivate ex-colonial regimes that were of ten unsympathetic to re-",
  "volutionary communism.) The communists in Kerala could now throw them-",
  "selves more energetically into their campaign. Their manifesto declared that",
  "they wished only to make this a \u2018democratic and prosperous state\u2019 , by start-",
  "ing new industries, increasing food production, raising wages of workers in",
  "factories and farms, nationalizing plantations, building houses and streamlin-",
  "ing schools. The party of protest sought to become a party of governance; a",
  "transitionwhich,ittoldthevoter,itsstewardshipoflocalbodieshadprepared",
  "it for. As the manifesto declared,",
  "the people also know that the administration of many municipalities and",
  "of the Malabar District Board under the leadership of the Communist",
  "Party is better than before, and that both the panchayats [village coun-",
  "cils]whichwonawardsfromPrimeMinisterNehruforgoodadministra-",
  "tion are under the leadership of the Communist Party. These experiences",
  "have made it clear that the Communist Party is capable not only of unit-",
  "ing the people for conducting agitation, but that it can also take over and",
  "run the administration successfully.11",
  "V",
  "The newly elected Communist chief minister of Kerala was E. M. S. Nam-",
  "boodiripad.\u2018EMS\u2019,ashewasknowntofoeandfriendalike,wasasmallman,barely five feet tall, but with a deep commitment to his credo, this allied to",
  "a fierce intelligence. Born in a Brahmin family, he had donated his ancestral",
  "home to the party. He read widely and wrote prodigiously - among his many",
  "works was an authoritative history of Kerala. Like Sheikh Abdullah, Master",
  "TaraSinghandA.Z.Phizo,EMSwas,inthishugecountry,consideredamere",
  "\u2018provincial\u2019 leader. Yet he remains a figure of considerable historical interest,",
  "because of both the size of his province and the distinctiveness of his polit-",
  "ics.12",
  "Virtually the first act of the new government was to commute the sen-",
  "tences of prisoners on death row. Next, cases were withdrawn against those",
  "involved in labour disputes or other such \u2018political struggles\u2019. More substant-",
  "ive measures were to follow, such as the opening of thousands of \u2018fair price\u2019",
  "shops, to aid the distribution of food to the needy in a food-deficient state.13",
  "Thecommunistministersmadeanimpressionwiththeirefficiency,thisa",

  "to land reform; a commitment which, as Ronald Herring has noted, \u2018did not",
  "become operative under any Congress regime but was closely approximated",
  "by the reforms of the Communist Party of India in Kerala\u2019.16",
  "The aims of the Agrarian Relations Bill introduced by EMS\u2019s govern-",
  "ment were modest: not the socialization or collectivization of land, not even",
  "thebestowingoflandtitlestothelandless,merelytheprovidingofstabilityoftenuretothemassofsmallpeasantswhocultivatedholdingsownedbyabsent-",
  "ee landlords. The bill sought to curb the wide powers of eviction previously",
  "enjoyed by landlords, to reduce rates of rent and waive arrears, and to fix a",
  "ceiling on ownership and redistribute the surplus land thus garnered. These",
  "wereimportantmeasures,helpinghundredsofthousandsofpoorpeasants,but",
  "still somewhat short of what the Red catechism prescribed. The contradiction",
  "was resolved by recourse to the \u2018stages\u2019 theory of classical Marxism. It was",
  "argued that rural India was still \u2018semi-feudal\u2019. All non-feudal classes were to",
  "be rallied around the proposed reforms which, when in place, would unleash",
  "agrarian capitalism, the next, necessary stop in the high road to socialism.17",
  "The standard history of Kerala communism is subtitled \u2018a study in polit-",
  "ical adaptation\u2019 (to bourgeois democracy). Reformism in agriculture was",
  "one manifestation of this; a second, which must surely have confused the",
  "cadres more, was the encouragement of private enterprise. The party\u2019s mani-",
  "festo had threatened the nationalization of plantations, many of them foreign-",
  "owned. After the election this was quietly abandoned. Then, within its first",
  "few months in office, the Kerala government invited India\u2019s largest capitalist",
  "house, the Birlas, to setup a rayon factory in Mavoor. The entrepreneurs were",
  "assured subsidized supplies of bamboo \u2013 to be gifted to the Birlas at one",
  "rupee per tonne, when the prevailing market price was perhaps a thousand",
  "times as much. This project constituted, on the capitalist\u2019s side, a breaking",
  "of ranks, for the Indian industrial class detested the communists. Their hope",
  "wasthatthecentralgovernmentwouldbelikewiseexercisedbytheRedmen-",
  "ace; that \u2018Home Minister Pant and his New Delhi group [of Congress politi-",
  "cians] comes down on the Kerala Communists with a heavy hand and knocks",
  "them out of office\u2019.18 The pragmatic Birlas, however, were responding to the",
  "factthattheCPIcontrolledtradeunionsinimportantindustrialcentresoutside",
  "Kerala. To start a plant here was to buy peace here \u2013 as well as elsewhere. As",
  "one columnist archly commented, it was hard to believe that the clan\u2019s patri-",
  "arch, Ghanshyamdas Birla, had succumbed to the \u2018superlative charm of Chief",
  "Minister Namboodiripad\u2019; it was more likely that he was \u2018getting ready for a",
  "Communist triumph in Bengal, where his interests are concentrated\u2019.19",
  "In office, as in opposition, the communists attracted a wide range of in-",
  "terested comment, this ranging from the warmly approbatory to the viciously",
  "hostile. There were those who wrote of an emerging new dawn, in terms re-",
  "miniscent of the opening pages of George Orwell\u2019s Homage to Catalonia,",
  "with its sincere salute to the soul of man under socialism. On the first an-",

  "of the clergy and the nobility were abolished. Mines, railways and banks",

  "Old version: Lenin established a Workers\u2019 Government. But the first",
  "election showed that the Bolsheviks had no majority. However, to main-",
  "tain themselves in power, they dissolved the Duma on the ground that it",
  "was reactionary. Local Soviets who did not support the Bolsheviks were",
  "also disbanded. Private schools were forbidden and education was taken",
  "over by the State. Voting right was denied to the nobility and the clergy.",
  "Communism encourages violence, and does not believe in an omnipo-",

  "Here were two alternative visions of the kind of society Kerala should be-",
  "come; masquerading as two alternative readings of the Russian Revolution.",
  "One can see how the Christian version would enrage the Communists, and",
  "vice versa. Inanyevent, the textbook rowadded fuel toanalready well-burn-",
  "ing fire. For by this time the Christians opposing the bill had been joined by",
  "theNairs,theothercommunity thatloomedlargeintheeconomic lifeofKer-",
  "ala. Where the Christians had always supported the Congress, the Nairs were",
  "split down the middle; about half of them had voted for the communists, the",
  "other half against. However, since the Nair Service Society also ran schools",
  "and colleges, the new bill helped tilt them against the communists and into a",
  "somewhat opportunistic alliance with theChristians.26",
  "More opportunistic still was the local Congress Party. Defeated in the",
  "election, it saw in the resentment against the Educational Bill a chance to re-",
  "gain power. Its leaders proposed an anti-communist popular front, an idea at-",
  "tractive to \u2018the reactionary Catholic Church, landlords, planters and the other",
  "disgruntled elements\u2019, but a seeming betrayal of the socialistic philosophy of",
  "its leaders at the centre.27 Through the latter part of 1958 there were a series",
  "of strikes and protest marches in Kerala. In one incident in Trichur the police",
  "fired on a crowd of Congress Party members, killing six.28",
  "Feeling besieged, E. M. S. Namboodiripad was compelled to state his",
  "case through the pages of the country\u2019s most popular English-language",
  "weekly. Their \u2018opponents were scandalised\u2019, he said, because his government",
  "sometimes sought to act against the landlords, even if it did so strictly withinthe framework of the constitution. A Congress leader answered back, writing",
  "inthesamecolumnsaboutthegrowing\u2018lawlessnessandinsecurityinKerala\u2019",
  ", caused by the tendency of communists to raise themselves above the law",
  "while acting vindictively against those who did not agree withthem.29 After",

  "Gandhi was elected president of the Indian National Congress. She was the",

  "her domestic duties would suffer, Mrs Gandhi answered with asperity: \u2018My",
  "household work takes ten minutes only.\u201930",
  "At this time the Congress was \u2018speaking with three voices: the members",

  "active in its schools and colleges, Mannath was an austere, dhoti-clad man",
  "who spoke only Malayalam. It was said that he had turned against the com-",
  "munists when they refused permission for him to start an engineering college",

  "not merely from Kerala, but from India and driv[e] them to their fatherland \u2013",
  "Russia\u2019. When an interviewer asked whether his age was not against him (he",
  "was eighty), Mannath reminded them of Bhishma Pitamah, the octogenarian",
  "warriorwhohadledthePandavasintotheirowndharmayuddh,orholywar.32",
  "The clash in Kerala is perhaps best understood in terms of the political",
  "theorist W. H. Morris-Jones\u2019s characterization of the three \u2018idioms\u2019 of Indian",
  "politics. The first of these idioms was the \u2018modern\u2019, basing itself on universal",
  "ideas offreedom andjustice, andexpressed inParliament, thelawcourts,and",
  "the English-language press. The second was the \u2018traditional\u2019, which emphas-",
  "ized primordial loyalties, the interests of one\u2019s caste or religion.",
  "In its first phase the Education Bill controversy was, like so much else",
  "inmodernIndia,simply aclash between themodernandtraditional idioms of",
  "politics. But Mannath Padmanabhan brought with him yet a third idiom: the",
  "\u2018saintly\u2019 .Morris-Jones himself sawthisidiom asoperating \u2018atthemargin\u2019 of",
  "Indian politics \u2013 as in the social work of Vinoba Bhave. Mannath, however,",
  "brought this idiom into a direct engagement with the other two \u2013 as,long be-",
  "fore, and to even more spectacular effect, had Mahatma Gandhi. The people",
  "of Kerala followed him in part for the same reasons that the people of India",
  "had followed Gandhi; namely, that his personal integrity was unimpeachable,",
  "and that he had never sought or held political office.33Mannath\u2019s arrival gave a huge boost to the movement, which soon con-",
  "tained, in the patriarch\u2019s words, \u2018everyone in Kerala who is not a Commun-",
  "ist\u2019. On 1 May 1959 a conference of community organizations met at Chan-",
  "ganacherry to form a Vimochana Samara Samiti, or Liberation Committee,",
  "under Mannath\u2019s leadership. Over the next month its members carried their",
  "message into schools and colleges, churches and temples, into the homes of",
  "fisherfolk, peasants, merchants and workers.",
  "By early June thousands of volunteers were ready to court arrest. Now",
  "commenced aseriesofhartals,orshut-downstrikes,leadingtotheclosureof",
  "schools, hospitals, public offices and factories. Large processions were taken",

  "were 248 lathi-charges by police; also many bullets fired, leaving at least",
  "twenty dead and many more wounded, children and women among them.",
  "Each lathi-charge served only to swell further the ranks of the protesters.",
  "Some 150,000 protesters were jailed; a quarter of these were women.34",

  "It is hard to say who found the situation more distasteful \u2013 E. M. S. Nam-",

  "werepressingforthecentretoinvokeArticle356oftheconstitution,whereby",
  "the president could dismiss a state government on account of a breakdown in",
  "law and order. The article had been used four times in the past, usually to call",
  "mid-term elections when a ruling party had lost its majority on account of a",
  "split or defections.",
  "To see the situation for himself, Nehru visited Kerala in the last week of",
  "June1959.Hewasalarmedatthe\u2018thickwallsofgrouphatred\u2019;thetwosides,",
  "he thought, were almost like two hostile countries at war.36 But he remainedreluctanttoaskthepresidenttodismissEMS\u2019sgovernment.Hishesitancywas",
  "not shared by his daughter Indira, who thought the action was long overdue:",
  "\u2018When Kerala is virtually on fire\u2019 , said Mrs Gandhi in a speech in Delhi, \u2018it",
  "becomes the centre\u2019s duty to go to the aid of the people; the misrule of the",
  "communist rulers of the state has created a situation which is unparalleled in",
  "the history of our country. Such a situation does not brook legal quibbling.\u201937",
  "Mannath and his warriors were now preparing for a final showdown.",
  "The Muslim League had joined the struggle, lending it more legitimacy still.",
  "Through the month of July there were daily marches, with the protesters pro-",
  "voking the police into violence. In one particularly gruesome incident the po-",
  "lice entered a fishing hamlet and fired on bystanders, killing a pregnant wo-",
  "man and two others near her.38",
  "TheVimochana Samara Samiti haddeclared 9August\u2018ZeroDay\u2019,when",
  "50,000 volunteers, representing all classes and communities, would descend",
  "on Trivandrum to paralyse the administration. On 26 July groups started",
  "marching on the capital from all parts of the state, gathering momentum",
  "and men along the way. \u2018The hour was approaching when the Communists",
  "mustchoosebetweenmassacreanddefeat.\u201939Aletterfromthestategovernor,",
  "pleading with the centre to intervene, strengthened the hand of the Congress",

  "writing to Namboodiripad on 30 July that an order of dismissal was on the",
  "way, since \u2018it is no longer possible to allow matters to deteriorate, leading to",
  "continuing conflicts and human suffering. We have felt that, even from the",
  "point of view of your government, it is better for Central intervention to take",
  "place now\u2019.40",
  "SixmonthslaterKeralawenttothepollsagain.TheCongress,alliedwith",
  "theSocialistPartyandtheMuslimLeague,askedthevotertochoosebetween",
  "\u2018democracy and communism\u2019. Nehru led a band of stalwarts in a campaign",
  "which featured posters of Flory Mata, the pregnant fisherwoman shot by the",
  "police during the \u2018liberation struggle\u2019. A record 84 per cent of the adult pop-",
  "ulation turned out to vote. In a House of 127 the communists won only 26",
  "seats. The Congress won 60; their allies a further 31.41 The results appeared",
  "to vindicate the dismissal of Namboodiripad\u2019s government. But, as Sarvepalli",
  "Gopal points out, that decision had \u2018tarnished Nehru\u2019s reputation for ethical",
  "behaviour in politics and, from a long-term view, weakened his position\u2019.42",

  "Congress had successfully tamed these threats; by drafting a democratic con-",
  "stitution, winning a democratic election and putting in place the rudiments of",
  "a modern pluralist state.",
  "Now, a decade later, the Congress was once more under attack from the",
  "far edges of the political spectrum. The left\u2019s challenge this time was demo-",
  "cratic, and hence potentially more dangerous. For if EMS\u2019s government was",
  "to bring about social reform successfully, by redistributing land to the poor",
  "andcreatingschoolsforall,itmightcreateadominoeffect,thatis,thevictory",
  "of non-Congress parties in other states of the Union.",
  "Asithappened,therewasalsoanewchallengefromtheright.Thiscame",
  "from C. Rajagopalachari, \u2018Rajaji\u2019, the veteran Congress politician who had",
  "previouslyservedasgovernorofBengal,governorgeneralofIndiaandUnion",
  "home minister. In 1952 the Congress asked Rajaji to take over as chief minis-",
  "terofMadrasprovince.HestayedinthatpostuntilApril1954,whenhisparty",
  "indicated that they wanted the powerful backward-caste leader K. Kamaraj to",
  "replace him. Now Rajaji settled down in a small house to spend his days, he",
  "said, reading and writing. (He was an accomplished short-story writer in his",
  "nativeTamil,andhadalsowrittenmasterfulversionsoftheRamayanaandthe",
  "Mahabharata.)",
  "However, philosophy and literature proved inadequate substitutes for",
  "public affairs. Thus Rajaji was moved to comment from time to time on the",
  "nuclear arms race between Russia and America, with regard to which he took",
  "a line not dissimilar to Nehru\u2019s. Then, when the second five-year plan com-",
  "mitted the government of India to a socialist model of economics, he began",
  "commenting on domestic affairs too. Here, however, he came to be increas-",
  "ingly at odds with the prime minister.",
  "The differences were in part political. Rajaji felt that the Congress had",
  "become complacent in the absence of a strong opposition. In October 1956",
  "he made public his belief that there should be an opposition group within the",
  "Congress, without which \u2013 so he feared \u2013 the party \u2018would simply degenerate",
  "intoahuntinggroundforeverykindofambitionandself-seeking\u2019.43Thepro-",
  "posal was rejected; so the veteran turned to promoting an opposition outside",
  "the Congress instead. In May 1958 he published an article with the provocat-",
  "ivetitle\u2018Wanted:IndependentThinking\u2019.Thisarguedthat\u2018probablythemaincause for the collapse of independent thinking\u2019 in India was \u2018the long reign",
  "of popular favourites without any significant opposition\u2019. However, a healthy",
  "democracy required \u2018an opposition that thinks differently and does not just",
  "want more of the same, a group of vigorously thinking citizens which aims",
  "at the general welfare, and not one that in order to get more votes from the",
  "so-calledhave-nots,offersmoretothemthanthepartyinpowerhasgiven,an",
  "opposition that appeals to reason . . .\u201944",
  "The differences between Nehru and Rajaji were also economic. Rajaji",
  "worried that the second five-year plan would lead to an excessive centraliz-",
  "ation of state power. He was disturbed by the massive increases in taxation,",
  "conceived in the interests of the public sector, but which might only serve to",
  "\u2018discourage and deject citizens and wither the private sector\u2019. In his view, the",
  "plan must \u2018be conceived as a supplement to rather than a substitute for the",
  "market economy\u2019.45",
  "In May 1959, and touching eighty, Rajaji launched a new political party,",
  "the Swatantra Party. This party focused its criticisms on the \u2018personality cult\u2019",
  "around the prime minister, and on the economic policies of the ruling Con-",
  "gress. Its founding statement asked for a \u2018proper decentralized distribution of",
  "industry\u2019throughthenurturingof\u2018competitiveenterprise\u2019and,inagriculture,",
  "for the encouragement of the \u2018self-employed peasant proprietor who stands",
  "for initiative and freedom\u2019. It rejected the \u2018techniques of so-called socialism\u2019",
  "and the \u2018bringing into being of \u201cStatism\u201d.\u201946",
  "A democracy run by a single party automatically becomes a tyranny;",
  "such was Rajaji\u2019s rationale for starting Swatantra. For \u2018the Congress Party",
  "has so far run without a true Opposition. It has run with accelerators and no",
  "brakes.\u201947 This party started by an octogenarian quickly gathered momentum.",
  "Those whojoined upincluded captains ofindustry,naturally,but also peasant",
  "leaders worried by Congress threats to promote \u2018co-operative farming\u2019. Al-",
  "though conventionally described as \u2018conservative\u2019, the party was in fact a",
  "curious amalgam of free-market liberals and agrarian leaders seeking an al-",
  "ternative to the Congress.48",
  "Congresscheerleaders dismissedSwatantraasapartyof\u2018rightreaction\u2019.",
  "The prime minister himself affected an airy disdain. When asked at a press",
  "conference about Rajaji\u2019s newparty, he merely joked, \u2018He likes the Old Testa-",
  "ment. I like the NewTestament.\u201949",
  "IXThe challenges posed by the communists on the left and the Swatantra Party",
  "ontherightwerecompoundedbyseriousaccusationsoffinancialmalfeasance",
  "against the government in New Delhi. In September 1957 questions were",
  "raised in Parliament about the propriety of large investments made by the",
  "state-owned Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) in a private firm in",
  "Kanpurownedbyanindustrialist named Haridas Mundhra.Whenthefinance",
  "minister, T. T. Krishnamachari, gave an equivocal reply, dissident Congress",

  "He wondered how \u2018the Life Insurance Corporation became a willing party to",
  "this questionable transaction with the mystery man of India\u2019s business under-",
  "world\u2019 . There was, Feroze Gandhi concluded, \u2018a conspiracy to beguile the",
  "[state-owned] Corporation of its funds\u2019.50",
  "Bowingtothecriticism,thegovernmentannouncedaCommissionofIn-",
  "quiry into the affair. In fact there were two separate and successive enquiries,",
  "each headed by an eminent judge. Their findings were not complimentary to",
  "the Congress government. The LIC had a publicly stated \u2018blue-chip\u2019 policy,",
  "which committed it to investing money only in firms of high reputation and",
  "sound management. The Mundhra companies were neither; yet the Corpora-",
  "tion had seen fit to make its largest ever investment in its stock. The officials",
  "quizzedbythejudgescouldnotsatisfactorilyexplaintheirdecision;norcould",

  "The proceedings of these Commissions were held in Delhi and Bombay,",
  "and kept open to the public. They attracted great attention, most of it critical.",
  "People flocked to the hearings, there to see the minister and his officials",
  "fumble under questioning or contradict one another. The final reports of the",
  "judges were damning, and exacted a price: both the minister and his secretary",
  "were forced to demit office.51",
  "The judicial probe into the LIC investment in the Mundhra companies,",
  "wrote the Hindustan Times, \u2018had the effect of an overall political shake-up,",
