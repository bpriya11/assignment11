  "IIFromtheearly1930stheCongresshadinsistedthatIndianswouldframetheir",
  "own constitution. In 1946 Lord Wavell finally gave in to the demand. The",
  "members of the Assembly were chosen on the basis of that year\u2019s provincial",
  "elections. However, the Muslim League chose to boycott the early sittings,",
  "making it effectively a one-party forum.",
  "The first meeting of the Constituent Assembly was held on 9 December",
  "1946. A sense of anticipation was in the air. The leading Congress members,",
  "such as Nehru and Patel, sat on the front benches. But to demonstrate that it",
  "was not merely a Congress Party show, known opponents such as Sarat Bose",
  "ofBengalweregivenseatsalongsidethem.Anationalistnewspapernotedthat",
  "\u2018nine women members were present, adding colour\u2019 to a scene dominated by",
  "Gandhi caps and Nehru jackets.1",
  "Apart from the members sent by the provinces of British India, the Con-",
  "stituent Assembly also had representatives of the princely states, sent as these",
  "states joined the Union one by one. Eighty-two per cent of Assembly mem-",
  "bers were also members of the Congress. However, since the party was itself",
  "a broad church they held a wide range of views. Some were atheists and sec-",
  "ularists, others \u2018technically members of the Congress but spiritually members",
  "of the RSS and the Hindu Mahasabha\u2019.2 Some were socialists in their eco-",
  "nomic philosophy, others defenders of the rights of landlords. Aside from the",
  "diversity within it, the Congress also nominated independent members of dif-",
  "ferent caste and religious groups and ensured the representation of women. It",
  "particularly sought out experts in the law. In the event \u2018there was hardly any",
  "shade of public opinion not represented in the Assembly\u20193",
  "This expansion of the social base of the Assembly was in part an answer",
  "to British criticism. Winston Churchill in particular had poured scorn on the",
  "idea of a Constituent Assembly dominated by \u2018one major community in In-",
  "dia\u2019,thecaste Hindus.InhisviewtheCongress wasnotatrulyrepresentative",

  "since lost all effective connection\u2019.4",
  "The procefss was made more participatory by asking for submissions",
  "from the public at large. There were hundreds of responses, a sampling of",
  "which gives a clue to the interests the law-makers had to take account of.",
  "Thus the All-India Varnashrama Swarajya Sangh (based in Calcutta) asked",
  "that the constitution \u2018be based on the principles laid down in ancient Hindu",
  "works\u2019. The prohibition of cow-slaughter and the closing down of abbatoirs",
  "was particularly recommended. Low-caste groups demanded an end to their\u2018ill treatment by upper-caste people\u2019 and \u2018reservation of separate seats on the",
  "basis of their population in legislature, government departments, and local",
  "bodies,etc.\u2019.Linguisticminoritiesaskedfor\u2018freedomofspeechin[the]moth-",

  "minorities asked for special safeguards. And bodies as varied as the District",
  "Teachers Guild of Vizianagaram and the Central Jewish Board of Bombay",
  "requested \u2018adequate representation . . . on all public bodies including legis-",
  "latures etc.\u20195",
  "These submissions testify to the baffling heterogeneity of India, but also",
  "to the precocious existence of a rights culture among Indians. They were",
  "many; they were divided; above all, they were vocal. The Constitution of In-",
  "dia had to adjudicate among thousands of competing claims and demands.",
  "The task was made no easier by the turmoil of the times. The Assembly met",
  "between 1946 and 1949, against a backdrop of food scarcity, religious riots,",
  "refugee resettlement, class war and feudal intransigence. As one historian of",

  "Nine months later Nehru spoke again in that columned hall, at the mid-",
  "night hour, when he asked Indians to redeem their tryst with destiny. In",
  "between, on 22 July 1947, he had moved a resolution proposing that the na-tional flag of India be a \u2018horizontal tricolour of saffron, white and dark green",
  "in equal proportion, with a wheel in navy blue at the centre. On this occasion",
  "Nehru led a chorus of competitive patriotism, with each subsequent speaker",

  "K. M. Munshi, a Gujarati polymath who was a novelist and lawyer as well",
  "as freedom fighter, and Alladi Krishnaswami Aiyar, a Tamil who for fifteen",
  "years had served as advocate general to the Madras presidency.",
  "To these six men one must add a seventh who was not a member of the",
  "Assembly at all. This was B. N. Rau, who served as constitutional adviser to",
  "the government of India. In along career in the Indian Civil Service Rau had",
  "aseriesoflegalappointments.Usinghislearningandexperience,andfollow-",
  "ing a fresh study-tour of Western democracies, Rau prepared a series of notes",
  "for Ambedkar and his team to chew upon. Rau, in turn, was assisted by the",

  "proposals in the simplest and clearest legal form can rarely be equalled\u2019.10",
  "IVMoral vision, political skill, legal acumen: these were all brought together in",
  "the framing of the Indian Constitution. This was a coming together of what",

  "However, the feisty female member from the United Provinces, Begum",

  "tendencyistowardstherightsofthecitizenasagainstanycorporatebodyand",
  "village panchayats can be very autocratic\u201914",
  "Ultimately it was the individual, rather than the village, that was chosen",
  "as the unit. In other respects, too, the constitution was to look towards Euro-",
  "American rather than Indian precedents. The American presidential system",
  "was considered and rejected, as was the Swiss method of directly electing",
  "Cabinet ministers. Several members argued for proportional representation,",
  "but this was never taken very seriously. Another former British colony, Ire-",
  "land, had adopted PR, but when the constitutional adviser, B. N. Rau, visited",
  "Dublin, Eamon de Valera himself told him that he wished the Irish had ad-",
  "opted the British \u2018first-past-the-post\u2019 system of elections and the British cab-",
  "inet system. This, he felt, made for a strong government. In India, where the",
  "number of competing interest groups was immeasurably larger, it made even",
  "more sense to follow the British model.15 The lower house of Parliament, as",
  "well as the lower houses of the provinces, were to be chosen on the basis ofuniversal adult franchise. After much discussion Parliament, as well as most",
  "provinces, decided also to have a second chamber to act as a check on the ex-",
  "cessesofdemocratic zeal.Itsmemberswerechosenthroughindirectelection,",
  "in the case of the Upper House of Parliament by the state legislatures.",
  "While the Cabinet was headed by a prime minister, the head of state",
  "was a president elected by a college comprising the national and provincial",
  "legislatures. The president would be the commander-in-chief of the armed",
  "forces,andhadthepowertoreferbillsbacktoParliament.Thiswasaposition",
  "of \u2018great authority and dignity\u2019, but, like those of the British monarchy, one",
  "with\u2019no real power\u2019.16 (In the provinces a governor nominated by the \u2018centre\u2019",
  "(ascentral governmentwascomingtobeknown)playedarolecomparable to",
  "the president\u2019s.) The constitution provided for an independent election com-",
  "mission, and an independent comptroller general of accounts. To protect the",
  "judiciary from party politics, judges were to be appointed by the president in",
  "consultation with the chief justice, while their salaries were not decided by",
  "Parliament but charged directly to the Treasury. The Supreme Court in Delhi",
  "was seen both as the guardian of the social revolution and as the guarantor of",
  "civil and minority rights. It was endowed with broad appellate jurisdiction \u2013",
  "any civil or criminal case could be referred to it so long as it involved an in-",
  "terpretation of the constitution.",
  "The constitution mandated for a complex system of fiscal federalism. In",
  "the case of some taxes (for instance customs duties and company taxes) the",
  "centre retained all the proceeds; in other cases (such as income taxes and ex-",
  "cise duties) it shared them with the states; in still other cases (e.g. estate du-",
  "ties) it assigned them wholly to the states. The states, meanwhile, could levy",
  "andcollect certain taxes ontheir own:these included landandpropertytaxes,",
  "sales tax, and the hugely profitable tax on bottled liquor.",
  "These financial provisions borrowed heavily from the Government of",
  "India Act of 1935. The \u2018conscience of the constitution\u2019,17 meanwhile, was",
  "contained in Parts III and IV, which outlined a series of fundamental rights",
  "and directive principles. The fundamental rights, which were enforceable in",
  "a court of law, derived from the obligations of the state not to encroach upon",
  "or stifle personal liberty, and to protect individuals and groups from arbit-",
  "rary state action. The rights defined included freedom and equality before the",
  "law, the cultural rights of minorities, and the prohibition of such practices as",
  "untouchability and forced labour.18 The directive principles, which were not",
  "justiciable, derived from the positive obligations of the state to provide for",
  "amore fulfilling life forthecitizen. Theywere acurious amalgam ofcontend-",
  "ing pulls. Some principles were a concession to the socialist wing of the Con-gress, others (such as the ban on cow-slaughter) to the party\u2019s conservative",
  "faction.19",
  "To the unprejudiced eye the constitution was an adaptation of Western",
  "principles to Indian ends. Some patriotsdid not see it that way. They claimed",
  "that it was Indians who had invented adult suffrage. T. Prakasam spoke about",
  "an inscription on a 1,000-year-old Conjeevaram temple which talked of an",
  "electionheldwithleavesasballotpapersandpotsasballotboxes.20Thiskind",
  "of chauvinism was not the preserve of the south alone. The Hindi scholar",
  "Raghu Vira claimed that ancient India was \u2018the originator of the Republic-",
  "an system of government\u2019, and \u2018spread this system to the otherparts of the",
  "world\u2019.21",
  "Those who had looked closely at the provisions of the constitution could",
  "notthusconsolethemselves.MahavirTyagiwas\u2018verymuchdisappointed[to]",
  "see nothing Gandhian in this Constitution\u2019.22 And K. Hanumanthaiya com-",
  "plained that while freedom fighters like himself had wanted \u2018the music of",
  "Veena or Sitar\u2019, what they had got instead was \u2018the music of an English",
  "band\u201923",
  "V",
  "The Constitution of India sought both to promote national unity and to facil-",
  "itate progressive social change. There was a fundamental right to propagate",
  "religion, butthestate reserved toitself therighttoimpose legislation oriented",
  "towards social reform (such as a uniform civil code). The centre had the",
  "powers, through national planning, to redistribute resources away from richer",

  "Fundamentalrightswerequalifiedandlimitedbyneedsofsocialreform,",
  "andalsobyconsiderationsofsecurityandpublicorder.Therewereprovisions",
  "for rights to be suspended in times of \u2018national emergency\u2019. And there was",
  "a clause allowing for \u2018preventive detention\u2019 without trial. A veteran freedom",
  "fighter called this \u2018the darkest blot on this constitution\u2019. Having spent ten",
  "years of his own life in \u2018dungeons and condemned cells in the days of ourslavery under the British\u2019, he knew \u2018the tortures which detention without trial",
  "means and I can never reconcile myself to it\u201924",

  "India over those of its constituent states. There was already a unitary system",
  "inplace,imposedbythecolonialpower.Theviolenceofthetimesgaveafur-",
  "ther push to centralization, now seen as necessary both to forestall chaos and",
  "to plan for the country\u2019s economic development.",
  "The constitution provided for three areas of responsibility: union, state",
  "and concurrent. The subjects in the first list were the preserve of the central",
  "government while those in the second list were vested with the states. As for",
  "thethirdlist,herecentreandstatesharedresponsibility.However,manymore",
  "items were placed under exclusive central control than in other federations,",
  "and more placed on the concurrent list too than desired by the provinces. The",
  "centre also had control of minerals and key industries. And Article 356 gave",
  "it the powerto takeovera state administration on the recommendation of the",
  "governor.25",
  "Provincial politicians fought hard for the rights of states, for fewer items",
  "to be put on the concurrent and union lists. They asked for a greater share of",
  "tax revenues and they mounted an ideological attack on the principle itself. A",
  "member from Orissa said that the constitution had \u2018so centralised power, that",
  "I am afraid, due to its very weight, the Centre is likely to break\u2019. A member",
  "fromMysorethoughtthatwhatwasproposedwasa\u2018unitary\u2019ratherthan\u2018fed-",
  "eral\u2019 constitution. Under its provisions \u2018democracy is centred in Delhi and it",
  "isnotallowedtoworkinthesamesenseandspiritintherestofthecountry\u2019.26",
  "Perhaps the most eloquent defence of states\u2019 rights came from K.",
  "Santhanam of Madras. He thought that the fiscal provisions would make",
  "provinces \u2018beggars at the door of the Centre\u2019. In the UnitedStates, both centre",
  "and state could levy \u2018all kinds of tax\u2019, but here, crucial sources of revenue,",
  "such as the income tax, had been denied the provinces. Besides, the Draft-",
  "ingCommittee hadtried\u2018toburdentheCentrewithallkindsofpowerswhich",
  "it ought not to have .These included \u2018vagrancy\u2019, which had been taken away",
  "fromthestates list andputontheconcurrent list. \u2018Doyouwant all Indiatobe",
  "bothered about vagrants?\u2019 asked Santhanam sarcastically. As he put it, rather",
  "than place an excessive load on the Union government, \u2018the initial respons-",
  "ibility for the well-being of the people of the provinces should rest with theP",
  "rovincial Governments\u2019.27",
  "The next day a member from the United Provinces answered these",
  "charges. Hearing Santhanam, he wondered whether it was not \u2018India\u2019s age-",
  "old historical tendency of disintegrating that was speaking through these stal-warts\u2019. A strong centre was an absolute imperative in these \u2018times of stress",
  "and strain . Only a strong centre would \u2018be in a position to think and plan for",
  "the well-being of the country as a whole\u2019.28",
  "Members of the Drafting Committee vigorously defended the unitary bi-",
  "as of the constitution. In an early session B. R. Ambedkar told the House that",
  "he wanted \u2018a strong united centre (hear, hear) much stronger than the centre",
  "we had created under the Government of India Act of 1935\u2019.29 And K. M.",
  "Munshi argued for the construction of \u2018a federation with a centre as strong",
  "as we can make it\u2019.30 In some matters Munshi was close to being a Hindu",
  "chauvinist; but here he found himself on the same side as the Muslims. For",
  "the horrific communal violence of 1946 and 1947 bore witness to the need",
  "for a strong centre. In the words of Kazi Syed Karimuddin, \u2018everybody is not",
  "PanditJawaharlalNehru\u2019(inrespectofhiscommitmenttointer-religioushar-",
  "mony).Therewere\u2018weakandvacillatingexecutivesinalltheProvinces\u2019,said",
  "the kazi. Thus \u2018what we want today is astable Government. What we want",
  "today is a patriotic Government. What we want today is a strong Govern-",
  "ment,animpartialandunbendingexecutive,thatdoesnotbowbeforepopular",
  "whims.\u201931",
  "VI",
  "Much attention was paid by the Assembly to the rights of the minorities. The",
  "first extended discussion of the subject took place a bare ten days after Par-",
  "tition. Here, a Muslim from Madras made a vigorous plea for the retention",
  "of separate electorates. \u2018As matters stand at present in this country\u2019, said B.",
  "Pocker Bahadur, it was \u2018very difficult\u2019 for non-Muslims \u2018to realise the needs",
  "and requirements of the Muslim community\u2019. If separate electorates were ab-",
  "olished,thenimportantgroupswouldbeleftfeeling\u2018thattheyhavenotgotan",
  "adequate voice in the governance of the country\u2019.32",
  "The home minister, Sardar Patel, was deeply unsympathetic to this de-",
  "mand. Separate electorates had in the past led to the division of the country.",
  "\u2018Those who want that kind of thing have a place in Pakistan, not here,\u2019",
  "thundered Patel to a burst of applause. \u2018Here, we are building a nation and",
  "we are laying the foundations of One Nation, and those who choose to divide",
  "againandsowtheseedsofdisruptionwillhavenoplace,noquarter,here,and",
  "I must say that plainly enough.\u201933There were, however, some Muslims who fromthestart were opposedto",
  "separate electorates. These included Begum Aizaz Rasul. It was \u2018absolutely",
  "meaningless\u2019nowtohavereservationonthebasisofreligion,saidthebegum.",
  "Separate electorates were \u2018a self-destructive weapon which separates the",
  "minorities from the majority for all time\u2019. For the interests of the Muslims in",
  "a secular democracy were \u2018absolutely identical\u2019 with those of other citizens.34",
  "By 1949 Muslim members who had at first demanded separate elector-",
  "atescameroundtothebegum\u2019spointofview.Theysensedthatreservationfor",
  "Muslims \u2018would be really harmful to the Muslims themselves\u2019. Instead, the",
  "Muslims should reconstitute themselves as voting blocs, so that in constitu-",

  "They could even come to \u2018have A decisive voice in the elections\u2019; for \u2018it may",

  "singlevote\u2019.Therefore,\u2018thesafetyoftheMuslimsliesinintelligently playing",
  "their part and mixing themselves with the Hindus in public affairs\u2019.35",
  "A vulnerable minority even more numerous than the Muslims were the",
  "women of India. The female members of the Assembly had come through",
  "the national movement and were infected early with the spirit of unity. Thus",
  "Hansa Mehta of Bombay rejected reserved seats, quotas or separate elect-",
  "orates. \u2018We have never asked for privileges\u2019, she remarked. \u2018What we have",
  "asked for is social justice, economic justice, and political justice. We have",
  "asked for that equality which alone can be the basis of mutual respect and un-",
  "derstanding and without which real co-operation is not possible between man",
  "and woman.\u201936 Renuka Roy of Bengal agreed: unlike the \u2018narrow suffragist",
  "movement[s]\u2019 of \u2018many so-called enlightened nations\u2019, the women of India",
  "strove for \u2018equality of status, for justice and for fair play and most of all to be",
  "able to take their part in responsible work in the service of their country\u2019. For",
  "\u2018ever since the start of the Women\u2019s Movement in this country, women have",
  "been fundamentally opposed to special privileges and reservations\u2019.37",
  "Theonlyvoiceinfavourofreservationforwomenwasaman\u2019s.Thiswas",
  "strange;strangerstillwasthelogicofhisargument.Fromhisown\u2018experience",
  "as a parliamentarian and a man of the world\u2019,)said R. K. Chaudhuri,",
  "I think it would be wise to provide for a women\u2019s constituency. When a",
  "woman asks for something, as we know, it is easy to get it and give it",
  "to her; but when she does not ask for anything in particular it becomes",
  "very difficult to find out what she wants. If you give them a special con-",
  "stituency they can have their scramble and fight there among themselveswithoutcomingintothegeneralconstituency.Otherwisewemayattimes",
  "feel weak and yield in their favour and give them seats which they are",
  "not entitled to.38",
  "VII",
  "There would be no reservation for Muslims and women. But the constitution",
  "did recommend reservation for Untouchables. This was in acknowledgement",

  "made popular a newterm for \u2018Untouchables\u2019, which was \u2018Harijans\u2019, or chil-",
  "dren of God.",
  "The constitution set aside seats in legislatures as well as jobs in gov-",
  "ernment offices for the lowest castes. It also threw open Hindu temples to",
  "all castes, and asked for the abolition of untouchability in society at large.",
  "These provisions were very widely welcomed. Munis-wamyPillai of Madras",

  "ability...[G]reatsaintstriedtheirlevelbesttoabolishuntouchabilitybutitis",
  "given to this august Assembly and the new Constitution to say in loud terms",
  "that no more untouchability shall stay in our country. 39",
  "As H. J. Khandekar of the Central Provinces pointed out, Untouchables",
  "were conspicuously under-represented in the upper echelons of the adminis-",
  "tration. In the provinces, where they might constitute up to 25 per cent of the",
  "population,therewasoftenonlyoneHarijanminister,whereasBrahminswho",
  "made up only 2 per cent of the population might command two-thirds of the",
  "seatsintheCabinet.Khandekarsuggestedthatdespitethepubliccommitment",
  "ofthe Congress, \u2018except forMahatma Gandhi and ten ortwenty other [upper-",
  "caste] persons there is none to think of the uplift of the Harijans in the true",
  "sense\u2019.",
  "This member eloquently defended the extension of reservation to jobs in",
  "government. He alluded to the recent recruitment to the Indian Administrat-",
  "ive Service, the successor to the ICS. Many Harijans were interviewed but all",
  "werefoundunsuitableonthegroundsthattheirgradeswerenotgoodenough.",
  "Addressing his upper-caste colleagues, Khandekar insisted thatYou are responsible for our being unfit today. We were suppressed for",
  "thousands of years. You engaged in your service to serve your own ends",
  "and suppressed us to such an extent that neither our minds nor our bod-",
  "iesandnorevenourheartswork,norareweabletomarchforward.This",
  "is the position. You have reduced us to such a position and then you say",
  "thatwearenotfitandthatwehavenotsecuredtherequisitemarks.How",
  "can we secure them?40",
  "The argument was hard, if not impossible, to refute. But some members",
  "warned against the possible abuse of the provisions. One thought that \u2018those",
  "personswhoareclamouringfortheseseats,forreservation,forconsideration,",
  "represent a handful of persons, constituting the cream of Harijan society\u2019.",
  "These were the \u2018politically powerful among these groups.41 For the left-wing",
  "congress politician Mahavir Tyagi, reservation did not lead to real represent-",
  "ation. For \u2018no caste ever gets any benefit from this reservation. It is the in-",
  "dividual or family which gets benefits\u2019. Instead of caste, perhaps there might",
  "be reservation by class, such that \u2018cobblers, fishermen and other such classes",
  "send their representatives through reservation because they are the ones who",
  "do not really get any representation\u201942",
  "VIII",
  "Thefirstreportonminorityrights,madepublicinlateAugust1947,provided",
  "for reservation for Untouchables only. Muslims were denied the right, which",
  "in the circumstances was to be expected. However, one member of the",
  "Assemblyregrettedthat\u2018themostneedy,themostdeservinggroupofadibasis",
  "[tribals] has been completely left out of the picture\u2019.43",
  "The member was Jaipal Singh, himself an adivasi, albeit of a rather spe-",

  "Bihar peopled by numerous tribes all more-or-less distinct from caste Hindu",
  "society. Sent by missionaries to study in Oxford, he made a name there as a",
  "superb hockey player. He obtained a Blue, and went on to captain the Indian",
  "team that won the gold medal in the 1928 Olympic Games.",
  "On his return to India Jaipal did not, as hissponsors no doubt hoped,",
  "preach theGospel, but came to invent a kind of gospel of hisown. This held",
  "that the tribals were the \u2018original inhabitants\u2019 of the subcontinent \u2013 hence the",
  "term \u2018adibasi\u2019 or \u2018adivasi\u2019, which means precisely that. Jaipal formed an Adi-basiMahasabhain1938whichaskedforaseparatestateof\u2018Jharkhand\u2019,tobe",

  "Jaipal was a gifted speaker, whose interventions both enlivened and en-",
  "tertained the House. (In this respect, the Church\u2019s loss was unquestionably",
  "politics\u2019gain.)Hisfirstspeechwasmadeon19December1946when,inwel-",
  "coming the Objectives Resolution, he provided a masterly summation of the",
  "adivasi case. \u2018As ajungli, as an adibasi\u2019, said Jaipal,",
  "I am not expected to understand the legal intricacies of the Resolution.",

  "road to freedom and fight together. Sir, if there is any group of Indian",

  "cerned \u2013 it is the newcomers who have driven away my people from the",
  "Indus Valley to the jungle fastness . . . The whole history of my people",
  "is one of continuous exploitation and dispossession by the non-aborigin-",
  "als of India punctuated by rebellions and disorder, and yet I take Pan-",
  "dit Jawahar Lal Nehru at his word. I take you all at your word that now",
  "we are going to start a new chapter, a new chapter of independent India",
  "where there is equality of opportunity, where no one would be neglec-",
  "ted.45",
  "Three years later, in the discussion on the draft constitution, Jaipal made as",
  "peech that was spirited in all senses of the word. Bowing to pressure by",
  "Gandhians, the prohibition of alcohol had been made a directive principle.",
  "This, said the adivasi leader, was an interference \u2018with the religious rights of",
  "themostancientpeopleinthecountry\u2019.Foralcoholwaspartoftheirfestivals,",

  "10 of December 1946, while the procedures of the House were still being dis-",

  "who are present in this House to fashion a constitution for India and do",
  "not know Hindustani are not worthy to be members of this Assembly.",
  "They had better leave.",
  "The remarks created acommotion in the House. \u2018Order, order!\u2019 yelled the",
  "chairman, butDhulekar continued:",
  "I move that the Procedure Committee should frame rules in Hindustani",
  "and not in English. As an Indian I appeal that we, who are out to win",
  "freedom for our country and are fighting for it, should think and speak",
  "in our own language. We have all along been talking of America, Japan,Germany, Switzerland and House of Commons. It has given me a head-",
  "ache. I wonder why Indians do not speak in their own language. As an",
  "Indian I feel that the proceedings of the House should be conducted in",
  "Hindustani.Wearenotconcernedwiththehistoryoftheworld.Wehave",
  "the history of our own country of millions of past years.",
  "The printed proceedings continue:",
  "The Chairman: Order, order!",
  "Shri R. V. Dhulekar (speaking still in Hindustani): I request you to allow",
  "me to move my amendment.",
  "The Chairman: Order, order! I do not permit you to proceed further. The",
  "House is with me that you are out of order.48",
  "AtthispointJawaharlalNehruwentuptotherostrumandpersuadedDhulekar",
  "to return to his seat. Afterwards Nehru told the errant member of the need to",
  "maintain discipline in the House. He told him that \u2018this is not a public meet-",
  "inginJhansithatyoushouldaddress\u201cBhaioaurBehno\u201d[brothersandsisters]",
  "and start lecturing at the top of your voice .49",
  "But the issue would not go away. In one session members urged the",
  "House to order the Delhi government to rule that all car number plates should",
  "be in Hindi script.50 More substantively, they demanded that the official ver-",
  "sionoftheConstitutionbeinHindi,withanunofficialversioninEnglish.This",
  "theDraftingCommitteedidnotaccept,onthegroundsthatEnglishwasbetter",
  "placed to incorporate the technical and legal terms of the document. When a",
  "draft constitution was placed before the House for discussion, members nev-",
  "ertheless asked for a discussion of each clause written in Hindi. To adopt a",
  "document written in English, they said, would be \u2018insulting\u2019.51",
  "It is necessary, at this point, to introduce a distinction between \u2018Hin-",
  "dustani\u2019 and \u2018Hindi\u2019. Hindi, written in the Devanagari script,drew heavily on",
  "Sanskrit.Urdu,writteninamodifiedArabicscript,drewonPersianandArab-",

  "in northern India, the two languages began to move further and further apart.",
  "OntheonesidetherearoseamovementtorootHindimorefirmlyinSanskrit;",
  "on the other, to root Urdu more firmly in the classical languages from whichit drew. Especially in the literary world, a purified Hindi and a purified Urdu",
  "began to circulate.52",
  "Throughallthis,thelanguageofpopularexchangeremainedHindustani.",
  "This was intelligible to Hindi and Urdus peakers, but also to the speakers",
  "of most of the major dialects of the Indo-Gangetic plain: Awadhi, Bhojpuri,",
  "Maithili,Marwariandsoon.However,Hindustani,aswellasHindiandUrdu,",
  "were virtually unknown in eastern and southern India. The languages spoken",
  "herewereAssamese,Bengali,Kannada,Malayalam,Oriya,TamilandTelugu,",
  "each with a script and sophisticated literary tradition of its own.",
  "Under British rule, English had emerged as the language of higher edu-",
  "cation and administration. Would it remain in this position after the British",
  "left? The politicians of the north thought that it should be Replaced by Hindi.",
  "The politicians and people of the south preferred that English continue as the",
  "vehicle of inter-provincial communication.",
  "Jawaharlal Nehru himself was exercised early by the question. In a long",
  "essay written in 1937 he expressed his admiration for the major provincial",
  "languages. Without \u2018infringing in the least on their domain\u2019 there must, he",
  "thought, still be an all-India language of communication. English was too",
  "far removed from the masses, so he opted instead for Hindustani, which he",
  "defined as a \u2018golden mean\u2019 between Hindi and Urdu. At this time, with Parti-",
  "tionnotevenapossibility,Nehruthoughtthatbothscriptscouldbeused.Hin-",
  "dustani had a simple grammar and was relatively easy to learn, but to make it",
  "easierstill,linguistscouldevolveaBasicHindustaniafterthefashionofBasic",
  "English, to be promoted by the state in southern India.53",
  "Like Nehru, Gandhi thought that Hindustani could unite north with",
  "south, and Hindu with Muslim. It, rather than English, should be made the",
  "rashtrabhasha, or national language. As he put it, \u2018Urdu diction is used by",
  "Muslims in writing. Hindi diction is used by Sanskrit pundits. Hindustani is",
  "the sweetmingling of the two.\u201954 In 1945 he engaged in a lively exchange",
  "with Purushottamdas Tandon, a man who fought hard, not to say heroically,",
  "to rid Hindi of its foreign elements. Tandon was vice-president of the All-In-",
  "diaHindiLiteratureConference,whicharguedthatHindiwiththeDevanagari",
  "script alone should be the national language. Gandhi, who had long been a",
  "member of the Conference,was dismayed by its chauvinist drift. Since he be-",
  "lieved that both the Nagari and Urdus scripts should be used, perhaps it was",
  "time to resign his membership. Tandon tried to dissuade him, but, as Gandhi",
  "put it, \u2018How can I ride two horses? Who will understand me when I say that",
  "rashtrabhasha = Hindi and rashtrabhasha = Hindi + Urdu = Hindustani?\u201955PartitionmoreorlesskilledthecaseforHindustani.Themovetofurther",

  "Assembly, where early references were to Hindustani, but later references all",

  "more fanatical. As Granville Austin observes, \u2018The Hindi-wallahs were ready",

  "used immediately before such commencement\u2019.59 Till 1965, at any rate, the",

  "cracy would be conducted in English.",
  "XMahatmaGandhihadonceexpressedhisdesiretoseeanUntouchablewoman",
  "installed as the first president of India. That did not happen, but some com-",
  "pensation was at hand when an Untouchable man, Dr B. R. Ambedkar, was",
  "asked to serve as the chairman of the Drafting Committee of the Constituent",
  "Assembly.",
  "On 25 November 1949, the day before the Assembly wound up its pro-",
  "ceedings, Ambedkar made a moving speech summing up their work.60 He",
  "thankedhisfellowmembersoftheDraftingCommittee,thankedtheirsupport",
  "staff, and thanked a party of which he had been a lifelong opponent. Without",
  "the quietwork in and out of the House by the Congress bosses, he would not",
  "have been able to render order out of chaos. \u2018It is because of the discipline of",
  "the Congress Party that the Drafting Committee was able to pilot the Consti-",
  "tution in the Assembly with the sure knowledge as to the fate of each article",
  "and each amendment.\u2019",
  "In a concession to patriotic nostalgia, Ambedkar then allowed that some",
  "form of democracy was not unknown in ancient India. \u2018There was a time",
  "when India was studded with republics\u2019. Characteristically he invoked the",
  "Buddhists, who had furthered the democratic ideal in their Bhikshu Sanghas,",
  "which applied rules akin to those of Parliamentary Procedure \u2013 votes, mo-",
  "tions, resolutions, censures and whips.",
  "Ambedkar also assured the House that the federalism of the constitution",
  "in no way denied states\u2019 rights. It was mistaken, he said, to think that there",
  "was \u2018too much centralization and that the States have been reduced to Muni-",
  "cipalities\u2019. The constitution had partitioned legislative and executive author-",
  "ity, but the Centre could not on its own alter the boundary of this partition. In",
  "his words, \u2018the Centre and the States are co-equal in this matter .",
  "Ambedkar ended his speech with three warnings about the future. The",
  "first concerned the place of popular protest in a democracy. There was no",
  "place for bloody revolution, of course, but in his view there was no room for",
  "Gandhian methods either. \u2018We must abandon the method of civil disobedien-",
  "ce, non-cooperation and satyagraha [popular protest]\u2019. Under an autocratic",
  "regime, there might be some justification for them, but not now, when con-",
  "stitutional methods of redress were available. Satyagraha and the like, said",
  "Ambedkar,were\u2018nothingbutthegrammarofanarchyandthesoonertheyare",
  "abandoned, the better for us\u2019",
  "Thesecondwarningconcernedtheunthinkingsubmissiontocharismatic",
  "authority. Ambedkar quoted John Stuart Mill, who cautioned citizens not \u2018to",
  "lay their liberties at the feet of even a greatman, or to trust him with powerswhich enable him to subvert their institutions\u2019. This warning was even more",
  "pertinent here than in England, for",
  "in India, Bhakti or what may be called the path of devotion or hero-wor-",
  "ship, plays apart in its politics unequalled in magnitude by the part it",
  "plays in the politics of any other country in the world. Bhakti in religion",
  "maybetheroadtothesalvationofasoul.Butinpolitics,Bhaktiorhero-",
  "worship is a sure road to degradation and to eventual dictatorship.",
  "Ambedkar\u2019s final warning was to urge Indians not to be content with what he",
  "called \u2018mere political democracy\u2019. India had got rid of alien rule, but it was",
  "still riven by inequality and hierarchy. Thus, once the country formally be-",
  "came a republic on 26 January 1950, it was",
  "going to enter a life of contradictions. In politics we will have equality",
  "and in social and economic life we will have inequality. In politics we",
  "will be recognizing the principle of one man one vote and one vote one",
  "value. In our social and economic life, we shall, by reason of our social",
  "and economic structure, continue to deny the principle of one man one",
  "value.Howlongshallwecontinuetolivethislifeofcontradictions?How",
  "long shall we continue to deny equality in our social and economic life?",
  "Ifwecontinuetodenyitforlong,wewilldosoonlybyputtingourpolit-",
  "ical democracy in peril.",
  "XI",
  "Eight months before the Constituent Assembly of India was convened a new",
  "constitution had been presented for approval to the Japanese Parliament, the",
  "Diet. However, this document had been almost wholly written by a group of",
  "foreigners. In early February 1946 twenty-four individuals \u2013 all Americans,",
