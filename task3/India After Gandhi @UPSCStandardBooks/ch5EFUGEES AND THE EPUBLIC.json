  "I I Kurukshetra occupies a special place. It was the venue",
  "NTHE NDIANIMAGINATION",
  "for the bloody battles described in the epic Mahabharata. According to the",
  "epic, the fighting took place on an open plain northwest of the ancient city of",
  "Indraprastha (now known as Delhi). The plain was called Kurukshetra, a name",
  "it retains to this day.",
  "Several thousand years after the Mahabharata was composed, the place of",
  "its enactment became the temporary home of the victims of another war.This,",
  "too, was fought between closely related kin: India and Pakistan, rather than",
  "PandavaandKaurava.ManyoftheHindusandSikhsfleeingWestPunjabwere",
  "directed by the government of India to a refugee camp in Kurukshetra. A vast",
  "city of tents had grown up on the plain, to house waves of migrants, some-",
  "timesupto20,000aday.Thecampwasinitiallyplannedfor100,000refugees,",
  "but it came to accommodate three times that number. As an American observ-",
  "er wrote, \u2018the army worked miracles to keep the tents rising ahead of the last",
  "refugees\u2019. The new inhabitants of Kurukshetra consumed 100 tons of flourdaily, along with large quantities of salt, rice, lentils, sugar and cooking oil \u2013",
  "allprovidedfreeofchargebythegovernment.Helpingthestateintheireffort",
  "was a network of Indian and foreign social workers, the United Council for",
  "Relief and Welfare (UCRW).",
  "The refugees had to be housed and fed, but also clothed and entertained.",
  "With winter approaching, the \u2018Government soonrecognized that the evenings",
  "and nights were hardest to bear\u2019. So the UCRW commandeered a bunch",
  "of film projectors from Delhi, and set them up in Kurukshetra. Among the",
  "movies shown were Disney specials featuring Mickey Mouse and Donald",
  "Duck. With large cloth screens allowing for two-way projection, crowds of",
  "up to 15,000 could watch a single show. This \u2018two-hour break from reality\u2019,",
  "commented asocial worker, \u2018was a lifesaver. The refugees forgot their shock",
  "experiences and misery for two golden hours of laughter. Yes, they who had",
  "beenbruisedandbeaten,werehomelessandwounded,couldlaugh.Herewas",
  "hope.\u20191",
  "Kurukshetra was the largest of the nearly 200 camps set up to house",
  "refugees from West Punjab. Some refugees had arrived before the date of",
  "transfer of power; among them prescient businessmen who had sold their",
  "properties in advance and migrated with the proceeds. However, the vast ma-",
  "joritycameafter15August1947,andwithlittlemorethantheclothesontheir",
  "skin. These were the farmers who had \u2018stayed behind till the last moment,",
  "firmly resolved to remain in Pakistan if they could be assured of an honour-",
  "able living\u2019. But when, in September and October, the violence escalated in",
  "the Punjab, they had to abandon that idea. The Hindus and Sikhs who were",
  "lucky enough to escape the mobs fled to India by road, rail, sea and on foot.2",
  "Camps such as Kurukshetra were but a holding operation. The refugees",
  "had to be found permanent homes and productive work. A journalist visiting",
  "Kurukshetra in December 1947 described it as a city in itself, with 300,000",
  "people, all \u2018sitting idle like mad\u2019. \u2018The one thought that dominates the",
  "peasant-refugees of Kurukshetra\u2019, he wrote,is \u2018\u201cGive us some land. We will",
  "cultivate it\u201d. That is what they shouted. These land-hungry peasants told us",
  "that they did not very much care where land was given to them provided [it]",
  "was cultivable. Their passion for land appeared to be elemental.3",
  "As it happened, a massive migration had also taken place the other way,",
  "into Pakistan from India. Thus, the first place to resettle the refugees was",
  "on land vacated by Muslims in the eastern part of the Punjab. If the transfer",
  "of populations had been \u2018the greatest mass migration\u2019 in history, now com-",
  "menced \u2018the biggest land resettlement operation in the world\u2019. As against 2.7",
  "million hectares abandoned by Hindus and Sikhs in West Punjab, there wereonly1.9millionhectaresleftbehindbyMuslimsinEastPunjab.Theshortfall",
  "wasmademoreacutebythefactthattheareasinthewestoftheprovincehad",
  "richersoils,andweremoreabundantlyirrigated.Indeed,backinthelatenine-",
  "teenthcentury,hundredsofSikhvillageshadmigratedenmassetothewestto",
  "cultivate land in the newly created \u2018canal colonies\u2019. There they had made the",
  "desert flourish, but one fine day in 1947 they were told that their garden now",
  "lay in Pakistan. So, in a bare two generations, these dispossessed Sikhs found",
  "themselves back in their original homes.",
  "To begin with, each family of refugee farmers was given an allotment of",
  "four hectares, regardless of its holding in Pakistan. Loans were advanced to",
  "buy seed and equipment. While cultivation commenced on these temporary",
  "plots, applications were invited for permanent allotments. Each family was",
  "asked to submit evidence of how much land it had left behind. Applications",
  "were received from 10 March 1948; within a month, more than half a million",
  "claims had been filed. These claims were then verified in open assemblies",
  "consisting of other migrants from the same village. As each claim was read",
  "out by a government official, the assembly approved, amended, or rejected it.",
  "Expectedly,manyrefugeeswereatfirstpronetoexaggeration.However,",
  "everyfalseclaimwaspunished,sometimesbyareductioninthelandallotted,",
  "in extreme cases by a brief spell of imprisonment. This acted as a deterrent;",
  "still,anofficercloselyassociated withtheprocessestimated thattherewasan",
  "overall inflation of about 25 per cent. To collect, collate, verify and act upon",
  "the claims a Rehabilitation Secretariat was set up in Jullundur. At its peak",
  "there were about 7,000 officials working here; they came to constitute a kind",
  "of refugee city of their own. The bulk of these officials were accommodated",
  "in tents, the camp serviced by makeshift lights and latrines and with tempor-",
  "ary shrines, temples for Hindus and gurdwaras for Sikhs.",
  "Leading the operations was the director general of rehabilitation, Sardar",
  "Tarlok Singh of the Indian Civil Service. A graduate of the London School of",
  "Economics, Tarlok Singh used his academic training to good effect, making",
  "two innovations that proved critical in the successful settlement of the",
  "refugees. These were the ideas of the \u2018standard acre\u2019 and the \u2018graded cut\u2019. A",
  "\u2018standard acre\u2019 was defined as that amount of land which could yield ten to",
  "eleven maunds of rice. (A maund is about 40 kilograms.) In the dry, unirrig-",
  "ated districts of the east, four physical acres comprised one \u2018standard\u2019 acre,",
  "whereasinthelushcanalcolonies,arealacreoflandmoreorlessequalledits",
  "standard counterpart.",
  "The concept of the standard acre innovatively took care of the variations",
  "in soil and climate across the province.Theidea of the \u2018graded cut\u2019, mean-while,helpedovercomethemassivediscrepancybetweenthelandleftbehind",
  "by the refugees and the land now available to them \u2013 a gap that was close to",
  "a million acres. For the first ten acres of any claim, a cut of 25 percent was",
  "implemented \u2013 thus one got only 7.5 acres instead of ten. For higher claims",
  "the cuts were steeper: 30 per cent for 10\u201330 acres, and on upwards, till those",
  "having in excess of 500 acres were \u2018taxed at the rate of 95 per cent. The",
  "biggestsingleloserwasaladynamedVidyawati,whohadinherited(andlost)",
  "her husband\u2019s estate of 11,500 acres, spread across thirty-five villages of the",
  "Gujranwala and Sialkot districts. In compensation, she was allotted a mere",
  "835 acres in a single village of Karnal.",
  "By November 1949 Tarlok Singh and his men had made 250,000 al-",
  "lotments of land. These refugees were then distributed equitably across the",
  "districts of East Punjab. Neighbours and families were resettled together,",
  "although the re-creation of entire village communities proved impossible.",
  "Refugees were invited to protest against their allotments; close to 100,000",
  "families asked for a review. A third of these objections were acted upon; as a",
  "result, 80,000 hectares changed hands once again.",
  "Inexchangefortheirwell-wateredlandsinthewest,theserefugeeswere",
  "given impoverished holdings in the east. With the implementation of graded",
  "cuts, they had less of it as well. But with characteristic ingenuity and enter-",
  "prise they set to work, digging new wells, building new houses, planting their",
  "crops. By 1950 a depopulated countryside was alive once again.4",
  "Yet a sense of loss persisted. The economy could be rebuilt,but the cul-",
  "turalwrongsofPartitioncouldneverbeundone\u2013notin,orby,eitherside.The",
  "Sikhs once more had land to cultivate, but they would never get back much-",
  "loved places of worship. These included the gurdwara in Lahore where lay",
  "buried their great warrior-chieftain, Ranjit Singh, as well as Nankana Sahib,",
  "the birthplace of the founder of the faith, Guru Nanak.",
  "InApril1948theeditoroftheCalcuttaStatesmanvisitedNankanaSahib,",
  "where he met the handful of Sikhs permitted by Pakistan to stay on as guard-",
  "ians of the shrine. A few months later the journalist visited the centre of the",
  "Ahmadiya sect of Islam, the town of Qadian, which lay in the Indian Punjab.",
  "The great tower of the Ahmadiya mosque was visible from miles around, but",
  "with in its precincts there now lived only 300 of the faithful. Otherwise, the",
  "townhadbeentakenoverby12,000HinduandSikhrefugees.InbothQadian",
  "and Nankana Sahib there was \u2018the conspicuous dearth of daily worshippers,",
  "the aching emptiness, the sense of waiting, of hope and . . . of faith fortified",
  "by humbling affliction\u2019.5II",
  "Thebulkofthemigrants fromWestPunjabwerefarmers; butthere were",
  "also many who were artisans, traders and labourers. To accommodate them",
  "thegovernmentbuiltbrand-newtownships.One,Farida-bad,laytwentymiles",
  "south of the nation\u2019s capital, Delhi. Among the groups active here was the In-",
  "dian Cooperative Union (ICU), an organization headed by Kamaladevi Chat-",
  "topadhyaya,asocialistandfeministwhohadbeencloselyassociatedwithMa-",
  "hatma Gandhi.",
  "The residents of Faridabad were mostly Hindu refugees from the North-",
  "West Frontier Province. A social worker named Sudhir Ghosh encouraged",
  "themtoconstructtheirownhomes.However,thegovernmentwishedtobuild",
  "the houses through its Public Works Department (PWD), notorious for its",
  "sloth and corruption, widely known both as the \u2018Public Waste Department\u2019",
  "and as \u2018Plunder Without Danger\u2019. In protest a group of refugees besieged the",
  "prime minister\u2019s house in Delhi. They were a \u2018nuisance\u2019 to Nehru, who en-",
  "countered them as he went to work every morning, but at least they made",
  "him \u2018think furiously of the problems\u2019 facing the refugees. In atypically Indi-",
  "an compromise, the refugees were allowed to build about 40 per cent of the",
  "houses, with the PWD constructing the rest.",
  "In Faridabad, the ICU organized co-operatives and self-help groups, set-",
  "ting up shops and small production units. To power these, and to light up",
  "the homes, a diesel plant was erected at short notice. This plant lay in ashed",
  "in Calcutta, where it had come as part of German war reparations. No one",
  "wanted it in that city, so it was sent to Faridabad instead. Sudhir Ghosh loc-",
  "ated the German engineer whohad built the plant in Hamburg,and persuaded",
  "him to come to India. The engineer came, but to his dismay no cranes were",
  "available to erect it. So he trained the Faridabad men to operate 15-tonne jack",
  "screws, which helped raise the equipment inch-by-inch. In ten months the",
  "plant was ready. In April 1951 Nehru himself came to commission it, and as",
  "he \u2018pressed the button, the lights came on and lifted the spirits of all in Far-",
  "idabad. The township had power in its hands to fashion its industrial future.\u20196",
  "Meanwhile, thousands of refugees had made their homes in Delhi itself.",
  "Till 1911 that city had been Muslim in character and culture. In that year, the",
  "BritishshiftedtheircapitaltherefromCalcutta.After1947NewDelhibecame",
  "the seat of the government of free India. Urdu-speaking Muslims went away",

  "LikeDelhi,thecityofBombayalsohaditscultureandsocialgeographytrans-",

  "city, these arriving from Sindh, Punjab and the Frontier. The refugees fur-",

  "housing shortage. Almost a million people were now sleeping on the pave-",

  "There were five refugee camps in Bombay. Their condition left much to",
  "be desired. The Kolwada camp had 10,400 people living in barracks. The av-",

  "protesting their living conditions. Pratap Singh had them served with an evic-",

  "young man was killed. The journalist reporting the story appropriately called",
  "the residents of the camp \u2018inmates\u2019; as he noted, \u2018other inmates [were] huge",
  "cat-sized ugly rats, bugs, mosquitoes, and snakes\u2019.12",
  "The refugees from Sindh spread themselves across the towns and cities",
  "of western India. Apart from Bombay, there were substantial communities",
  "in Pune and Ahmedabad. A social psychologist visiting them in the autumn",
  "of 1950 found the Sindh is deeply dissatisfied. The \u2018complaints of crowded,",
  "filthy quarters, inadequate water, insufficient rations, and above all, insuf-",
  "ficient support from the government, are almost universal\u2019. A refugee in",
  "Ahmedabad said that \u2018we are eating stuff which we used to throw away in",
  "Pakistan for the birds to eat\u2019. Others complained of ill treatment by the local",
  "Gujaratis, and were particularly hostile towards the Muslims. And they ful-",
  "minated against the Indian state, although they exonerated Nehru himself.",
  "\u2018Our government is useless,\u2019 they said. \u2018All are thieves collected together.",
  "Only Pandit [Nehru] is all right; the rest are all worthless and self-serving.",
  "The Pandit himself says what he can do; the rest of the machinery does not",
  "work.\u201913",
  "IVThe influx of refugees also transformed the landscape of India\u2019s third great",
  "metropolis, Calcutta. Before Partition, the more prosperous Hindu families of",
  "eastern Bengal had begun moving with their assets to the city. After Partition",
  "the immigration was chiefly of working-class and farming families. Unlike",
  "in the Punjab, where the exodus happened in one big rush, in Bengal it was",
  "spread out. However, in the winter of 1949\u201350 there was a wave of commun-",
  "al riots in East Pakistan which forced many more Hindus across the border.",
  "In previous years about 400,000 refugees came into West Bengal; in 1950 the",
  "number jumped to 1.7 million.",
  "Where did these people seek refuge? Those who could, stayed with re-",
  "latives. Others made a home on the city\u2019s railway stations, where their beds,",
  "boxes and other accessories lay spread out on the platform. Here \u2018families",
  "lived,slept,mated,defecatedandateontheconcreteamidstflies,lice,infants",
  "and diarrhoea. Victims of cholera would lie exhausted staring at their vomit,",
  "women were kept busy delousing each other, beggars begged.\u2019 Still others",
  "lived on the street, \u2018with the stray cattle, like the stray cattle, drinking gutter-",
  "water, eating garbage, sleeping on the curb . . .\u201914",
  "So wrote the Manchester Guardian correspondent in India. In truth, the",
  "refugees were a good deal less passive than this description suggests.",
  "Early in 1948 a \u2018large number of refugees, disgusted with their miserable",
  "existence at Sealdah station, occupied the Lake military barracks, Jodhpur",
  "military barracks, the Mysore House and other large unoccupied houses and",
  "military barracks at Shahpur, Durgapur, Ballygunge Circular Road and",
  "Dharmatala. Almost overnight these deserted houses swarmed with refugee",
  "men, women and children. These were deliberate acts of trespass.\u201915",

  "migration in the other direction \u2013 as there had been in the Punjab \u2013 leaving",
  "untended fields and farms for the refugees to be settled in. For another, the",
  "government liked to believe \u2013 or hope \u2013 that this influx was temporary, and",
  "that when things settled down the Hindus would return to their homes in the",
  "east. Buttressing this belief was the claim that the Bengalis were somehow",
  "less \u2018communal-minded\u2019 than the Punjabis. Here, the Muslim spoke the samelanguage and ate the same food as his Hindu neighbour; thus he might more",
  "readily continue to live cheek-by-jowl with him.",
  "Thislatterargumentwasvigorouslyrejectedbytherefugeesthemselves.",
  "For them there was no going back to what they saw as an Islamic state.",
  "They found support for their views in the person of the historian Sir Jadunath",
  "Sarkar, arguably the most influential Bengali intellectual of his generation.",
  "Addressing a mammoth public meeting of refugees, held on 16 August 1948,",
  "Sir Jadunath compared the migration of East Bengal Hindus to the flight of",
  "French Huguenots in the time of Louis XIV. He urged the people of West",
  "Bengal to absorb and integrate the migrants, thus to nourish their culture and",
  "economy.Withthehelpoftherefugees,saidthehistorian,\u2018wemustmakeour",
  "West Bengal what Palestine under Jewish Rule will be, a light in darkness, an",

  "In September 1948 an All-Bengal Refugee Council of Action was",
  "formed. Marches and demonstrations were organized demanding that the",
  "refugees be given fair compensation and citizenship rights. The leaders of the",

  "mark of the city.\u201918",
  "Displaced from their homes by forces outside their control, refugees",
  "everywhere are potential fodder for extremist movements. In Delhi and the",
  "Punjab it was the radical Hindu organization, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak",
  "Sangh, that very early on got a foothold among the migrants. In Bengal the",
  "RSS\u2019s sister organization, the Hindu Mahasabha, also worked hard at giving",
  "a religious colour to the problem. The Bengali Hindus, they said, \u2018have been",
  "made sacrificial goats in the great Yajna of India\u2019s freedom\u2019. In asking them",
  "toreturntoEastPakistan,thegovernmentwasguiltyof\u2018appeasement\u2019andof",
  "abetting \u2018genocide\u2019 While the state asked them to submit, what the refugees",
  "needed was a stiff dose of \u2018the virility of man\u2019. \u2018One only wishes\u2019, wrote one",
  "angry Hindu in March 1950, that \u2018a Shivaji or a Rana Pratap emerged from",
  "their ranks\u2019.19",
  "This invocation of medieval Hindu warriors who had fought Muslim",
  "kings found more takers in Delhi and the Punjab. In Bengal, however, it was",
  "the communists who most successfully mobilized the refugees. It was they",
  "whoorganizedtheprocessionstogovernmentoffices,anditwastheywhoor-chestrated the forcible occupation of fallow land in Calcutta, land to which",

  "Committee\u2019 claimed to represent 40,000 families who, in their respective",
  "colonies, had constructed a total of 500 miles of road, sunk 700 tube wells",
  "and started 45 high schools as well as 100 primary schools \u2013 all at their",
  "own expense and through their own initiative. The Committee demanded that",
  "the government make these colonies \u2018legal by formally bringing them under",
  "the Calcutta Municipality, that it similarly regularize private plots and school",
  "buildings, and help develop markets and arrange loans.22",
  "Those who spoke for these migrants frequently complained about the",
  "preferential treatment given to the Punjabi refugees. A team of Bengali social",
  "workers visiting north India found the camps there \u2018of a superior kind\u2019. The",

  "tion, the organization had been active in the Punjab violence, and had much",

  "ism of youth, and upon its fanaticism too. In the early years of Indian inde-",
  "pendence, these two groups were the most motivated opponents of the ruling",
  "Congress Party.",
  "At the helm of the Congress was the Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru.",
  "Inconfrontingtheradicalsofleftandright,Nehrufacedtwomajorhandicaps.",
  "First, hewasamoderate, andthemiddle groundisgenerally notconducive to",
  "the kind of stirring rhetoric that compels men to act. Second, he and his col-",
  "leagues were far older than their political rivals. In 1949 Nehru himself was",
  "sixty, an age at which a Hindu male is supposed to retire from the workaday",
  "world and take sanyas.",
  "Nehru saw the RSS as the greater of the two threats. Others in his gov-",
  "ernment, notably Vallabhbhai Patel, disagreed. Intriguingly, M. S. Golwalkar",
  "had written to Patel offering help in battling the common enemy \u2013 the com-",

  "very soon.\u201944 This idea of a joint front appealed to Patel; indeed, it may have",
  "been one reason he contemplated absorbing the RSS within the Congress.",
  "In the event, members of the RSS were not admitted into the Congress.",
  "But Golwalkar remained at large, free to propagate his views to those who",
  "chose to hear them. In the first week of November 1949, the RSS chief ad-",
  "dressed a crowd of 100,000 in Bombay\u2019s Shivaji Park. A reporter in attend-",
  "ancedescribedhimas\u2018amanofmediumheightwithasunkenchest,longun-",
  "cut and unkempt hair and a flowing beard\u2019. He looked for all the world like a",
  "harmless Hindu ascetic, except that \u2018the black piercing eyes deep in the sock-",
  "etsgavethe[RSS]Chiefthetypicallookofablackmagicianabouttopullout",
  "a blood-curdling trick\u2019. Before he spoke, Golwalkar was presented with gar-",
  "lands by clubs specializing in body-building and the martial arts. The speech",
  "itself \u2018waxed hot on the virtues of Hindu culture. As the reporter put it: \u2018He",
  "had a cure-all for the ills of the nation: Make Golwalkar the F\u00fchrer of All In-",
  "dia\u201945",
  "AweeklaterJawaharlalNehrucametospeakinBombay.Thevenuewas",
  "the same as for Golwalkar: Shivaji Park, that oasis of green grass in the heart",
  "of the densely packed, middle-class, chiefly Marathi-speaking housing colon-ies of central Bombay. Nehru used the same microphone as Golwalkar, this",
  "supplied by the Motwane Chicago Telephone and Radio Company. But his",
  "message was emphatically different, for he spoke of the need to maintain so-",
  "cial peace within India as well as peace between warring nations abroad.",
  "Nehru\u2019s talk was delivered on his sixtieth birthday, 14 November 1949.",
  "He could not have wished for a better present: the abundant affection of his",
  "countrymen. The prime minister was due to arrive in Bombay at 4.30 p.m.",
  "An hour before his plane landed at Santa Cruz airport, \u2018people started clos-",
  "ing their shops and stopped working so that they might be able to see Pandit",
  "Nehru. They jammed the sidewalks and the streets long before the open ma-",
  "roon car carrying Panditji sped by. As he passed by a tumultuous waving and",
  "rejoicing was noticed.\u2019",
  "An hour later, after awash and a change, Nehru arrived at Shivaji Park.",
  "Here, \u2018a record crowd [had]stampeded the vast maid an grounds to hear him.",
  "More than six lakhs [600,000] assembled that memorable evening. There was",
  "one seething mass of humanity; men, women and children who had come . .",
  ". to hear him for they still had faith in his leadership and ability to show the",
  "way in these hard and trying times ahead of us.\u201946",
  "AhundredthousandpeoplehadcometohearGolwalkarespousetheidea",
  "of a Hindu theocratic state for India. But in this Maharashtrian stronghold,",
  "six times as many came to cheer the prime minister\u2019s defence of democracy",
  "against absolutism, and secularism against Hindu chauvinism. In this con-",
  "test between competing ideas of India, Jawaharlal Nehru was winning hands",
  "down; for the time being, at any rate.",
  "VII",
  "Like the integration of the princely states, the rehabilitation of refugees was a",
  "political problem unprecedented in nature and scope. The migrants into India",
  "from Pakistan, wrote one of their number, were \u2018like the fallen autumn leaves",
  "in the wind or bits of stray newspaper flying hither and thither in the blown",
  "dust\u2019. For \u2018those who have come away safe in limb and mind are without any",
  "bearings and without any roots\u2019.47",

  "suchasAustria andNorway,andasmany aslived inthe colossal continent ofAustralia. These people were resettled with time, cash, effort and, not least,",
  "idealism.",
  "There was indeed much heroism and grandeur in the building of a new",
  "India. There were also errors and mistakes, loose ends that remained untied.",
  "There was pain and suffering in the extinguishing of the princely order, and",
  "therewaspainandsufferingintheresettlementoftherefugees.Yetbothtasks",
  "were, in the end, accomplished.",
  "Notably, the actors in this complicated and tortuous process were all In-",
  "dian.This,atleastontheBritishside,wascompletelyunanticipated.Aformer",
  "governor of Bengal had written in 1947 of how",
  "The end of British political control in India will not mean the departure",
  "oftheBritish,asindividuals,fromIndia.Itwillnotbepossibleformany",
  "years ahead for India to do without a large number of British individuals",
  "in government service. They will remain under contract to the Govern-",
  "ment of India and to the governments of the Provinces and States in a",
  "wide range of administrative, legal, medical, police and professional and",
  "technical appointments. It will be many years before India will be able",
  "to fill, from amongst her own sons, all the many senior positions under",
  "the government that the administration of her 400 million people makes",
  "necessary.48",
  "In the event, that help was not asked for, nor was it needed. Admittedly, the",
  "rulers had left behind a set of functioning institutions: the civil service and",
  "thepolice,thejudiciaryandtherailways,amongothers.AtIndependence,the",
  "government of India invited British members of the ICS to stay on; with but",
  "the odd exception, they all left for home, along with their colleagues in the",
  "other services. Thus it came to be that the heroes remembered in these pages",
  "were all Indians \u2013 whether politicians like Nehru and Patel, bureaucrats like",
  "Tarlok Singh and V. P. Menon, or social workers like Kamaladevi Chattopad-",
  "hyaya and Mridula Sarabhai. So too were the countless others who were un-",
  "named then and continue to be unknown now: the officials who took in and",
  "acted upon applications for land allotment, the officials who built the house-",
  "sand ran the hospitals and schools, the officials who sat in courts and secret-",
  "ariats.AlsooverwhelminglyIndianwerethesocialworkerswhocajoled,con-",
  "soled and cared for the refugees.",
  "An American architect who worked in India in the early years of",
  "Independence has written with feeling of the calibre and idealism of thosearoundhim.\u2018ThenumberandkindsofpeopleI\u2019veseen\u2019,wroteAlbertMayer,",
  "\u2018their ability, outlook, energy, and devotion; the tingling atmosphere of plans",
  "and expectation and uncertainty; and yet the calm and self-possession \u2013 what",
  "it adds up to is being present at the birth of a nation.\u201949",
  "In the history of nation-building only the Soviet experiment bears com-",
  "parison with the Indian. There too, a sense of unity had to be forged between",
  "many diverse ethnic groups, religions, linguistic communities and social",
  "classes. The scale \u2013 geographic as well as demographic \u2013 was comparably",
  "massive. The raw material the state had to work with was equally unpropi-",
  "tious: a people divided by faith and riven by debt and disease.",
  "India after the Second World War was much like the Soviet sssUnion",
  "after the First. A nation was being built out of its fragments. In this case,",
  "however, the process was unaided by the extermination of class enemies or",
  "the creation of gulags.I ",
