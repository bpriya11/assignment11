  "The conversation began with the Dalai Lama telling Nehru about the",
  "Khampa rebellion. The fighting had been bitter, and heavy losses had been in-",
  "curred by both sides. Across Tibet there was deep resentment against the anti-",
  "religious propaganda of the communists. When the Chinese invited the Dalai",

  "dertaken by the Tibetans in keeping with their religion and traditions. The",
  "Chinese way would leave them \u2018a people without their souls\u2019. His own hope",

  "more concerned as the correspondents grew more elevated, and the stakes-",

  "AsStuartSchramwrites,bythetimeoftheBandungConferenceof1955",
  "Chou En-lai had made his mark as \u2018an urbane and skilful diplomat\u2019, appear-",
  "ing \u2018side by side with Nehru as one of the two principal representatives of",
  "the non-European world, divided by ideology, but united by the fact that they",
  "were Asian\u2019.5",
  "In1955ChouandNehrumighthavebeendividedonlybypoliticalideo-",
  "logy. By 1958 they were divided also by national interest. In December of",
  "that year the Indian prime minister wrote the first of a long series of letters",
  "to Chou. Nehru began by expressing admiration for China\u2019s economic pro-",
  "gress before turning, gingerly and gently, to the question of the border. When",
  "they met in 1956, recalled Nehru, the Chinese leader had indicated that he",
  "thought the McMahon Line was a legacy of British imperialism, but \u2018because",
  "of the friendly relations\u2019 between China and India, his government would,",
  "after consulting with the local Tibetan authorities, give it recognition. Chou",
  "had then confirmed Nehru\u2019s impression that \u2018there was no major boundary",
  "disputebetweenChinaandIndia\u2019.ButnowcamethismapinChinaPictorial,",
  "whose borderline \u2018went right across Indian territory\u2019.",
  "A month later Chou En-lai replied, stating that \u2018historically no treaty",
  "or agreement on the Sino-Indian boundary has ever been concluded\u2019. The",
  "McMahon Line was \u2018a product of the British policy of aggression against the",
  "Tibet Region of China\u2019. Juridically speaking, \u2018it cannot be considered legal\u2019.",
  "The Indians had protested about a road in an area which, in Chou\u2019s opinion,\u2018has always been under Chinese jurisdiction. \u2018All this shows that [contrary",
  "to Nehru\u2019s claim] border disputes do exist between China and India\u2019. That",
  "was the context in which the China Pictorial map should be viewed. Chou",
  "suggested that both sides temporarily maintain the status quo, pending a final",
  "\u2018friendly settlement\u2019 on the border question.",
  "On 22 March 1959 Nehru wrote back. He was \u2018somewhat surprised\u2019 to",
  "hear that the frontier between India and the \u2018Tibet Region of China\u2019 was not",
  "accepted by Peking, for it had the sanction of several specific agreements.",
  "These included those forged between Kashmir and Lhasa in 1842 and, in",
  "the east, the McMahon Line agreed upon in 1913-14. Besides, there were",
  "clear natural features, watersheds and mountain tops, that defined the bor-",
  "ders between the two countries. There might be gaps here and there, but, said",
  "Nehru, for \u2018much the larger part of our boundary with China, there is suffi-",
  "cientauthoritybasedongeography,traditionaswellastreatiesforthebound-",
  "ary as shown in our published maps\u2019. The letter ended with the hope that \u2018an",
  "early understanding in this matter will be reached\u2019.",
  "Before Chou En-lai could reply, the Dalai Lama fled to India. This",
  "greatly complicated matters, as the Chinese were deeply resentful of the pop-",
  "ular welcome given him by large sections of the Indian public. For this they",
  "blamed New Delhi. Had not the granting of an audience by Nehru himself",
  "given an unfortunate legitimacy to the Tibetan leader? Peking\u2019s position was",
  "that the Tibetan revolt, far from being a popular uprising, was the product of",
  "\u2018fugitive upper-class reactionaries\u2019 aided by the \u2018American imperialists\u2019 and",
  "the \u2018Chiang Kai-shek clique\u2019. Sections of the Chinese media went so far as to",
  "claim that the Indian town of Kalimpong was the \u2018commanding centre of the",
  "revolt\u2019, that the Delhi government was being influenced by \u2018imperialist pro-",
  "paganda and intrigues\u2019 and that \u2018Sino-Indian friendship was being destroyed",
  "from the Indian side\u2019.6",
  "There was some propaganda activity by Tibetan refugees in Kalimpong,",
  "the import of which was, however, greatly exaggerated by the Chinese. In",
  "fact,muchlouderprotestshademanatedfromIndiansources,inparticularthe",
  "politician turned social worker Jayaprakash Narayan. \u2018JP\u2019 was a fervent ad-",
  "vocate for Tibetan independence, a cause also supported by other, less dis-",
  "interested elements in Indian politics, such as the Jana Sangh, which wanted",
  "New Delhi openly to ally with the United States in the Cold War and seek",
  "its assistance in \u2018liberating\u2019 Tibet.7 But, as the foreign secretary assured the",
  "Chinese ambassador a month after the Dalai Lama\u2019s flight into exile, \u2018India",
  "hashadandhasnodesiretointerfereininternalhappeningsinTibet\u2019.Theex-",
  "iledleader\u2018willbeaccordedrespectfultreatmentinIndia,butheisnotexpec-ted to carry out any political activities from this country\u2019. This was the gov-",
  "ernment\u2019s position, from which some Indians would naturally dissent. For, as",
  "the foreign secretary pointed out, \u2018there is by law and Constitution complete",
  "freedom of expression of opinion in Parliament and the press and elsewhere",
  "in India. Opinions are often expressed in severe criticism of the Government",
  "of India\u2019s policies.\u2019",
  "This was not a nuance Peking could easily understand. For, at least in",
  "public, there could not be any criticism of the government\u2019s policies within",
  "China. The difference between these two political systems \u2013 call them \u2018total-",
  "itarianism\u2019 and \u2018democracy\u2019 \u2013 was most strikingly reflected in an exchange",
  "about an incident that took place in Bombay on 20 April. According to the",
  "Chinese version \u2013 communicated to New Delhi by Peking in a letter dated 27",
  "April \u2013 a group of protesters raised slogans and made speeches which",
  "branded China\u2019s putting down of the rebellion in her own territory, the",
  "Tibetan Region, as [an] imperialist action and made all sorts of slanders.",
  "What is more serious is that they pasted up a portrait of Mao Tse-tung,",
  "Chairman of the People\u2019s Republic of China, on the wall of the Chinese",
  "Consulate-General and carried out wanton insult by throwing tomatoes",
  "and rotten eggs at it. While these ruffians were insulting the portrait, the",
  "Indian policemen stood by without interfering with them, and pulled off",
  "the encircling spectators for the correspondents to take photographs . . .",
  "This incident in Bombay constituted, in Peking\u2019s view, \u2018a huge insult to the",
  "headofstateofthePeople\u2019sRepublicofChinaandtherespectedandbeloved",
  "leader of the Chinese people\u2019. It was an insult which \u2018the masses of the six",
  "hundred and fifty million Chinese people absolutely cannot tolerate\u2019. If the",
  "matterwas\u2018notreasonablysettled\u2019,saidthecomplaint,incase\u2018thereplyfrom",
  "the Indian Government is not satisfactory\u2019, the \u2018Chinese side will never come",
  "to a stop without a satisfactory settlement of the matter, that is to say, never",
  "stop even for one hundred years\u2019.",
  "In reply, the Indian government \u2018deeply regret[ted] that discourtesy was",
  "shown to a picture of Chairman Mao Tse-tung, the respected head of a state",
  "withwhichIndiahastiesoffriendship\u2019.Buttheydeniedthatthepolicemenon",

  "\u2018Timmy\u2019 was the closest the pacifist Indians had ever come to having an",
  "authentic modern military hero.9 However, he did not see eye to eye with his",
  "defence minister. Thimayya thought that his troops should be better prepared",
  "for a possible engagement with China, but Krishna Menon insisted that the",
  "realthreatcamefromPakistan,alongwhosebordersthebulkofIndia\u2019stroops",
  "were thus deployed. Thimayya was also concerned about the antiquity of the",
  "arms his men currently carried. These included the .303 Enfield rifle, which",
  "had first been used in the First World War. When the general suggested to the",
  "minister that India should manufacture the Belgian FN4 automatic rifle under",
  "licence, \u2018Krishna Menon said angrily that he was not going to have NATO",
  "arms in the country\u2019.10In the last week of August 1959 Thimayya and Menon fell out over the",
  "latter\u2019s decision to appoint to the rank of lieutenant general an officer named",
  "B. M. Kaul, in supersession of twelve officers senior to him. Kaul had a flair",

  "The matter was discussed in Parliament, and in the press as well. Opposing",
  "Thimayya were communists such as E. M. S. Namboodiripad, who expressed",
  "the view that the general should be court-martialled, and crypto-communist",
  "organs such as the Bombay weekly Blitz, which claimed that Thimayya had",
  "unwittingly become a tool in the hands of the \u2018American lobby\u2019. Those who",
  "sided with him in his battle with the defence minister were Blitz\u2019s great (and",
  "undeniably pro-American) rival, the weekly Current, as well as large sections",
  "of the non-ideological press. The normally pro-government Hindustan Times",
  "said that \u2018Krishna Menon must go\u2019, not Thimayya. It accused the minister of",
  "reducing the armed forces to a \u2018state of near-demoralization\u2019 by trying to cre-",
  "ate, at the highest level, a cell of officers who would be personally loyal to",
  "him.14",
  "Some hoped that the outcry over Thimayya\u2019s resignation would force",
  "Krishna Menon to also hand in his papers. Writing to the general, a leading",

  "allegation\u2019 that \u2018the independent Government of India are seeking to reap",

  "By this time, the India\u2013China exchange comprised bullets as well as",

  "deeply contested border.20",
  "IV",
  "By 1959, at least, it was clear that the Indian and Chinese positions were irre-",
  "concilable. The Indians insisted that the border was, for the most part, recog-",
  "nizedandassuredbytreatyandtradition; theChinesearguedthatithadnever",
  "really been delimited. The claims of both governments rested in part on the",
  "legacy of imperialism; British imperialism (for India), and Chinese imperial-",
  "ism(overTibet)forChina.Inthissense,bothclaimedsovereigntyoverterrit-",
  "ory acquired by less-than-legitimate means.In retrospect, it appears that the Indians underestimated the force of",
  "Chinese resentment against \u2018Western imperialism\u2019. In the first half of the",
  "twentiethcentury,whentheircountrywasweak,ithadbeensubjecttoallsorts",
  "of indignities by the European powers. The McMahon Line was one of them.",
  "Nowthat,underthecommunists,Chinawasstrong,itwasdeterminedtoundo",
  "the injustices of the past. Visiting Peking in November 1959, the Indian law-",
  "yer Danial Latifi was told by his Chinese colleagues that \u2018the McMahon Line",
  "had no juridical basis\u2019. Public opinion in China appeared \u2018to have worked it-",
  "self up to a considerable pitch\u2019 on the border issue. Reporting his conversa-",
  "tions to Jawaharlal Nehru, Latifi tellingly observed, \u2018As you know, probably",
  "too well, it is difficult in any country to make concessions once the public",
  "has been told it [the territory under dispute] forms part of the national home-",
  "land.\u201921",
  "It is also easy in retrospect to see that, after the failure of the Tibetan re-",
  "volt, the government of India should have done one or both of the following:",
  "(i) strengthened its defences along the Chinese border, importing arms from",
  "the West if need be; (ii) worked seriously for afresh settlement of the border",
  "with China. But the non-alignment of Nehru precluded the former and the",
  "force of public opinion precluded the latter. In October 1959 the Times of In-",
  "diacomplained thattheprimeminister hadshown\u2018anover-scrupulousregard",
  "for Chinese susceptibilities and comparative indifference towards the anger",
  "and dismay with which the Indian people have reacted\u2019.22 Another newspaper",
  "observed that Nehru was \u2018standing alone against the rising tide of national re-",
  "sentment against China\u2019.23",
  "As Steven Hoffman has suggested, the policy of releasing White Papers",
  "limited Nehru\u2019s options. Had the border dispute remained private the prime",
  "minister could have used the quieter back-channels of diplomatic comprom-",
  "ise. But with the matter out in the open, sparking much angry comment, he",
  "could only \u2018adopt those policies that could conceivably meet with approval",
  "from an emotionally aroused parliament and press\u2019. The White Paper policy",
  "precluded the spirit of give and take, and instead fanned patriotic sentiment.",
  "The Kongka Pass incident, in particular, had led to furious calls for revenge",
  "from India\u2019s political class.24",
  "After the border clashes of September and October 1959, Chou En-",
  "lai wrote suggesting that both sides withdraw twenty kilometres behind the",
  "McMahon Line in the east, and behind the line of actual control in the west.",
  "Nehru, in reply, dismissed the suggestion as merely a way of legitimizing",
  "Chinese encroachments in the western sector, of keeping \u2018your forcible pos-",
  "session intact\u2019. The \u2018cause of the recent troubles\u2019, he insisted, \u2018is action takenfrom your side of the border\u2019. Chou now pointed out that, despite its belief",
  "that the McMahon Line was illegal, China had adhered to a policy of \u2018abso-",
  "lutely not allowing its armed personnel to cross this line [while] waiting for a",
  "friendly settlement of the boundary question\u2019. Thus,",
  "the Chinese Government has not up to now made any demand in regard",
  "to the area south of the so-called McMahon line as a precondition or in-",
  "terim measure, and what I find difficult to understand is why the Indian",
  "Government should demand that the Chinese side withdraw one-sidedly",
  "from its western frontier area.",

  "Writing in the Economic Weekly in January 1960, the Sinologist Owen",
  "Lattimore astutely summed up the Indian dilemma. Since the boundary with",
  "China was self-evidently a legacy of British imperialism, the \u2018cession of a",

  "sent a note to the prime minister reminding him of the \u2018popular feeling\u2019 with",
  "regard to China. They asked for an assurance that in his talks with Chou",

  "Bhave, would be free of anger, bitterness and suspicion.",
  "It was not a message that went down well or widely. Five days before",
  "Chou En-lai was due, the Jana Sangh held a large demonstration outside theprime minister\u2019s residence. Protesters held up placards reminding Nehru not",
  "toforgetthemartyrs ofLadakh andnottosurrender Indianterritory.Thenext",

  "wheretheprimeminister waswarnedthatifhestruckadealwiththeChinese",
  "his \u2018only allies would be the Communists and crypto-Communists\u2019. In this",
  "climate, the respected editor Frank Moraes thought the talks were doomed",
  "to failure. The gulf between the two countries was \u2018unbridgeable\u2019, he wrote,",
  "adding: \u2018If Mr Chou insists on maintaining all the old postures, all that Mr",
  "Nehrucan tell him politely is to go back to Peking and think again.\u2019",
  "Nehru, however, insisted that the Chinese prime minister \u2018would be ac-",
  "cordedacourteouswelcomebefittingthebesttraditionsofthiscountry\u2019.Chou",
  "was then on a visit to Burma; an Indian viscount went to pick him up and",
  "fly him to Delhi. When he came in 1956, he had been given a stirring pub-",
  "lic reception; this time \u2013 despite the Indian prime minister\u2019s hopes \u2013 he ar-",
  "rived \u2018amidst unprecedented security arrangements\u2019, travelling from the air-",
  "port in a closed car. The Hindu Mahasabha organized a \u2018black flag\u2019 demon-",
  "stration against Chou, but his visit was also opposed by the more mainstream",
  "parties. Two jokes doing the rounds expressed the mood in New Delhi. One",
  "held that \u2018Hindi-Chini Bhai Bhai\u2019 had become \u2018Hindi-Chini Bye Bye\u2019; the",
  "otheraskedwhyKrishnaMenonwasnotintheIndiandelegationforthetalks,",
  "and answered, \u2018Because he is in Mr Chou En-lai\u2019s party.\u201932",
  "Chou En-lai spent a week in New Delhi, meeting Nehru every day, with",
  "and without aides. A photograph reproduced in the Indian Express after the",
  "second day of the talks suggested that they were not going well. It showed",
  "Chou raising a toast to Sino-Indian friendship, by clinking his glass with Mrs",
  "Indira Gandhi\u2019s. Mrs Gandhi was stylishly dressed, in asari, but was looking",
  "quizzically across to her father. On the other side of the table stood Nehru,",
  "capless, drinking deeply and glumly from a wine glass while avoiding Chou",
  "En-lai\u2019sgaze.TheonlyIndianshowinganyinterestatallwasthevice-presid-",
  "ent, S. Radhakrishnan, seen reaching across to clink his glass with Chou\u2019s.",
  "Chou En-lai and Nehru spent nearly twenty hours in conversation. The",
  "transcripts of their talks are still officially secret, but copies kept by a vigilant",
  "(or rule-breaking) official have been consulted by this writer. These highlight",
  "vividly the hurt and hostility that pervaded the discussion. Nehru began by",
  "recalling all that India had done for China, such as introducing its leaders to",
  "theAsia-AfricaconferenceatBandungandpushingitscaseintheUnitedNa-",
  "tions. In the light of these good turns, the Chinese \u2018infringement\u2019 of India\u2019s",

  "which was that in view of the friendship, ancient and modern, between Indiaand China, \u2018the activities of the Dalai Lama and his followers have far ex-",
  "ceeded the limits of political asylum\u2019.",
  "For two days Nehru and Chou traded charges and counter-charges. If",
  "the Indian insisted that the Himalaya had long been considered his country\u2019s",
  "natural as well as demographic frontier, then the Chinese dismissed the",
  "McMahon Line as a pernicious legacy of imperialism. Both prime ministers",
  "showed an excellent grasp of detail, each defending his case with impressive",
  "exactitude, each mentioning specific villages, valleys, hilltops, rivers, posts",
  "and treaties to make or advance his country\u2019s claims. Finally, Chou suggested",
  "thattheytryto\u2018seekasolution\u2019ratherthan\u2018repeatarguments\u2019.Asuitableset-",
  "tlement, in his view, would be that \u2018neither side should put forward claims to",
  "an area which is no longer under its administrative control\u2019. Some hours later",
  "hebecamemoreexplicit,whenhesaidthat\u2018intheeasternsector,weacknow-",
  "ledge that what India considers its border has been reached by India\u2019s actual",
  "administration. But, similarly, we think that India should accept that China\u2019s",
  "administrativepersonnelhasreachedthelinewhichitconsiderstobeherbor-",
  "der in the western sector\u2019.",
  "Again, suitably decoded, this meant \u2013 your case is stronger in the west,",
  "butourneedsaregreaterthere.Andwhileourcaseisstrongerintheeast,per-",
  "haps more of your interests are at stake there. Please keep Tawang and its en-",
  "virons, Chou was saying, for all we want is Aksai Chin and the road linking",
  "Sinkiang and Tibet.",
  "Chou advocated the retention and recognition of the status quo, but as",
  "Nehru pointed out in reply, that term was itself disputed. \u2018The question is,",
  "what is status quo?\u2019 said the Indian Prime Minister. For \u2018the status quo of",
  "today is different from the status quo of one or two years ago. To maintain",
  "today\u2019sstatusquowouldbeveryunfairifitisdifferentfromapreviousstatus",
  "quo. The solution suggested by Chou would justify what, in Nehru\u2019s (and In-",
  "dia\u2019s) view, were gains made illegally and by stealth by China.33",
  "Chou En-lai also met the home minister, G. B. Pant, and the vice-presid-",
  "ent, Dr S. Radhakrishnan, both of whom complained, more in sorrow than in",
  "anger, of China\u2019s lack of appreciation for all India had done to gain its com-",
  "munist government legitimacy in the eyes of the world. Chou was more com-",
  "batively challenged by the brilliant and opinionated finance minister, Morarji",
  "Desai. When the Chinese leader asked how the Indians could have allowed",
  "theirsoiltobeusedbyTibetandissidents,Desaiansweredthat\u2018inourcountry",
  "everybodyholdsconventions;theAlgeriansdosoandsodotheIndianssome-",

  "a Sinkiang map of the 1930s showed the Kunlun rather than the Karakoram",
  "to have been the customary boundary \u2013 which had been the Indian claim all",
  "along. At least in the western sector (where the Chinese transgressions had",
  "taken place) India seemed to have the stronger case. \u2018The Indian Government",
  "was both thorough and careful in presenting its case\u2019, whereas the Chinese",
  "presentationwasmarkedbya\u2018mazeofinternalinconsistencies,quotationsout",
  "of context, and even blatant and easily discernible falsehoods\u2019.35",

  "sources \u2013 even from unaffiliated travellers and itinerant Jesuit priests \u2013 was",
  "dismissed as tainted by \u2018imperialism\u2019. The Chinese would, up to a point,",

  "western sector, where their historical position was weak. In exchange, they",
  "werewillingtoforfeittheirmuchstrongerclaims intheeast.Thiswasclearly",

  "started in Tibet\u2019. He accused India of wanting to \u2018turn China\u2019s Tibet region",
  "into a \u201cbuffer zone\u201d\u2019. \u2018They don\u2019t want Tibet to become a Socialist Tibet, as",

  "by various linguistic groups left dissatisfied by the recommendations of the",

  "placed in the role of the Jews, and the Indian government as the Nazis) and to",
  "the Christian sentiments of his audience. The rhetoric was somewhat artless,",
  "and yet surprisingly successful. His cause was taken up by David Astor, the",
  "liberal owner of the Observer newspaper who had played a stellar role in the",
  "fight against the Nazis. Phizo\u2019s charges were given wide play by the paper,",
  "and by several other journals too.45",
  "Always sensitive to the opinions of the British press, the government of",
  "India answered with a propagandist tract of its own. This said that while the",
  "primeministerhadassuredtheNagasof\u2018maximumautonomy\u2019,underPhizo\u2019s",
  "leadership, \u2018the Naga movement began to assume a violent character\u2019. The",
  "extent ofviolence andthesufferingofcivilians wasnotdenied,buttheblame",
  "for this was placed on the insurgents. The government\u2019s stand remained that",
  "\u2018they are prepared to concede the largest possible autonomy to the Nagas in",
  "theirinternalaffairsinadditiontoalltheprivilegesofIndiancitizenship,suchas representation in Parliament, but they could not agree to an independent",
  "state for them\u2019.",
  "This was reasonably put, but the effect was spoilt by an appendix which",
  "cast Phizo as a villain motivated merely by frustration and failure:",
  "Phizo\u2019s mental attitude has been conditioned by a series of frustrations",
  "andsetbacks.HefailedintheMatriculationexamination.Hisattemptsto",

  "beenknowntohavebeensufferingfromastrongfeelingofguiltforhav-",
  "ing misled his co-tribesmen into a path of hostility and violence, result-",
  "ing in many deaths and reducing many of them to a state of misery.46",
  "However, between the government of India and the leader of the Naga",
  "National Council stood a number of \u2018moderate\u2019 Nagas. These had banded to-",
  "gether in a Naga Peoples\u2019 Convention which, from 1957 onwards, had be-",
  "gun seeking a peaceful settlement to the problem. The Aos were prominent",
  "among these peacemakers, but there were representatives of other tribes too.",
  "On 30 July 1960 the Naga Peoples\u2019 Convention presented a memorandum to",
  "the prime minister demanding a separate state of Nagaland within the Indian",
  "Union.Thiswouldhaveitsowngovernor,chiefminister,councilofministers,",
  "andlegislative assembly,andtheUnionParliament wouldnothavethepower",
  "to interfere with Naga religion, social practices or customary law.47",
  "The demand for a Naga state within India was resisted by the Assamese",
  "elite, loath to let go of any part of their province. But with the Naga question",
  "nowsuccessfullyinternationalized,Nehruthoughtitprudenttomakethecon-",
  "cession. In the first week of August 1960 he announced in Parliament that a",
  "state of Nagaland was to be carved out of Assam. The decision to create this,",
  "the smallest state of the Union, gave rise to a series of responses that were in-",
  "teresting, varied and yet utterly predictable. The right-wing Jana Sangh saw",
  "thecreationofNagalandas\u2018anactfraughtwithexplosivepossibilities\u2019;itwas",
  "a concession to terror, \u2018tantamount to putting a premium on violence and re-",
  "bellion\u2019, a wanton encouragement to \u2018regionalism and parochialism\u2019 which",
  "would endanger \u2018the unity and integrity of the country\u2019 . Some other tribes in",
  "Assam, the Khasis, the Garos and the Jaintias, resolved to fight for a state of",
  "their own, to be called \u2018Eastern Frontier\u2019.48Also predictable was the response of Phizo\u2019s men. Some Naga intellec-",
  "tualsthoughtthatthegrantingofstatehoodwithinIndiawas\u2018notonlyallthey",
  "can hope to get but all they need to protect their social and political identity\u2019.",
  "But how was one to convince the ordinary villager of this? For, as one news-",

  "More worrying, at least to Nehru, was the resurgence of communal con-",
  "flict after a decade of comparative social peace. In June 1960 virulent anti-",
  "Bengali riots broke out in Assam. The victims were post-Partition refugees",
  "from East Bengal, who were accused of taking jobs from the Assamese and",
  "not speaking their language. Thousands of homes were destroyed and many",
  "Bengalis killed. Others fled across the border into refugee camps in West",
  "Bengal. The home minister, Lal Bahadur Shastri, flew to Assam to forge an",
  "uneasy peace which endorsed Assamese as the official state language while",
  "permitting the use of Bengali in the district where the migrants were in a ma-",
  "jority.51",
  "Then,inJanuary1961,areligiousriotbrokeoutinthecentralIndiancity",

  "rioting continued for days, spreading also to the countryside. It was the most",
  "serious such incident since Partition, its main sufferers being poor Muslims,",
  "mostly weavers and bidi (cigarette) workers.52The troubles on the border with China and the intensification of social",
  "conflict within the country gave rise to fresh concerns about the future of",
  "democratic India. In 1960 an American scholar published an impressively",
  "learned book with a simple title \u2013 India \u2013 but a portentous subtitle: The Most",
  "DangerousDecades.Thechapterandsectiontitleswerealsorevealing\u2013\u2018Will",
  "the Union Survive?\u2019 was one, \u2018Totalitarian Equilibrium?\u2019 another. The writer",
  "was disturbed by the divisions of caste, region, religion and language, and",
  "by the rise of Indian communism. There were, he felt, \u2018seemingly irresistible",
  "compulsions of totalitarian experiments of one sort or another in the nature of",
  "the Indian Union\u2019.53",
  "The following year, 1961, the writer Aldous Huxley visited India after",
  "a gap of thirty-five years. He was overwhelmed by what he found, namely,",
  "\u2018the prospect of overpopulation, underemployment, growing unrest\u2019. \u2018India",
  "is almost infinitely depressing\u2019, he wrote to a friend, \u2018for there seems to be",
  "no solution to its problems in any way that any of us [in the West] regard",
  "as acceptable.\u2019 Writing to his brother Julian, Huxley expressed the view that",
  "\u2018whenNehrugoes,thegovernmentwillbecomeamilitarydictatorship\u2013asin",
  "so many of the newly independent states, for the army seems to be the only",
  "highly organized centre of power\u2019.54",
  "TheverdictoftheBritishintellectualwasechoedbytheworkadayjourn-",

  "thought that \u2018until now Nehru alone has been the unifying, cohesive force",
  "behind India\u2019s Government and foreign policy\u2019. But after he was gone, \u2018the",
  "powers of caste and religion, of Rightism and Leftism . . . could eventually",
  "split this country from top to bottom and plunge it back 100 years\u2019.55",

  "tions of their air space by Indian aircraft; an Indian note listed various incid-",
  "ents of ill-treatment of Indian citizens in Tibet.56",
  "These exchanges, published in successive White Papers by the govern-",
  "ment of India, led to a renewed call for Krishna Menon\u2019s head. Leading thecharge was J. B. Kripalani, the Socialist Party MP from Sitamarhi in Bihar.",
  "Scholar, teacher, khadi worker and rebel, Kripalani was an authentic hero of",
  "the Indian freedom struggle. His moral authority derived in part from the",
  "fact that he had come close to Gandhi while aiding him in the Champaran",
  "satyagrahaof1917,yearsbeforeNehruhimselfmadetheacquaintanceofthe",
  "Mahatma. Kripalani had also been president of the Congress and, of course,",
  "spent many years in jail for his cause.",
  "On 11 April 1961 Kripalani delivered what was described at the time as",
  "\u2018perhaps the greatest speech that has been made on the floor of that House",
  "since Independence\u2019. This was a blistering attack on the defence minister.",
  "Under Krishna Menon\u2019s stewardship, said Kripalani, \u2018we have lost 12,000",
  "square miles of our territory without striking a single blow\u2019. Army promo-",
  "tions, he claimed, were based not on merit but \u2018according to the whims and",
  "fancies of the defence minister or what will suit his political and ideologic-",
  "al purposes\u2019. Menon had \u2018created cliques [and] lowered the morale of our",
  "[armed] forces\u2019. In a stinging indictment, Kripalani charged the minister with",
  "\u2018wasting the money of this poor and starving nation\u2019, with \u2018the neglect of the",
  "defence of the country\u2019, and with \u2018having lent his support to the totalitarian",
  "and dictatorial regimes against the will of the people for freedom\u2019.",
  "Kripalaniendedhisspeechwithanappealtotheconscienceofthemem-",

  "afraidoftheBritishbulletsandbayonetstoplacethegoodofthenationabove",
  "the good of the party\u2019. With this parting shot Kripalani sat down, to vigorous",
  "applause from the opposition benches.57",
  "Throughout the second half of 1961 the Indian Parliament witnessed a",

  "himself magisterially above the fray. \u2018In regard to border disputes\u2019, said one",
  "member, \u2018the prime minister has a tendency to act like an umpire in a cricket",
  "match rather than as one whose interests are involved\u2019. The criticisms had a",
  "personal, polemical, edge. For Nehru also served as foreign minister, and the",
  "policy of friendship with China was known to be his particular project. Unac-",
  "customed to such hostility, the prime minister became increasingly irritable,on one occasion going so far as to refer to his critics as \u2018childish and infant-",
  "ile\u2019. 58",
  "Bynow,therewereelementsinhisownpartywhohadmadeknowntheir",

  "telling supplement: \u2018No hair grows on my head. Does it mean that the head",
  "has no value?\u2019 This was widely viewed as a dig at Nehru who, of course, was",
  "completely bald himself.59",
  "VIII",
  "In the third week of December 1961 a detachment of the Indian army moved",
  "up to the borders of the Portuguese colony of Goa. For a decade now New",
  "Delhi had sought, by persuasion and non-violence, to convince Portugal to",
  "give up that territory. With those measures failing, Nehru\u2019s government de-",
  "cided to \u2018liberate\u2019 Goa by force.",
  "On the morning of 18 December Indian troops entered Goa from three",
  "directions: Sawantwadi in the north, Karwar in the south and Belgaum in the",
  "east.Meanwhile,aeroplanesdroppedleaflets exhortingtheGoansto\u2018becalm",

  "the locals, who pointed out where the Portuguese had laid mines. The colon-",
  "ists fired a few shots before withdrawing. In the smaller enclaves of Daman",
  "and Diu the resistance was somewhat stiffer. In all, some fifteen Indian sol-",
  "diers lost their lives, and perhaps twice as many Portuguese. Thirty-six hours",
  "after the invasion began, the Portuguese governor general signed a document",
  "of unconditional surrender.60",
  "TheWesternpresshadafielddaywiththisdisplayof\u2018Indianhypocrisy\u2019.",
  "Exposed for so long to lectures by Nehru and Krishna Menon, they now hit",
  "back by attacking the use of force by a nation that professed \u2018non-violence\u2019.",
  "The action was also represented as a breach of international law and, more",
  "absurdly, as a threat to Christians and Christianity in Goa.61 In fact, 61 per",
  "cent of Goa was Hindu, while prominent Goan Christians, such as the journ-",
  "alist Frank Moraes and the Archbishop Cardinal Gracias, had an honoured",
  "placeinIndianpubliclife.Therehadlongbeenanindigenousfreedommove-",
  "ment within Goa and many, perhaps most, Goans welcomed the Indian ac-tion. In any case, the Goans were now at liberty to choose their own leaders,",
  "something always denied them by the Portuguese.",
  "That Goa was legitimately part of India was not in dispute. That India",
  "had waited long enough before acting was also evident. Still, the timing of",
  "whatwascalled\u2018OperationVijay\u2019wasopentoquestion.Whydidittakeplace",
  "inDecember1961ratherthanDecember1960orDecember1962?Nehruper-",
  "haps thought he had waited long enough for the Portuguese to leave; fourteen",
  "whole years. And he was under pressure from both left and right on the issue;",
  "theJanaSanghandthecommunists,inarareshowofagreement,wereurging",
  "him to use the army to liberate the colony. Still, the suspicion lingered that",
  "the precise timing of the invasion was determined by the electoral needs of",
  "his colleague Krishna Menon. Before the troops went in, the defence minister",
  "inspected them on the border. As the New York Times reported, he was here",
  "\u2018conductingadoublecampaign:oneforthewarthatwasabouttocommence,",
  "theotherforthegeneralelectionthathadbeenscheduledforFebruary1962.62",
  "In that election, Krishna Menon would be opposed by his Parliamentary",
  "b\u00eate noire, Acharya Kripalani, who had announced that he would shift from",
  "thesafeseatofSitamarhiandtakeonthedefenceministerintheconstituency",
  "he represented, North Bombay. All the opposition parties (the communists",
  "excepted) announced that they would support him. A battle of prestige was",
  "brewing;sincetheprimeministerhadrefusedtodropMenonfromtheCabin-",
  "et, the opposition now hoped that he would be removed via the ballot box.",
  "Less than two months after his troops marched into Goa, Menon was in",
  "Bombay to fight his corner of the 1962 general election. Batting for him were",
  "the powerful Maharashtra chief minister Y. B. Chavan and senior members",
  "of the Union Cabinet. Even Menon\u2019s known critics in government, such as",
  "Morarji Desai and Jagjivan Ram, were commanded to go out and campaign",
  "on his behalf. Speaking on Kripalani\u2019s side were such stalwarts as C. Rajago-",
  "palachari, as well as many distinguished non-party men \u2013 lawyers, intellectu-",
  "als and industrialists.",
  "The contest was, among other things, a tribute to the cosmopolitan char-",
  "acter of Bombay, with a Malayali and a Sindhi competing for the affections",
  "of the people of a state not their own. The constituency was very heterogen-",
  "eous indeed \u2013 many Marathi and Gujarati speakers, but also many Bhaiyyas",
  "from UP, Goans, Sindhis and Tamilians. These various segments were wooed",
  "by both contestants, with the campaign manifesting an intensity commensur-",
  "ate to the stature of the disputants, and the importance of their dispute.",
  "In the rich and by now very extensive history of Indian elections, there",
  "hasperhapsbeennosinglecontestsoloudlytrumpetedasthisone.Thejourn-al Link, sympathetic to Menon, called it \u2018the most important election in the",

  "ofKripalani\u2019s,saidthatinthiscontest\u2018thefutureofIndiandemocracyandour",
  "spiritual values are at stake\u2019.",
  "The campaign was colourful, replete with evocative posters and savage",
  "slogans. The left-wing weekly Blitz ran a blistering campaign against a man",
  "they chose to refer to as \u2018Cripple-loony\u2019 . On the other side, Menon was lam-",
  "pooned by versifiers in several languages. One ditty went: Chini hamla hot\u00e9",
  "hain/ Menon Saab sot\u00e9 hain/ Sona hai tho son\u00e9 do/ Kripalani ji to aan\u00e9 do.",
  "(As China advances, Menon sleeps/ Let him sleep if he must/ But call Kripa-",
  "lani to be with us.) An English verse advanced the same sentiments, if more",
  "elegantly: I do not hold with all these cracks and mockery/ At Krishna Men-",
  "on./ItishisvirtuesIwouldratherpinon./Forinstance,considerhisskillwith",
  "crockery:/ What could be finer/ Than the loving care with which he handles",

  "the liberation of Goa, which resonated well with the public of North Bombay,",

  "In the event, Kripalani\u2019s campaign was undone by Nehru\u2019s speeches, the",
  "action in Goa and the strength of the Congress Party machinery. He lost by",
  "more than 100,000 votes.63",
  "IX",
  "In the general elections of 1952 and 1957 the Congress had made much of its",
  "being the party of the freedom struggle. In 1962, however, its campaign fo-",
  "cused more on what it had done since. Its policies, it said, had increased ag-",
  "ricultural and industrial production, enhanced education and life expectancy",
  "and promoted the unity of the country. Never having held power, the oppos-",
  "ition could not match these claims with counterclaims of their own.64 In the",
  "event, the Congress comfortably retained its majority in Parliament, winning",
  "361 seats out of 494 all told. The communists secured 29 seats, while the",
  "new opposition party, Swatantra, put up a decent show, returning 18 MPs. Inthe state of Madras there was a challenge from the quasi-secessionist DMK,",
  "whichwon7Parliamentary seats(togowith50intheLegislative Assembly).",
  "But on the whole the Congress Party was confirmed in its pre-eminence, and",
  "Jawaharlal Nehru entered into his fourth term as prime minister.",
  "The opposition within had been shown its place, but the opposition",
  "without remained. Throughout the spring and summer of 1962 clashes on the",
  "border continued. In July the Delhi journal Seminar ran a symposium on In-",
  "dia\u2019s defence policy. One contributor insisted that \u2018the People\u2019s Republic of",
  "China does not pose any military threat to our country\u2019. Another contributor",
  "was not so sure. This was General Thimayya, now retired, who noted that",
  "therewerethreatsfrombothPakistanandChina.Wherethecountrywasmod-",
  "erately well placed to meet an attack from the former, Thimayya could not",
  "\u2018even as a soldier envisage India taking on China in an open conflict on its",
  "own. China\u2019s present strength in manpower, equipment and aircraft exceeds",
  "our resources a hundred fold with the full support of the USSR, and we could",
  "never hope to match China in the foreseeable future. It must be left to the",
  "politicians and the diplomats to ensure our security\u2019. The \u2018present strength of",
  "the army and air forces of India\u2019, said the general, \u2018are even below the \u201cmin-",
  "imum insurance\u201d we can give to our people\u2019.65",
  "The implications were clear: either the diplomats should seek a treaty",
  "deal with China, or the politicians should canvass for military help from the",
  "Western bloc. But the rising tide of patriotic sentiment ruled out the first; and",
  "the non-alignment of the prime minister, strengthened by the anti-American-",
  "ism of his defence minister, ruled out the second.",
  "In the third week of July 1962 there were clashes between Indian and",
  "Chinese troops in the Galwan valley of Ladakh. Then, in early September, a",
  "conflict arose over the Dhola/Thag La ridge, in the valley of the Namka Chu",
  "river, some sixty miles west of Tawang. The region was where the borders of",
  "India, Tibet and Bhutan all met; the exact alignment of the McMahon Line",
  "was in dispute here. The Indians claimed the ridge fell south of the Line; the",
  "Chinese argued that it was on their side.66",
  "It was back in June that a platoon of the Assam Rifles had established a",
  "post at Dhola, as part of the still continuing forward policy. On 8 September",
  "the Chinese placed a post of their own at Thag La, which overlooked (and",
  "threatened) Dhola. Peking and New Delhi exchanged angry letters. On the",
  "ground, Indian commanders were divided as to what todo. Some said that the",
  "Chinese must be shifted from Thag La. Others said that it would be too diffi-",
  "cult, since the terrain was disadvantageous to the Indians (Thag La lay some",
  "2,000feetaboveDhola).Meanwhile,atthesiteitself,theChinesetroopstookto addressing homilies in Hindi via a megaphone. \u2018Hindi-Chini bhai bhai\u2019,",

  "pared. That night, wrote the New York Times, a \u2018smouldering situation burst",
  "into flame\u2019 as \u2018heavy battles broke out in both of the disputed areas. Massesof Chinese troops under the cover of thunderous mortar fire drove the Indians",
  "back on each front\u2019. Both sides had built up forces on the border, but \u2018inde-",
  "pendent observers laid the onslaught to the Chinese\u2019. The Chinese attacked",
  "in waves, armed with medium machine guns backed by heavy mortars. Two",
  "Chinese divisions were involved in the invasion, these using five times as",
  "many troops as had the Indians.69",
  "The Indians were \u2018taken by surprise\u2019 as the Chinese quickly overran",
  "many positions, crossed the Namkha Chu valley and made for the monastery",
  "in Tawang. Another detachment made for the eastern part of NEFA. Chinese",
  "troops moved deeper and deeper into Indian territory. Eight posts were repor-",

  "come as a surprise. Their troops had been on the Tibetan plateau in strength",
  "from the mid-1950s, fighting or preparing to fight Khampa rebels. Unlike the",
  "Indians, they were well used to battles in the high mountains. Besides, access",
  "was much easier from the Tibetan side, the relatively flat terrain conducive to",

  "The Indian problems were compounded by a vacuum of leadership. On",

  "Nehru\u2019s speech might be read as a belated acknowledgement of the cor-",
  "rectness of Vallabhbhai Patel\u2019s warning of 1950: that communism in China",

  "debate that followed took a full week; 165 members spoke, apparently a re-",

  "Back on the borders, the lull in the fighting was broken by a second",
  "Chinese offensive on 15 November. A 500-mile front was attacked in NEFA.",

  "But across most of NEFA it had been a very poor show indeed. Here the",
  "Indianssimplydisintegrated, withplatoonsandevenwholeregimentsretreat-",

  "among the Indian commanders. Where should they make their first, and per-",
  "haps last, stand? The option of Tawang was considered and abandoned. One",
  "general advocated Bomdi Lal, a good sixty miles to the south, where supplies",
  "couldbeeasilysentupfromplains.Finally,itwasdecidedtostoptheChinese",
  "advance at Se La, a mere fifteen miles from Tawang.",
  "The decision to make the stand at Se La was Kaul s. When he fell ill,",
  "his place had been taken by Lieutenant General Harbaksh Singh, a highly re-",
  "garded commander with much field experience. But before Singh could ad-",
  "equately reorganize the defences, Kaul had flown back from Delhi to resume",
  "charge once more.",
  "The Chinese had occupied Tawang on 25 October. When they halted",
  "there,theIndiansweredeceivedintoinaction.Infact,theChinesewerework-",

  "Meanwhile, battles broke out north of Se La, the Chinese again with the ad-",
  "vantage. The garrison commander, in panic, ordered withdrawal, and his bri-",

  "had already skirted Se La and cut off the road behind them. Large sections",

  "The recruiting centres were usually sleepy places, open one or two days a",
  "week, with 90 per cent of the boys who showed up failing the first exam-",
  "ination. Now their compounds were \u2018besieged by thousands of would-be re-",
  "cruits\u2019. Some were labourers and factory hands; others, unemployed gradu-",
  "ates. They all hoped that in this emergency \u2018the army will lower its physical",
  "requirements and give them food and lodging and a purpose in life\u2019.80It seems unlikely that these men would have made a better showing than",
  "those who had already fought, and lost. In any case, they did not get the",
  "chance. Poised to enter the plains of Assam, the Chinese instead announced",
  "a unilateral ceasefire on 22 November. In NEFA they pulled back to north of",
  "the McMahon Line. In the Ladakh sector they likewise retreated to positions",
  "they had held before the present hostilities began.",
  "WhydidtheChinesepackupandgohome?Somethoughttheywerede-",

  "While the end of the war can be thus explained, its origins are harder to",
  "understand. There were no White Papers issued from the Chinese side, and",
  "their records are not open \u2013 and perhaps never will be. All one can say is that",
  "behindsuchacarefullyco-ordinatedattacktheremusthavebeenseveralyears",
  "of preparation. As for its precise timing, a speculation offered at the time and",
  "which still seems plausible was that the two superpowers, the Soviet Union",
  "and the United States, were preoccupied with the Cuban missile crisis, allow-",
  "ing Peking its little adventure without fear of reprisal.",
  "The border war had underlined Chinese superiority in \u2018arms, commu-",
  "nications, strategy, logistics, and planning\u2019.82 According to Defence Ministry",
  "statistics, 1,383 Indian soldiers had been killed, 3,968 were taken prisoner,",
  "while 1,696 were still missing.83 These losses were small by the standards of",
  "modern warfare, yet the war represented a massive defeat in the Indian ima-",
  "gination. Naturally, the search began for scapegoats. Over the years, a series",
  "of self-exculpatory memoirs were published by the generals in the field. Each",
  "soughttoshifttheblameawayfromhimselfandtowardsanothercommander,",
  "ortowardsthepoliticians whohadneglected their warningsandissuedorders",
  "that were impossible to carry out. In his own contribution to the genre, Major",
  "General D. K. Palit \u2013 director general of military operations at the time of the",
  "war notes that in these memoirs \u2018there are striking inconsistencies; each had",
  "his own wicket to defend\u2019. Then he adds: \u2018Hindsight tends to lend rationality",
  "to events that in fact are innocent of coherence or logical sequence.\u201984",
  "AmongtheIndianpublic,theprincipalsentimentwasthatofbetrayal,of",
  "being taken for a ride by an unscrupulous neighbour whom they had naively",
  "chosen to trust and support. In his letters to Chou En-lai, Nehru expressed",
  "these feelings as well as anyone else. But for the deeper origins of the disputeone must turn to his earlier writings, in particular to an interview in which he",
  "spoke not as India\u2019s leader but as a student of world history. Back in 1959,",
  "Nehru had told Edgar Snow that \u2018the basic reason for the Sino-Indian dispute",
  "was that they were both \u201cnew nations\u201d, in that both were newly independent",
  "and under dynamic nationalistic leaderships, and in a sense were \u201cmeeting\u201d",
  "at their frontiers for the first time in history\u2019. In the past, \u2018there were buffer",
  "zones between the two countries; both sides were remote from the borders\u2019.",
  "Now, however, \u2018they were meeting as modern nations on the borders\u2019. Hence",
  "it\u2018wasnaturalthatacertaindegreeofconflictshouldbegeneratedbeforethey",
  "can stabilize their frontiers\u2019.85",
  "The India-China conflict, then, was a clash of national myths, national",
  "egos, national insecurities and \u2013 ultimately and inevitably \u2013 national armies.",
  "In this sense, however unique (and uniquely disturbing) it must have seemed",
  "to Indians, it was very representative. For competing claims to territory have",
  "beenanalltoocommonsourceofconflictinthemodernworld.Nehru\u2019scom-",
  "ments to Edgar Snow said as much. However, let us give the last word to",
  "an unlikely authority, the beat poet Allen Ginsberg. In March 1962 Ginsberg",
  "beganatwo-yeartriparoundthesubcontinent,bummingandslumminginthe",
