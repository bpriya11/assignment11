  "political problemthelikeofwhichnonewlyindependent statehadeverfaced",
  "(or is likely to face in the future). For when the British departed the subcon-",
  "tinent they left behind more than 500 distinct pieces of territory. Two of these",
  "were the newly created nations of India and Pakistan; the others comprised",
  "the assorted chiefdoms and states that made up what was known as \u2018princely",
  "India\u2019. The dissolution of these units is a story of extraordinary interest, told",
  "from a partisan point of view half a century ago in V. P. Menon\u2019s Integration",
  "of the Indian States, but not else where or since.7",
  "II",
  "The princely states were somanythat there waseven disagreement astotheir",
  "number. One historian puts it at 521; another at 565. They were more than",
  "500, by any count, and they varied very widely in terms of size and status. At",
  "one end of the scale were the massive states of Kashmir and Hyderabad, each",
  "the size of a large European country; at the other end, tiny fiefdoms or jagirs",
  "of a dozen or less villages.",
  "The larger princely states were the product of the longue dur\u00e9e of Indian",
  "history as much as of British policy. Some states made much of having resis-",

  "Himalayan north, were scarcely touched by Islamic influence at all.",
  "Whatever their past history, these states owed their mid-twentieth-cen-",
  "tury shape and powers \u2013 or lack thereof \u2013 to the British. Starting as a firm of",
  "traders, the East India Company gradually moved towards a position of over-",
  "lordship. They were helped here by the decline of the Mughals after the death",
  "of Aurangzeb in 1707. Indian rulers were seen by the Company as strategic",
  "allies, useful in checking the ambitions of their common enemy, the French.",

  "also transferred valuable areas from the Indian states to the British. It was no",
  "accident that, except for the states comprising Kathia-war and two chiefdoms",
  "in the south, no Indian state had a coastline. The political dependence was",
  "made more acute by economic dependence, with the states relying on British",
  "India for raw materials, industrial goods, and employment opportunities.8",

  "Congress umbrella rested the All-India States Peoples Conference, to which",
  "in turn were affiliated the individual praja mandals (or peoples\u2019 societies) of",
  "the states.",
  "Even in their heyday the princes got a bad press. They were generally",
  "viewed as feckless and dissolute, over-fond of racehorses and other men\u2019s",
  "wives and holidays in Europe. Both the Congress and the Raj thought that",

  "ive series of elections, but these left untouched the princely states. As a con-",
  "sequence there was a \u2018growing antipathy towards princely governments\u2019.10",
  "Their constitutional status, however, remained ambiguous. The Cabinet Mis-sion of 1946 focused on the Hindu\u2013Muslim or United India versus Pakistan",
  "question; it barely spoke of the states at all. Likewise the statement of 20",
  "February1947,formallyannouncingthattheRajwastoend,alsofinessedthe",
  "question. On 3 June the British announced both the date of their final with-",
  "drawal and the creation of two dominions \u2013 but this statement also did not",
  "make clear the position of the states. Some rulers began now \u2018to luxuriate in",
  "wild dreams of independent power in an India of many partitions\u2019.11",

  "would now rule India.13",
  "One of the first princes to come over to Patel\u2019s side was the Maharaja",
  "of Bikaner. His dewan was K. M. Pannikar, awidely respected historian who,",
  "more clearly than otherpeople, could see that the \u2018Vasco da Gama epoch of",
  "Asian history\u201914 was swiftly coming to an end. The forces of nationalism",
  "were irresistible; if one did not compromise with them, one would be swept",
  "away.Accordingly,inthefirstweekofApril1947Bikanerissuedapublicap-",
  "peal to his fellow princes to join the Constituent Assembly. Their entry into",
  "the Assembly, he said, would \u2018make quite clear to everyone that the IndianPrinces are not only workingfor the good of their States and for their mother",
  "country but are above all patriotic and worthy sons of India\u2019.15",
  "The first chiefdom to join the Constituent Assembly, back in February,",
  "had in fact been the state of Baroda. After Bikaner\u2019s appeal a dozen more",
  "states joined, many of them from Rajasthan. Pannikar and Bikaner had \u2018led",
  "the Rajput princes in a fresh act of traditional obeisance to Delhi, where in",

  "Several states in Rajasthan,Bikaner included, would share aborder",
  "withPakistan; this, and ancient memories of battles withMuslim kings, pre-",
  "disposed them to an early compromise with Congress. But other states in the",
  "hinterland were less sure how far Delhi\u2019s writ would run after the British left.",
  "Might not the situation revert tothat of the eighteenth century, when the pen-",
  "insula wasdivided up among dozens of more-or-less sovereign states?",
  "On 27 June a newStates Department was set up by the government of",
  "India. This replaced the old Political Department, whose pro-princes, anti-",
  "Congress tenor had caused so much mischief.17 Patel wouldbethe minister in",
  "charge. As hissecretary he chose V. P. Menon, asmall, alert and ferociously",

  "on had come from the ranks.Far from being a member of the elite Indian",
  "Civil Service \u2013 as other secretaries to government were \u2013 he had joined the",
  "government of India asaclerk and steadily worked hisway up. He had been",
  "reforms commissioner and constitutional adviser to successive viceroys, and",
  "had played a key role in drafting the Indian Independence Bill.",
  "His peers in the ICS derisively called him \u2018babu Menon\u2019, in reference to",
  "hislowlyorigins.Infact,asBritishRajgavewaytoCongressRaj,therecould",
  "have been no better man to supervise this most tricky aspect of the transition.",
  "Menon\u2019s first act was to urge the British government not to support fanci-",
  "ful claims to independence. \u2018Even an inkling that H.M.G. would accord inde-",
  "pendent recognition\u2019, he told London, \u2018would make infinitely difficult all at-",
  "temptstobringtheStatesandthenewDominionstogetheronallvitalmatters",
  "of common concern.\u201918",
  "Menon was also ideally placed to mediate between his old boss, Mount-",
  "batten, and his new boss, Vallabhbhai Patel. Between them they worked on a",
  "draftInstrument ofAccession wherebythestates wouldagree totransfer con-",
  "trol of defence, foreign affairs and communications to the Congress govern-",
  "ment. On 5 July Patel issued a statement appealing to the princes to accede to",
  "the Indian Union on these three subjects and join the Constituent Assembly.",
  "As he put it, the \u2018alternative to co-operation in the general interest\u2019 was \u2018an-archy and chaos\u2019. Patel appealed to the princes\u2019 patriotism, asking for their",
  "assistance in raising \u2018this sacred land to its proper place among the nations of",
  "the world\u2019.19",
  "On 9 July Patel and Nehru both met the viceroy, and asked him \u2018what he",
  "was going to do to help India in connection with her most pressing problem \u2013",
  "relations with the [princely] States\u2019. Mountbatten agreed to make this matter",
  "\u2018hisprimaryconsideration\u2019.LaterthatsamedayGandhicametomeetMount-",

  "my power to ensure that the British did not leave a legacy of Balkanisation",
  "and disruption on the 15th August by encouraging the States to declare their",
  "independence . . . \u201920",
  "Mountbatten was being urged by the Congress trinity to bat for them",
  "against the states. This he did most effectively, notably in a speech to the",
  "Chamber of Princes delivered on 25 July, for which the viceroy had decked",
  "out in all his finery, rows of military medals pinned upon his chest. He was,",
  "recalledanadoringassistant,\u2018infulluniform,withanarrayofordersanddec-",
  "orations calculated to astonish even these practitioners in Princely pomp\u2019.21",
  "Mountbatten began by telling the princes that the Indian Independence",
  "Act had released \u2018the States from all their obligations to the Crown\u2019. They",
  "were now technically independent, or, put another way, rudderless, on their",
  "own. The old links were broken, but \u2018if nothing can be put in its place, only",
  "chaos can result\u2019 \u2013 a chaos that \u2018will hit the States first\u2019. He advised them to",
  "forge relations with the new nation closest to them. As he brutally put it, \u2018you",
  "cannot run away from the Dominion Government which is your neighbour",
  "any more than you can run away from the subjects for whose welfare you are",
  "responsible\u2019.",
  "TheInstrument ofAccession theprinces werebeingaskedtosignwould",
  "cede away defence \u2013 but in any case, said Mountbatten, the states would,",
  "by themselves, \u2018be cut off from any source of supplies of up-to-date arms or",
  "weapons\u2019. It would cede away external affairs, but the princes could \u2018hardly",
  "wanttogototheexpenseofhavingambassadorsorministersorconsulsinall",
  "these foreign countries\u2019. And it would also cede away communications, but",

  "authority\u2019 while divesting them of matters they could not deal with on their",

  "Mountbatten\u2019s talk to the Chamber of Princes was a tour de force. In my",
  "opinion it ranks as the most significant of all his acts in India. It finally per-suaded the princes that the British would no longer protect or patronize them,",
  "and that independence for them was a mirage.",
  "Mountbatten had prefaced his speech with personal letters to the more",
  "important princes. Afterwards he continued to press them to sign the Instru-",

  "went back on the undertaking that if the princes signed up on the three speci-",
  "fied subjects, \u2018in other matters we would scrupulously respect their autonom-",
  "ous existence\u2019.24 The praja mandals grew active once more. In Mysore a",

  "Through the latter part of 1947 V. P. Menon toured India, cajoling the",
  "princes one by one. His progress, wrote the New York Times correspondent in",
  "New Delhi,",
  "could be measured from the ensuing series of modest newspaper items,",
  "each series running about like this:",
  "First, a small headline, \u2018Mr V. P. Menon Visits Stateof Chhota",
  "Hazri\u2019;",
  "Then,intheGovernor-General\u2019sdailyCourtCircular,abriefnotice,",
  "\u2018H. H. the Maharajah of Chhota Hazri has arrived\u2019;",
  "And soon, a banner headline, \u2018CHHOTA HAZRI MERGED\u2019.28",
  "As this account makes clear, the groundwork was done by Patel and V. P.",
  "Menon; but the finishing touch was applied by Mountbatten, a final interviewwith whom was sometimes a necessary concession to princely vanity. The",
  "governorgeneralalsovisitedthemoreimportantchiefdoms,wherehesaluted",
  "their \u2018most wise and Statesmanlike decision\u2019 to link up with India.29",
  "Mountbatten dealt with the symbolism of the princes\u2019 integration with",
  "India; V. P. Menon with the substance. In his book, Menon describes in",
  "some detail the tortuous negotiations with the rulers. The process of give and",
  "take involved much massaging of egos: one ruler claimed descent from Lord",
  "Rama, another from Sri Krishna, while a third said his lineage was immortal,",
  "as it had been blessed by the Sikh Gurus.",
  "In exchange for their land each ruler was offered a \u2018privy purse\u2019, its size",
  "determined by the revenue earned by the state. The bigger, more strategically",
  "placed states had to be given better deals, but relevant too were such factors",
  "astheantiquityoftherulingdynasty,thereligioushalowhichmightsurround",
  "it, and their martial traditions. Apart from an annual purse, the rulers were",
  "allowed to retain their palaces and other personal properties and, as signific-",
  "antly, their titles. The Maharaja of Chhota Hazri would still be the Maharaja",
  "of Chhota Hazri, and he could pass on the title to his son as well.30",
  "Toreassuretheprinces,Patelsoughttoincludeaconstitutionalguarantee",
  "with regard to the privy purses. But, as V. P. Menon pointed out, the pay-off",
  "had been trifling compared to the gains. In addition to securing the political",
  "consolidation of India, the integration of the states was, in economic terms, a",
  "veritable steal. By Menon\u2019s calculation, while the government would pay out",
  "some Rs150 million to the princes, in ten years\u2019 time the revenue from their",
  "states would amount to at least ten times as much.31",
  "Acquiring the territory of the States was followed by the scarcely less",

  "prior to the holding of full-fledged elections.",
  "Patel and Menon took more than one leaf out of the British book. They",
  "played \u2018divide-and-rule\u2019, bringing some princes on side early, unsettling the",
  "rest. They played on the childlike vanities of the maharajas, allowing them to",
  "retaintheirtitlesandsometimesgivingthemnewones.(Thusseveralmahara-",

  "by any reckoning, was a stupendous achievement. It had been brought about",
  "by wisdom, foresight, hard work and not a little intrigue.",
  "IV",
  "When Vallabhbhai Patel had first discussed the states problem with Mount-",
  "batten, he had asked him to bring in \u2018a full basket of apples\u2019 by the date of",
  "Independence. Would he be satisfied with a bag of 560 instead of the full",
  "565, wondered the viceroy. The Congress strongman nodded his assent.33 As",
  "it turned out, only three states gave trouble before 15 August, and three more",
  "afterthat date.",
  "TravancorewasthefirststatetoquestiontherightoftheCongresstosuc-",
  "ceed the British as the paramount power. The state was strategically placed,",
  "at the extreme southern tip of the subcontinent. It had the most highly edu-",
  "cated populace in India, a thriving maritime trade, and newly discovered re-",
  "serves of monazite, from which is extracted thorium, used in the production",
  "of atomic energy and atomic bombs. The dewan of Travancore was Sir C. P.",
  "Ramaswamy Aiyar, a brilliant and ambitious lawyer who had been in his post",
  "for sixteen years. It was commonly believed that he was the real ruler of the",
  "state, whose maharaja and maharani were like putty in his hands.",
  "As early as February 1946 Sir C. P. had made clear his belief that, when",
  "theBritishleft,Travancorewouldbecomea\u2018perfectlyindependentunit\u2019,asit",
  "had been before 1795, when it first signed a treaty with the East India Com-",
  "pany.Inthe summer of1947heheld aseries ofpress conferences seeking the",
  "co-operation of the people of Travancore in his bid for independence. He re-",
  "mindedthemoftheantiquityoftheirrulingdynastyandofTravancore\u2019ssink-",
  "ing of a Dutch fleet back in the year 1741 (this apparently the only naval de-",
  "feat ever inflicted by an Asian state on a European power). This appeal to a",
  "past redolent in regional glory was meant to counter the pan-Indian national-",
  "ism of the present. For the Congress had a strong presence in the state, as did",
  "the Communist Party of India. Still, the dewan insisted that from 15 August",
  "1947\u2018Travancorewillbecomeanindependentcountry\u2019.\u2018Therewasnopartic-",
  "ular reason\u2019, he defiantly added, \u2018why she should be in a worse position than",
  "Denmark, Switzerland, and Siam.\u2019Interestingly, Travancore\u2019s bid for independence was welcomed by Mo-",
  "hammad Ali Jinnah. On 20 June he sent Sir C. P. a wire indicating that",
  "Pakistanwas\u2018readytoestablishrelationshipwithTravancorewhichwillbeof",
  "mutual advantage\u2019. Three weeks later the dewan wrote to the Madras govern-",
  "ment informing them that Travancore was taking steps to \u2018maintain herself as",
  "anindependententity\u2019.Itwas,however,readytosignatreatybetweenthe\u2018in-",
  "dependent Sovereign State\u2019 of Travancore and the \u2018Dominion Governments\u2019",
  "of both India and Pakistan.",
  "On 21 July the dewan of Travancore had an appointment to meet the",
  "viceroy in Delhi. The previous evening he met a senior British diplomat and",
  "told him that he hoped to get recognition from his government. If India re-",
  "fusedtosupplyTravancorewithtextiles,heasked,wouldtheUnitedKingdom",
  "step in? Sir C. P. had, it seems, been encouraged in his ambitions by politi-",
  "cians in London, who saw an independent Travancore as a source of a mater-",
  "ial crucial to the coming Cold War. In fact, the Travancore government had",
  "already signed an agreement with the UK government for the supply of mon-",
  "azite.InLondon,theministerofsupplyadvisedhisgovernmenttoavoidmak-",
  "ing any statement that would \u2018give the Indian Dominions leverage in com-",
  "bating Travancore\u2019s claim for independence\u2019. Since the state had the \u2018richest",
  "known deposit of monazite sand\u2019, said the minister, from the British point of",
  "view \u2018it would be an advantage if Travancore retained political and economic",
  "independence, at least for the time being.\u2019",
  "On the 21st Sir C. P. had his scheduled interview with Mountbatten.",
  "They were together for more than two hours, which time the dewan used to",
  "launch an excoriating attack on Gandhi, Nehru and the Congress. After he",
  "\u2018had worked off his emotional upset\u2019, the viceroy \u2018let him go and sent V. P.",
  "Menon to work on him\u2019. Menon urged him to sign the Instrument of Acces-",
  "sion, but the dewan said he would prefer to negotiate a treaty with India in-",
  "stead.",
  "Sir C. P. returned to Travancore, his mind still apparently firm on",
  "Independence. Then, while on his way to a music concert on 25 July, he was",

  "rajato\u2018followthepathofconciliationandcompromise\u2019whichhe,\u2018beingauto-cratic and over-decisive\u2019, had not himself followed. On 30 July the maharaja",
  "wired the viceroy of his decision to accede to the Indian Union.34",
  "A second state that wavered on the question of accession was Bhopal.",
  "This lay in central India, and had the not unusual combination of a mostly",
  "Hindu population and a Muslim ruler. Since 1944 the Nawab of Bhopal had",
  "served as chancellor of the Chamber of Princes. He was known to be a bit-",
  "ter opponent of the Congress, and correspondingly close to Jinnah and the",
  "Muslim League. When, after the war, the British made clear their intention to",
  "leave India, the prospect filled the Nawab with despair. He saw this as \u2018one",
  "of the greatest, if not the greatest, tragedies that has ever befallen mankind\u2019.",
  "Fornowthe\u2018States,theMoslems,andtheentiremassofpeoplewhoreliedon",
  "British justice . . . suddenly find themselves totally helpless, unorganised and",
  "unsupported\u2019. The only course left to the Nawab now was to \u2018die in the cause",
  "of the Moslems of the world\u2019.",
  "These lines are from a letter of November 1946, written to the political",
  "adviser to Lord Wavell. Four months later Wavell was replaced as viceroy by",
  "Mountbatten,who,asithappens,wasanoldpolo-playingbuddyoftheNawab",
  "of Bhopal. Their friendship went back twenty-five years; Mountbatten once",
  "claimed that the Nawab was his \u2018second-best friend in India\u2019.35 But it was",
  "soon clear that they now stood in different camps. In mid-July 1947 Mount-",
  "batten wrote to Bhopal, as he had to all other princes, advising him to accede",
  "to India. He got along and self-confessedly \u2018sentimental\u2019 letter in reply. This",
  "began by professing \u2018unbroken and loyal friendship\u2019 with the Crown of Eng-",
  "land; alinknowbeingbrokenbytheunilateral action ofHMG.Andtowhom",
  "had they delivered Bhopal and his colleagues? The hated party of Gandhi and",
  "Nehru.\u2018Arewe\u2019,askedBhopalangrily,\u2018towriteoutablankchequeandleave",
  "it to the leaders of the Congress Party to fill in the amount?\u2019",
  "From accusations of betrayal the letter then issued a warning. In India,",
  "said the Nawab, the main bulwarks against the \u2018rising tide of Communism\u2019",
  "were men of property. The Congress had already stated their intention to li-",
  "quidate landlords. To that party\u2019s left stood the Communist Party of India,",
  "which controlled the unions of transport workers; if they so chose, the com-",
  "munists could paralyse and starve the subcontinent. \u2018I tell you straight\u2019, said",
  "Bhopal to his friend, \u2018that unless you and His Majesty\u2019s Government support",
  "the States and prevent them from disappearing from the Indian political map,",
  "you will very shortly have an India dominated by Communists . . . If the Un-",
  "ited Nations one day find themselves with 450 million extra people under the",
  "heel of Communist domination they will be quite justified in blaming GreatBritain for this disaster, and I naturally would not like your name associated",
  "with it.\u2019",
  "Bhopal hinted that he, like Travancore, would declare his independence;",
  "inanycasehewouldnotattendthemeetingoftheChamberofPrincessched-",
  "uled for 25 July. On the 31st Mountbatten wrote back to Bhopal inviting him",
  "once more to sign the Instrument of Accession. He reminded him of what",
  "he had said in the speech: that no ruler could \u2018run away\u2019 from the dominion",
  "closesttohim.Andheshrewdlyturnedtheargumentaboutcommunismonits",
  "head. Yes, he told Bhopal, there was indeed a Red threat, but it would be best",
  "met if the Congress and the princes joined hands. For men like Patel were \u2018as",
  "frightened of communism as you yourself are. If only they had support from",
  "all other stable influences such as that of the Princely Order, it might be pos-",
  "sible for them to ward off the communist danger.\u201936",
  "By this time Bhopal had received reports of the meeting of 25 July. He",
  "had heard of the terrific impression his old friend had made, and also of the",
  "increasingtideofaccessionsbyhisfellowprinces.Andsohecapitulated,ask-",
  "ing only for a small sop to his pride. Would the viceroy press Patel to extend",
  "the deadline by ten days, so that his accession would be announced after 15",
  "August instead of before? That, said Bhopal, \u2018would enable me to sign our",
  "death warrant with a clear conscience\u2019. (In the event, Patel said he could not",
  "makeanyexceptions;insteadMount-battenofferedtoBhopalthatifhewould",
  "sign the Instrument of Accession on 14 August, he would keep it under lock",
  "and key and hand it over to Patel only after the 25th.)37",
  "A case more curious still was that of Jodhpur, an old and large state with",
  "a Hindu king as well as a largely Hindu population. At a lunch hosted by",
  "Mountbatteninmid-July,theyoungMaharajaofJodhpurhadjoinedtheother",
  "RajputprincesinindicatinghiswillingnesstoaccedetoIndia.Butsoonafter-",
  "wardssomeone\u2013itisnotclearwho\u2013plantedtheideainhisheadthatsincehis",
  "state bordered Pakistan, he might get better terms from that dominion. Poss-",
  "ibly at Bhopal\u2019s initiative, a meeting was arranged between him and Jinnah.",
  "At this meeting the Muslim League leader offered Jodhpur full port facilities",
  "in Karachi, unrestricted import of arms and supply of grain from Sindh to his",
  "own famine-stricken districts. In one version, Jinnah is said to have handed",
  "the maharaja a blank sheet and a fountain pen and said, \u2018You can fill in all",
  "your conditions.\u2019",
  "If Jodhpur had defected to Pakistan, this would have opened up the pos-",
  "sibility that states contiguous to it \u2013 such as Jaipur and Udaipur \u2013 would do",
  "likewise. However, K. M. Pannikar got wind of the plan and asked Vallab-",
  "hbhai Patel to intervene. Patel contacted Jodhpur and promised him free im-port of arms too, as well as adequate grain. Meanwhile, his own nobles and",
  "village headmen had told the maharaja that he could not really expect them",
  "to be at ease in a Muslim state. The ruler of an adjoining state, Jaisalmer,",
  "also asked him what would happen if he joined Pakistan and a riot broke out",
  "between Hindus and Muslims. Whose side would he then take?",
  "And so the Maharaja of Jodhpur also came round, but not before a last-",
  "minute theatrical show of defiance. When presented with the Instrument of",
  "Accessionintheanteroomoftheviceroy\u2019soffice,Jodhpurtookoutarevolver",
  "and held it to the secretary\u2019s head, saying, \u2018I will not accept your dictation.\u2019",
  "But in a few minutes he cooled down and signed on the line.38",
  "V",
  "Among the states that had not signed up by 15 August was Junagadh, which",
  "lay in the peninsula of Kathiawarin western India. This, like Bhopal, had a",
  "Muslim Nawab ruling over a chiefly Hindu population. On three sides Jun-",
  "agadhwassurroundedbyHindustatesorbyIndia,butonthefourth\u2013andthis",
  "distinguished it from Bhopal \u2013 it had a long coastline. Its main port, Verav-",
  "al, was 325 nautical miles from the Pakistani port city (and national capit-",
  "al) of Karachi. Junagadh\u2019s ruler in 1947, Mohabat Khan, had one abiding",
  "passion: dogs. His menagerie included 2,000 pedigree canines, including six-",
  "teen hounds specially deputed to guard the palace. When two of his favourite",
  "houndsmated, the Nawab announced apublic holiday.Ontheir \u2018marriage\u2019 he",
  "expended three lakh (300,000) rupees, or roughly a thousand times the aver-",
  "age annual income of one of his subjects.",
  "Within the borders of Junagadh lay the Hindu holy shrine of Somnath,",
  "as well as Girnar, a hill top with magnificent marble temples built by, and for,",
  "theJains.BothSomnathandGirnarattractedthousandsofpilgrimsfromother",
  "parts of India. The forests of Junagadh were also the last refuge of the Asiatic",
  "lion. These had been protected by Mohabat Khan and his forebears, who dis-",
  "couraged even high British officials from hunting them.39",
  "Inthesummerof1947theNawabofJunagadhwasonholidayinEurope.",
  "While he was away, the existing dewan was replaced by Sir Shah Nawaz",
  "Bhutto, a leading Muslim League politician from Sindh who had close ties",
  "to Jinnah.40 After the Nawab returned, Bhutt opressed him to stay out of the",
  "Indian Union. On 14 August, the day of the transfer of power, Junagadh an-",
  "nounced that it would accede to Pakistan. This it was legally allowed to do,althoughgeographicallyitmadelittlesense.ItalsoflewinthefaceofJinnah\u2019s",
  "\u2018two-nation\u2019 theory, since 82 per cent of Junagadh\u2019s population was Hindu.",
  "Pakistan sat on the Nawab\u2019s request for a few weeks, but on 13 Septem-",
  "ber it accepted the accession. It seems to have done this in the belief that it",
  "could then use Junagadh as a bargaining counter to secure Jammu and Kash-",
  "mir. That state too had not acceded to either dominion by 15 August. It had a",
  "Hindu maharaja and a majority Muslim population: in structural terms, it was",
  "a Junagadh in reverse.",
  "The acceptance by Pakistan of Junagadh\u2019s accession enraged the Indian",
  "leaders. Touched in a particularly \u2018tender spot\u2019 was Vallabhbhai Patel, who",
  "camefromthesameregionandspokethesamelanguage(Gujarati)astheres-",
  "idents of Junagadh.41 His first response was to secure the accession of two",
  "of Junagadh\u2019s tributary states, Mangrol and Babariawad. Their Hindu chiefs",
  "claimed that they had the right to join India; the Nawab of Junagadh denied",
  "this, claiming that as his vassals they had to seek his consent first. The Indian",
  "government went with the vassals, and sent in a small military force to sup-",
  "port them.",
  "In the middle of September V. P. Menon went to Junagadh to negotiate",
  "with the Nawab, but the ruler would not see him, feigning illness. Menon had",
  "tomakedowithmeetingthedewaninstead.HetoldSirShahNawazthatfrom",
  "both cultural and geographical points of view Junagadh really should join In-",
  "dia. Sir Shah Nawaz did not dispute this, but complained that local feelings",
  "hadbeeninflamedbythe\u2018virulentwritingsintheGujaratiPress\u2019.Hesaidthat",
  "he personally would favour the issue being decided by a referendum.42",
  "Meanwhile, a \u2018provisional government of Junagadh\u2019 was set up in Bom-",
  "bay. This was led by Samaldas Gandhi, a nephew of the Mahatma, and a nat-",
  "ive of the kingdom. This \u2018government\u2019 became the vehicle of popular agit-",
  "ation within Junagadh. In panic, the Nawab fled to Karachi, taking a dozen",
  "of his favourite dogs with him. The dewan was left holding the baby. On 27",
  "OctoberSirShahNawazwrotetoJinnahthat,while\u2018immediatelyafteracces-",
  "sion [to Pakistan], His Highness and myself received hundreds of messages",
  "chiefly from Muslims congratulating us on the decision, today our brethren",
  "are indifferent and cold. Muslims of Kathiawar seem to have lost all their en-",
  "thusiasm for Pakistan.\u2019",
  "Ten days later Sir Shah Nawaz informed the Indian government that he",
  "would like to hand over the administration of Junagadh. The formal transfer",
  "took place on 9 November. Back in Delhi, however, Mount-batten was cross",
  "that he had not been consulted before the territory was taken over. Partly to",
  "placate him, but also to establish its own legitimacy, the Indians then organ-ized a plebiscite. A referendum held on 20 February 1948 resulted in 91 per",
  "cent of the electorate voting for accession to India.43",
  "VI",
  "The state of Hyderabad also had a Muslim ruler and a mostly Hindu popu-",
  "lation; but it was a prize greater by far than Bhopal or Junagadh. The state",
  "ran right across the Deccan plateau, in the centre of the subcontinent. Its area",
  "wasinexcessof80,000squaremiles,anditspopulationmorethan16million,",
  "these distributed among three linguistic zones: Telugu, Kannada and Marathi.",
  "Hyderabad was surrounded by Central Provinces in the north, by Bombay",
  "in the west, and by Madras in the south and east. Although landlocked, it",
  "was self-sufficient in food, cotton, oilseed, coal and cement. Petrol and salt,",
  "however, had to be imported from British India.",
  "HyderabadbeganlifeasaMughalvassalstatein1713.Itsrulerwascon-",
  "ventionally known as the Nizam. Eighty-five per cent of its population was",
  "Hindu, but Muslims dominated the army, police and civil service. The Nizam",
  "himself owned about 10 per cent of the land of the state; much of the rest was",
  "controlled by large landowners. From his holdings the ruler earned Rs25 mil-",
  "lion a year in rent, while another Rs5 million were granted him from the state",
  "treasury. There were some very rich nobles, but the bulk of the Muslims, like",
  "the bulk of the Hindus, worked as factory hands, artisans, labourers and peas-",
  "ants.44",
  "In power in 1946\u20137 was the seventh Nizam, Mir Usman Ali, who had",
  "ascended to the throne as far back as 1911. He was one of the richest men in",
  "the world, but also one of the most miserly. He rarely wore new clothes, his",
  "preferred mode of dress being an un-ironed pyjama and shirt and a faded fez.",
  "He\u2018generallydroveinanold,rattling,tin-potofacar,a1918model;henever",
  "offered any kind of hospitality to a visitor\u2019.45",
  "ThisNizamwasdeterminedtohangontomorethanhispersonalwealth.",
  "What he wanted for his state, when the British left, was independence, with",
  "relations forged directly between him and the Crown. To help him with his",
  "case he had employed Sir Walter Monckton, a King\u2019s Counsel and one of the",
  "most highly regarded lawyers in England. (Among Monckton\u2019s previous cli-",
  "entswasKingEdwardVIII,whomhehadadvisedduringhisabdication.) For",
  "theEnglishman\u2019sservicestheNizamwaspreparedtopayapacket:asmuchas",
  "90,000 guineas a year, it was rumoured. In a meeting with the viceroy, Mon-ckton \u2018emphasized that His Exalted Highness would have great difficulty in",
  "taking any course likely to compromise his independent sovereignty\u2019. When",
  "MountbattensuggestedthatHyderabadshouldjointheConstituentAssembly,",
  "the Nizam\u2019s lawyer answered that if India pressed too hard his client might",
  "\u2018seriously consider the alternative of joining Pakistan\u2019.46",
  "The Nizam\u2019s ambitions, if realized, would virtually cut off the north of",
  "India from the south. And, as the constitutional expert Reginald Coupland",
  "pointed out, \u2018India could live if its Moslem limbs in the northwest and north-",
  "east were amputated, but could it live without its midriff?\u2019 Sardar Patel put it",
  "more directly, saying that an independent Hyderabad constituted a \u2018cancer in",
  "the belly of India\u2019.47",
  "In this face-off between the Nizam and the government of India, each",
  "side had a proxy of its own. The Indians had the Hyderabad State Congress,",
  "formedin1938,whichpressedhardforrepresentativegovernmentwithinthe",
  "state. The Nizam had the Ittihad-ul-Muslimeen, which wished to safeguard",
  "thepositionofMuslimsinadministrationandpolitics.Anotherimportantact-",
  "or was the Communist Party of India, which had a strong presence in the",
  "Telengana region of the state.",
  "In 1946\u20137 all three voices grew more strident. The State Congress de-",
  "manded that Hyderabad fall into line with the rest of India. Its leaders organ-",
  "ized street protests, and courted arrest. Simultaneously, the Ittihad was being",
  "radicalized by its new leader, Kasim Razvi, an Aligarh-trained lawyer and a",
  "passionate believer intheidea of\u2018Muslim pride\u2019.UnderRazvi theIttihad had",

  "distributed to land-hungry peasants. The insurrectionists first seized all hold-",
  "ings in excess of 500 acres, bringing the limit down successively to 200 and",
  "then 100 acres. They also abolished the institution of forced labour. In the",
  "districts of Nalgonda, Warangal and Karimnagar the communists ran what",

  "pact with the Indian Union\u2019.51The Nizam\u2019s ambitions were encouraged by the Conservative Party in",
  "Britain. Sir Walter Monckton was himself a prominent Tory and he had writ-",
  "ten to his party leaders to support his client\u2019s case. Monckton claimed the",
  "Congress practised a kind of \u2018power politics\u2019 that was an \u2018exact replica of",
  "those in which Hitler and Mussolini indulged\u2019. Since Mountbatten was hand-",
  "in-glove with Nehru and Patel, it was up to the Tories to \u2018see to it that if this",
  "shameful betrayal of our old friends and allies cannot be prevented, at least it",
  "does not go uncastigated before the conscience of the world\u2019.52",
  "To see the Nizam\u2019s Hyderabad as Poland and the Congress as the equi-",
  "valent to Hitler\u2019s Nazis boggles the imagination. Even Winston Churchill al-",
  "lowed himself to be persuaded of the analogy, perhaps because he had along",
  "standing dislike for Mahatma Gandhi. Speaking in the House of Commons,",
  "Churchill argued that the British had a \u2018personal obligation . . . not to allow a",
  "state,whichtheyhaddeclaredasovereignstate,tobestrangled,starvedoutor",
  "actuallyoverbornebyviolence\u2019.Theparty\u2019srisingstar,R.A.Butler,weighed",
  "in on Churchill\u2019s side, saying that Britain should press for the \u2018just claims of",
  "Hyderabad to remain independent\u2019.53",
  "The Nizam, and more so the Razakars, also drew sustenance from the",
  "support to their cause from Pakistan. Jinnah had gone so far as to tell Lord",
  "Mountbatten that if the Congress \u2018attempted to exert any pressure on Hydera-",
  "bad,everyMuslimthroughoutthewholeofIndia,yes,allthehundredmillion",
  "Muslims, would rise as one man to defend the oldest Muslim dynasty in In-",
  "dia\u2019.54",
  "The Nizam now said he would sign a treaty with India, but not an In-",
  "strument of Accession. In late November 1947 he agreed to sign a \u2018Stand",
  "still Agreement\u2019, under which the arrangements forged between Hyderabad",
  "and the British Raj would be continued with its successor government. This",
  "bought both parties time; the Nizam to reconsider his bid for independence,",
  "the Indians to find better ways of persuading him to accede.",
  "Under this agreement, the Nizam and the Indian government deputed",
  "agents to each other\u2019s territory. The Indian agent was K. M. Munshi, a trusted",
  "ally of Vallabhbhai Patel. In November the Nizam had appointed a new",
  "dewan, Mir Laik Ali, who was a wealthy businessman and a known Pakistan",
  "sympathizer. Laik Ali offered some Hindu representation in his government,",
  "but it was seen by the State Congress as a case of too little, too late. In any",
  "case, by now the real power had passed on to the Razakars and its leader,",
  "Kasim Razvi. By March 1948 the membership of the Ittihad had reached a",
  "million, with a tenth of these being trained in arms. Every Razakar had takenavow in the name of Allah to \u2018fight to the last to maintain the supremacy of",
  "Muslim power in the Deccan\u2019.55",
  "In April 1948 a correspondent of The Times of London visited Hydera-",

  "The Razakars saw the Delhi-Hyderabad battle in Hindu\u2013Muslim terms.",
  "The Congress, on the other hand, saw it as a clash between democracy and",
  "autocracy. In truth, it was a bit of both. Caught in the cross-fire were the cit-",
  "izens of Hyderabad, for whom the months after August 1947 were a time",
  "of deep insecurity.59 Some Hindus began fleeing to the adjoining districts of",
  "Madras. Meanwhile, Muslims from the Central Provinces were flocking to",
  "Hyderabad. Mostly illiterate, these Muslims had heard fearful reports of at-",
  "tacks on their co-religionists in Bengal and Punjab. But they did not seem to",
  "realize that in Hyderabad too they would be a minority. Perhaps, as an in-",
  "dependent observer put it, \u2018these emigrating Muslims have more trust in the",
  "Nizam\u2019s troops and Arabs to protect them than in the Union provincial ad-",
  "ministration\u2019. In turn, these CP Muslims were said to have thrown out Hin-",
  "dus from their houses in Hyderabad, aided by the Nizam\u2019s men. It was even",
  "claimed that there was a plan to make Muslims a majority in the state: appar-",

  "Through the spring and summer of 1948 the tension grew. There were",
  "allegations of gun-running from Pakistan to Hyderabad \u2013 in planes flown by",
  "British mercenaries \u2013 and of the import of arms from eastern Europe. Theprime minister of Madras wrote to Patel saying he found it difficult to cope",
  "with the flood of refugees from Hyderabad. K. M. Munshi sent lurid reports",
  "of the Nizam\u2019s perfidy, of his \u2018fixed idea\u2019 of independence, of his referring to",

  "gandabeingcarriedoutdayandnightthroughspeeches,Nizam\u2019sradio,news-",
  "papers, dramas etc., against the Indian Union\u2019.61",
  "For the moment, the Indians temporized. In June 1948 V. P. Menon and",
  "Laik Ali held a series of meetings in Delhi. Menon asked that the state intro-",
  "duce representative government, and promise a plebiscite on accession. Vari-",
  "ous exceptions were proposed to protect the Nizam\u2019s dignity; these included",
  "theretentionoftroops.Nonewasfoundacceptable.Meanwhile,therespected",
  "former dewan of Hyderabad, Sir Mirza Ismail, attempted to mediate. He ad-",
  "vised the Nizam not to take the Hyderabad case to the United Nations (which",
  "Laik Ali had threatened to do), to get himself out of the clutches of the Raza-",
  "kars and to accede to India. Hyderabad, he told His Exalted Highness, \u2018must",
  "realize the weakness of its own position\u2019.62",
  "On 21 June 1948 Lord Mountbatten resigned from office of governor",
  "general. Three days previously he had written to the Nizam urging him to",
  "compromise, and go down in history \u2018as the peace-maker of South India and",
  "as the Saviour of your State, your dynasty, and your people\u2019. If he stuck to",
  "his stand, however, he would \u2018incur the universal condemnation of thinking",
  "people\u2019.63 The Nizam chose not to listen. But, with Mountbatten gone, it be-",
  "came easier for Patel to take decisive action. On 13 September a contingent",
  "of Indian troops was sent into Hyderabad. In less than four days they had full",
  "controlofthestate.Thosekilledinthefightingincludedforty-twoIndiansol-",
  "diers and two thousand-odd Razakars.",
  "On the night of the 17th, the Nizam spoke on the radio, his speech very",

  "and advised his subjects to \u2018live in peace and harmony with the rest of the",
  "people in India\u2019. Six days later he made another broadcast, where he said that",
  "Razvi and his men had taken \u2018possession of the state\u2019 by \u2018Hitlerite\u2019 methods",
