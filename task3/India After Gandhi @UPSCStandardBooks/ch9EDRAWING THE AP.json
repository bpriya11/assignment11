  "afterwards, on 10 October 1947, he wrote to a colleague: \u2018I do believe that",
  "we should hurry up with the reorganization of linguistic provinces\u2019 . . . There",
  "may be an illusion for the time being that different languages stand for differ-",
  "ent cultures, but there is also the possibility[that with the creation] of linguistic",
  "provinces it may disappear. I shall write something [about it] if I get the time\u2019. . . I am not unaware that a class of people have been saying that linguistic",
  "provinces are wrong. In my opinion, this class delights in creating obstacles.1",
  "Jawaharlal Nehru was also appreciative of the linguistic diversity of In-",
  "dia. In an essay of 1937, he wrote that \u2018a living language is a throbbing, vital",
  "thing, ever changing, ever growing and mirroring the people who speak and",
  "write it\u2019. And \u2018our great provincial languages are no dialects or vernaculars,",
  "as the ignorant sometimes call them. They are ancient languages with a rich",
  "inheritance, each spoken by many millions of people, each tied up inextric-",
  "ably with the life and culture and ideas of the masses as well as the upper",
  "classes. It is axiomatic that the masses can only grow educationally and cul-",
  "turally through the medium of their own language.\u20192",
  "That was Nehru\u2019s view in 1937, but by 1947 he was having other",
  "thoughts. The country had just been divided on the basis of religion: would",
  "not dividing it further on the basis of language merely encourage the break-",
  "up of the Union? Why not keep intact the existing administrative units, such",
  "as Madras, which had within it communities of Tamil, Mala-yalam, Telugu,",
  "Kannada, Urdu and Konkani speakers, and Bombay, whose peoples spoke",
  "Marathi, Gujarati, Urdu, Sindhi, Gondi and other tongues? Would not such",
  "multilingual and multicultural states provide an exemplary training in harmo-",
  "niousliving?Inanycase,shouldnotthenewnationuniteonthesecularideals",
  "of peace, stability and economic development, rather than revive primordial",
  "identities of caste and language?",
  "Nehru gave voice to these reservations in a speech to the Constituent",
  "Assembly three months after Independence. While the Congress had once",
  "promised linguistic provinces, he said, the country now faced \u2018a very critical",
  "situation resulting from partition\u2019. Now \u2018disruptionist tendencies had come to",
  "the fore\u2019; to check them, one had to underline \u2018the security and stability of",
  "India . . . The first essential therefore is for India as a whole to be strong",
  "and firmly established, confident in her capacity to meet all possible dangers",
  "and face and meet all problems. If India lives, all parts of India also live and",
  "prosper. If India is enfeebled, all her component elements grow weak.\u20193",
  "The creation of linguistic provinces, then, had to be deferred until such",
  "time as India was strong and sure of herself. Nehru seems to have persuaded",
  "even Gandhi of this, for in November 1947 the Mahatma was writing that",
  "\u2018the reluctance to enforce linguistic redistribution is perhaps justifiable in the",
  "presentdepressingatmosphere.Theexclusivespiritiseveruppermost.Noone",
  "thinks of the whole of India.\u2019 Gandhi now thought that the reorganization of",

  "died out and been replaced by \u2018a healthy atmosphere, promoting concord intheplaceofdiscord,peaceintheplaceofstrife,progressintheplaceofretro-",
  "gression and life in the place of death.\u20194",
  "As ever, Gandhi extolled the need to take \u2018one step at a time\u2019. But the",
  "principle itself he would not surrender. In a prayer meeting held on 25 Janu-",
  "ary 1948 Gandhi returned to the subject of linguistic states. \u2018The Congress",
  "had decided some twenty years ago\u2019, he recalled, \u2018that there should be as",
  "many provinces in the country as there are major languages.\u2019 Now it was in",
  "power, and in a position to execute that promise. Gandhi thought that if new",
  "provinces were formed on the basis of language, and if",
  "they are all placed under the authority of Delhi there is no harm at all.",
  "But it will be very bad if they all want to be free and refuse to accept",
  "central authority. It should not be that Bombay then will have nothing",
  "to do with Maharashtra and Maharashtra with Karnataka and Karnataka",
  "with Andhra. Let all live as brothers. Moreover if linguistic provinces",
  "are formed it will also give a fillip to the regional languages. It would be",
  "absurd to make Hindusthani the medium of instruction in all the regions",
  "and it is still more absurd to use English for this purpose.5",
  "Within a week Gandhi was dead. And the men in power had other, and",
  "more urgent, matters to attend to. Millions of refugees from East and West",
  "Pakistan had to be found homes and gainful employment. An undeclared war",
  "wastakingplaceinKashmir.Anewconstitutionhadtobedecidedupon.Elec-",
  "tions had to be scheduled, economic policies framed and executed. For now,",
  "and perhaps indefinitely, the creation of new provinces had to wait.",
  "Nehru\u2019s reluctance to superimpose divisions of language on the recent",
  "division by religion had the support of both Vallabhbhai Patel and C. Rajago-",
  "palachari.Thelatterinsistedthat\u2018furtherfissiparousforces\u2019hadtobechecked",

  "[they] cannot be supported.\u20197",
  "This verdict caused dismay among large sections of the Assembly. For",

  "harashtra, which sought to bring together Marathi speakers in a single polit-",
  "ical unit. The Malayalis wanted a state of their own, based on the merger of",
  "the princely states of Cochin and Travancore with Malabar. There was also a",
  "Mahagujarat movement.",
  "In a class of its own was the struggle for a Sikh state in the Punjab. This",
  "brought together claims of language as well as religion. The Sikhs had been",
  "perhaps the main sufferers of Partition. They had lost their most productive",

  "Circa 1950 the Hindus comprised roughly 62 per cent of the population",
  "of the Indian Punjab, with Sikhs being about 35 per cent. However, these fig-",
  "ures marked a major regional divide. The eastern half of the province was achiefly Hindi-speaking region, with Hindus comprising about 88 per cent of",
  "the population. The western half was a Punjabi-speaking region, with Sikhs",
  "constituting a little over half the population.",
  "The division by religion did not perfectly map division by language.",
  "Where all Sikhs had Punjabi as their first language, so did many Hindus.",
  "However, the Hindus were prone to view Punjabi as merely a local dialect of",
  "Hindi, whereas the Sikhs insisted it was not just a language in its own right,",

  "whose alphabet they believed to have come from the mouth of the Guru.9",
  "Since the 1920s the interests of the politically conscious Sikhs had been",
  "represented by the Akali Dal. This was both a religious body and a politic-",
  "al party. It controlled the Sikh shrines, or gurdwaras, but also contested elec-",
  "tions. The long-time leader of the Akali Dal was a man named Master Tara",

  "In the 1920s Tara Singh joined the movement to rid the Sikh shrines of",
  "the decadent priests who then ran them. In 1931 he became the head of the",
  "Shiromani Gurdwara Prabandhak Committee, a post with vast authority and",
  "influence, not least over money. For the next thirty years he was the most res-",

  "Not all Sikhs were behind Tara Singh, however. The low-caste Sikhs,",
  "who feared the Jats, were opposed to the Akali Dal. Some Jats had joined",
  "the Congress. And in a tendentious move, many Punjabi-speaking Hindus re-",
  "turned Hindi as their mother tongue in the 1951 census.",
  "But the biggest blow to Tara Singh was the general election itself. In the",
  "Punjab Assembly, which had 126 seats, the Akalis won a mere 14.",

  "Without question the most vigorous movement for linguistic autonomy was",
  "thatoftheTeluguspeakersoftheAndhracountry.Teluguwasspokenbymore",
  "people in India than any other language besides Hindi. It had a rich literary",
  "history, and was associated with such symbols of Andhra glory as the Vijay-",

  "abhahadworkedhardtocultivateasenseofidentityamongtheTelugu-speak-",
  "ing peoples of the Madras presidency whom, they argued, had been discrim-",
  "inated against by the Tamils. The Mahasabha was also active in the princely",
  "state of Hyderabad.",
  "After Independence the speakers of Telugu asked the Congress to imple-",
  "ment its old resolutions in favour of linguistic states. The methods they used",
  "to advance their case were various: petitions, representations, street marches",
  "and fasts. In a major blow to the Congress, the former Madras Chief Minister",
  "T.Prakasamresignedfromthepartyin1950ontheissueofstatehood.Cutting",
  "across party lines, the Telugu-speaking legislators in the Madras Assembly",
  "urged the immediate creation of a state to be named Andhra Pradesh. In the",
  "monsoonof1951aCongress-politician-turned-swaminamedSitaramwentonhunger strike in support. After five weeks the fast was given up, in response",
  "to an appeal by the respected Gandhian leader Vinoba Bhave.13",
  "The case for Andhra was now put to the test of universal adult suffrage.",
  "During his campaign tour in the Telugu-speaking districts, Jawaharlal Nehru",
  "was met at several places by protesters waving black flags and shouting \u2018We",
  "want Andhra\u2019.14 The official party paper wrote in dismay that \u2018the Congress",
  "President witnessed demonstrations by protagonists of an Andhra State, with",
  "slogans, placards and posters. At some place she smiled at them, at others",
  "he was enraged by their behaviour.\u201915 The signs were ominous, and indeed",
  "despite its successes elsewhere the Congress did very poorly here. Of the",
  "145 seats from the region in the Madras Legislative Assembly, the party won",
  "a mere 43. The bulk of the other seats were won by parties supporting the",
  "Andhramovement.Theseincludedthecommunists,whoreturnedanimpress-",

  "The election results encouraged the revival of the Andhra movement.",
  "TowardstheendofFebruary1952SwamiSitaram beganamarchthroughthe",

  "On22MayNehrutoldParliamenthow\u2018forsomeyearsnowourforemost",

  "look upon anything that did not help this process of consolidation as undesir-",
  "able. Even though the formation of linguistic provinces may be desirable in",
  "some cases, this would obviously be the wrong time. When the right time",
  "comes, let us have them by all means.\u2019",
  "As K. V. Narayana Rao has written, \u2018this attitude of Nehru appeared too",
  "vague and evasive to the Andhras. Nobody knew what the right time was and",
  "when it would come.\u2019 Impatient for an answer, the Andhras intensified their",
  "protest. On 19 October 1952 a man named Potti Sriramulu began a fast-unto-death in Madras. He had the blessings of Swami Sitaram, and of thousands of",
  "other Telugu speakers besides.18",
  "Born in Madras in 1901, Sriramulu had studied sanitary engineering be-",
  "fore taking a job in the railways. In 1928 he suffered a double tragedy when",
  "his wife died along with their newly born child. Two years later he resigned",
  "his post to join the salt satyagraha. Later he spent some time at Gandhi\u2019s",
  "Sabarmati ashram. Later still he spent eighteen months in jail as part of the",
  "individual satyagraha campaign of 1940\u20131.",
  "Ahagiographicstudypublishedin1985bytheCommitteeforHistoryof",
  "Andhra Movement claimed that Potti Sriramulu\u2019s stay at Mahatma Gandhi\u2019s",
  "ashram \u2018was epoch-making. For here was a seeker full of love and humility,",
  "all service and all sacrifice for his fellow-humanity; and here also was a guru,",
  "the world-teacher, equally full of affection, truth, ahimsa and kinship with",
  "daridra narayana or the suffering poor. While at Sabarmati, [Sriramulu] . . .",
  "did histasks with cheer and devotion, and won the affection of the intimates",
  "and the approbation of the Kulapati [Gandhi].\u201919",
  "GandhididregardSriramuluwithaffectionbutalso,itmustbesaid,with",
  "a certain exasperation. On 25 November 1946 the disciple had begun a fast-",
  "unto-death to demand the opening of all temples in Madras province to Un-",
  "touchables. Other Congress representatives, their minds more focused on the",
  "impending freedom of India, urged him to desist. When he refused they ap-",
  "proached Gandhi,whopersuaded himtoabandonthefast.TheMahatma then",
  "wrote to T. Prakasam that he was \u2018glad that the fast of Sreeramulu ended in",
  "the happy manner you describe. He had sent me a telegram immediately he",
  "broke his fast. I know he is a solid worker, though a little eccentric.\u201920",
  "That fast of 1946 Potti Sriramulu had called off at Gandhi\u2019s insistence;",
  "but in 1952 the Mahatma was dead. In any case, Andhra meant more to Sri-",
  "ramulu than the Untouchables once had. This fast he would carry out till the",
  "end, or until the government of India relented.",
  "On 3 December Nehru wrote to Rajagopalachari: \u2018Some kind of fast is",
  "going on for the Andhra Province and I get frantic telegrams. I am totally un-",
  "moved by this and I propose to ignore it completely. By this time Sriramulu",

  "Nehru was now forced to recognize the force of popular sentiment. On",
  "12 December he wrote again to Rajaji, suggesting that the time had come to",
  "accept the Andhra demand. \u2018Otherwise complete frustration will grow amongthe Andhras, and we will not be able to catch up with it. Two days later Ra-",

  "starts from this focus, as the Andhra boys are highly emotional and prone to",

  "probably the mischief may dwindle away.\u201922",

  "Over the course of the next few months the Telugu districts of Madras",

  "the chief minister, was \u2018accompanied by a lot of bad language, bad behaviour",
  "and distrust and anger\u2019.24 Suppressing his feelings, Rajagopalachari attended",

  "The Bombay Citizens Committee had a one-point agenda \u2013 to keep the",

  "Maharashtrians. Even among the working class, Marathi speakers were often",

  "Behind the veneer of cosmopolitanism there was one language group",
  "that dominated the \u2018save Bombay\u2019 movement: the Gujaratis. If Bombay be-",

  "as early as 1946 there was a Samyukta Maharashtra Parishad in operation.",
  "Within its ranks were Maharashtrians of all political persuasions, left and",
  "right, secular and communal, Brahmin, Maratha and Harijan. The Parishad",
  "sought a state that would unite Marathi speakers dispersed across many dif-",
  "ferent political units. In their minds, however, there was no doubt that such a",
  "state could have only one capital: Bombay.",
  "The president of the Samyukta Maharashtra Parishad was the veteran",
  "Congress man Shankarrao Deo, while its secretary and chief theoretician was",
  "thecelebratedCambridge-educatedeconomistD.R.Gadgil.InGadgil\u2019sopin-",
  "ion,whileBombaycouldstillbethemajorportandeconomiccentreofMaha-",
  "rashtra, there must be a \u2018compulsory decentralization\u2019 of the city\u2019s industries.",
  "Another ideologue, G. V. Deshmukh, was more blunt. Unless Bombay city",
  "became part of their state, he said, Maharashtrians would have to remain con-",
  "tent with \u2018playing the part of secondary brokers to brokers, secondary agents",
  "toagents,assistantprofessorstoprofessors,clerkstomanagers[and]hiredla-",
  "bourers to shopkeepers\u2019.30To answer the Citizens Committee of the Gujaratis, the Samyukta Ma-",
  "harashtra Parishad prepared an impressive 200-page document of its own.",
  "The first part mounted a theoretical defence of the principle of linguistic",
  "states. These, it argued, would deepen federalism by bringing together speak-",
  "ersofthesamelanguageinoneconsolidated,cohesiveunit.Thus,\u2018alinguistic",
  "provincewithitsadministrationinthelanguageofthecommonpeople,would",
  "make it possible for the people to feel and understand the working of demo-",
  "cracy and the need to participate in it\u2019.",
  "Coming specifically to their own state, the document claimed that \u2018soci-",
  "ety all over the Marathi country is remarkably homogeneous\u2019. There was the",
  "same configuration of castes, the same deities and saints, the same folklore",
  "and legends. That the Marathi speakers were presently spread out over three",
  "political units \u2013 Hyderabad, Bombay state, and the Central Provinces \u2013 was",
  "an accident of history that needed urgently to be undone.",
  "AnewandunifiedstateofMaharashtrahadtobecreated,arguedthePar-",
  "ishad, with Bombay as its capital. For the land on which this island city stood",
  "had long been inhabited by speakers of the Marathi language. While the sea",
  "lay to Bombay\u2019s west, the territory to its north, south and east was dominated",
  "by Marathi speakers. The city itself was the main centre of the Marathi press,",
  "of publications in the Marathi language and of Marathi culture. Economic-",
  "ally, Bombay depended heavily on its Marathi hinterland, from where it drew",
  "much of its labour and all its water and power. Its ways of communication all",
  "lay through Maharashtra. In sum, it was \u2018unthinkable to form a State of Ma-",
  "harashtra which has not Bombay as its capital and it would render impossible",
  "theworkingofaStateofMaharashtra,ifanyattemptwasmadetoseparatethe",
  "cityofBombayfromit\u2019.TotheargumentthatthecitydidnothaveaMarathi-",

  "ing this language than any other. In any case, it was in the nature of great port",
  "citiestobemultilingual.InBurma\u2019scapital,only32percentofthepopulation",
  "spoke the national language, but \u2018nobody yet dared to suggest that Rangoon",
  "should be considered as non-Burmese territory\u2019.31",
  "Bombay was surrounded by Marathi-speaking districts; it must be the",
  "capital of a new state of Maharashtra. So argued the Samyukta Maharashtra",
  "Parishad.ButtheCitizensCommitteeclaimedthatBombayhadbeennurtured",
  "mostlybynon-Maharashtrians,andmustthereforebeconstitutedasaseparate",
  "city-state. Could the two sides ever agree? In June 1954 Shankarrao Deo vis-",
  "ited Sir Purushottamdas Thakurdasto discuss a compromise. Deo said that",
  "there was no negotiation possible on their core demand \u2013 Bombay as capital",
  "of Maharashtra \u2013 but said that they could work together to retain \u2018the sameautonomous character of the metropolitan city, ensuring its cosmopolitan",
  "life; its trade, commerce and industry, etc.\u2019. Sir Purushottamdas, for his part,",
  "was willing to give up the city-state idea in favour of a composite bilingual",
  "province of Marathi and Gujarati speakers.32",
  "The meeting was civil, but inconclusive. The matter of Bombay was re-",
  "ferred to the States Reorganization Commission, the hottest of the many hot",
  "potatoes it became their misfortune to handle.",
  "V",
  "The members of the StatesReorganization Commission were ajurist, S. Fazl",
  "Ali, a historian and civil servant, K. M. Pannikar, and a social worker, H. N.",
  "Kunzru.Notably,nonehadanyformalties,pastorpresent,withtheCongress.",
  "After eighteen months of intensive work, the trio submitted their report in",
  "October1955.Thereportfirstcarefullyoutlinedtheargumentsforandagainst",
  "linguistic states. It urged a \u2018balanced approach\u2019 which recognized \u2018linguistic",
  "homogeneity as an important factor conducive to administrative convenience",
  "and efficiency\u2019 yet not \u2018as an exclusive and binding principle, over-riding all",
  "other considerations\u2019. Among these other considerations were, of course, the",
  "unity and security of India asawhole.33",
  "Next,innineteenchapters,thereportoutlinedtheirspecificproposalsfor",
  "reorganization. With respect to the southern states, it seemed easy enough to",
  "redistribute areas according to the major language zones: Telugu, Kannada,",
  "Tamil and Malayalam. Districts and taluks (sub-districts) were reallocated",
  "with regard to which linguistic group was in a majority. Four compact states",
  "would replace the melange of territories deriving from the British period.",
  "With regard to north India, the SRC likewise sought to divide the huge",
  "Hindi-speaking belt into four states: Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh",
  "and Rajasthan. In the east, the existing provinces would stay as they were,",
  "withminoradjustments.TheCommissionrejectedthedemandfortribalstates",
  "to be carved out of Bihar and Assam.",
  "TheSRCdidnotagreetothecreationofaSikhstate.Anditrefusedtoal-",

  "\u2018not lightly brush aside the fears of the other communities\u2019.",
  "VI",
  "The SRC\u2019s recommendation that Bombay be the capital of a bilingual state",
  "wasdiscussedinParliamenton15November1955.TheambitiousBombayMP",
  "S. K. Patil thought the Commission should have gone further. He thought",
  "the government should create a city-state of Bombay; no doubt hoping that it",
  "might come to be managed by himself. The prospective city-state, he argued,",
  "had a \u2018cosmopolitan population in every respect\u2019; it had been \u2018built upon the",
  "labour of everybody\u2019. If left to govern itself, Bombay would \u2018be a miniature",
  "India run on international standards\u2019 . . . [A] melting pot which will evolve a",
  "glorious new civilisation . . . And it is an extraordinary coincidence that the",
  "population of the city should be exactly one per cent of the population of the",
  "whole country. This one per cent drawn from all parts of the country will set",
  "the pace for other states in the practice of secularism and mutual understand-",
  "ing.\u2019",
  "Patil,liketheSRCitself,askedtheMaharashtrianstogiveuptheirclaim",
  "on Bombay in the spirit of compromise. But it soon became clear that he",
  "did not speak for his fellow Maharashtrians. Speaking immediately after Patil",
  "in the Lok Sabha was the Congress MP from the city of Pun\u00e9, N.V. Gadgil.",
  "Gadgil insisted that while he was in favour of compromise, \u2018there is a limit.",
  "That limit is,nobodycancompromise one\u2019sself-respect, nowomancancom-",

  "ukta Maharashtra with the city of Bombay as capital will not be acceptable\u2019.",
  "Ifthesesentimentswentunheeded,warnedGadgil,thenthefutureofBombay",
  "would be decided on the streets of Bombay.",
  "The SRC urged the Maharashtrians to accept the loss of Bombay in the",
  "name of national unity. Gadgil protested against this attempt at blackmail.",
  "The last 150 years, he said, had seen Maharashtrians contributing selflessly",
  "to the growth of national feeling. Marathi speakers founded the first Indian",
  "schools and universities, and helped found the Indian National Congress. The",
  "Mahrattas were \u2018the pioneers of violent action\u2019 against the British. Later, inthe early twentieth century, when the Congress Party languished, \u2018who was",
  "it that brought in new life? Who propounded the new tenets and new philo-",
  "sophy? It was Lokmanya Tilak. In the Home Rule movement he led and in",
  "the 1920 movement we were behind none and ahead of many provinces . . . I",

  "Gandhi that Maharashtra is the beehive of [national] workers. Even now, in",
  "independent India, it was a Maharashtrian, Vinoba Bhave, who was \u2018carry-",
  "ing the flag of Gandhian philosophy and spreading his message from place to",
  "place\u2019.",
  "In the matter of Bombay, the Maharashtrians were being lectured on the",
  "need to \u2018work for the unity and safety and good of the country\u2019. But,said the",
  "Pun\u00e9 MP bitterly, all these years \u2018we have done nothing else\u2019. Gadgil\u2019s was",
  "a moving peroration \u2013 and the last line was the best: \u2018To ask us to serve the",
  "nation is to ask chandan [sandalwood] to be fragrant.\u201934",
  "The matter now shifted, as Gadgil had warned, from the chamber to the",
  "streets.These,asoneBombayweeklywarned,were\u2018literallyseethingwithan",
  "unrest that may possibly erupt into something terrifyingly coercive, making",
  "ordered life impossible for some time to come\u2019.35 The discontent was being",

  "This capacious inclusiveness was reflected in an amended name: the",

  "iti.36 \u2018Parishad\u2019 is best translated as \u2018organization\u2019, thus implying the central",

  "and participatory endeavour.",
  "Fearing trouble, in the early hours of 16 January the Bombay police",
  "swooped down on the leaders and activists of the newly constituted All-Party",
  "Action Committee for Samyukta Maharashtra. They made nearly 400 arrests",
  "in all. This prompted a call for a general strike on the 18th. That day shops",
  "and factories were closed, and buses and trains didn\u2019t run. Processions were",
  "madethroughthestreets,burningeffigiesofNehruandoftheGujarati-speak-",

  "still and 15,000 policemen were called out to battle the rioters. When the",
  "smoke lifted, there were more than a dozen people dead, and property worth",
  "billions of rupees destroyed. It had been the worst riot in living memory.38",
  "Jawaharlal Nehru was deeply shaken by the events in Bombay. The lin-",
  "guistic question, he wrote to a colleague, \u2018is more serious than even the situ-",
  "ation created by the Partition and we have to give a positive lead\u2019.39 Meeting",
  "in Amritsar in the third week of January, the All-India Congress Committee",
  "deplored the violence by which \u2018Bombay and India were disgraced and dis-",
  "honoured\u2019. Under Nehru\u2019s direction, the party urged its members to discour-",
  "ageforcesof\u2018disruption,separatism andprovincialism\u2019, andinsteadworkfor",
  "\u2018the integration of all parts of this great country\u2019. The Congress chief min-",

  "tendencies\u2019, aid economic progress and, above all, be \u2018a significant example",
  "of that positive approach to the problem of Indian unity\u2019 that the party bosses",
  "had called for.40",
  "Among Nehru\u2019s allies were the home minister, G. B. Pant, and his",
  "fellow-in-effigyMorarjiDesai.Theintentionoftheprotesters,saidDesai,was",
  "to \u2018overturn Government practically and to take possession of the City by",
  "force. It was also their purpose in overawing the non-Maharashtrian elements",
  "in the City into submission and into agreeing that Bombay City should go to",
  "Maharashtra.\u2019",
  "This interpretation was vigorously contested by N. V. Gadgil. He be-",
  "lieved the administration had overreacted. Gadgil wrote to both Nehru and",
  "Pant of how the firing and lathi-charges by the police had been \u2018on ascale",
  "whichwillmakeeventheex-BritishofficialsinEnglandblush\u2019.Backin1919",
  "the British had termed a peaceful meeting in Amritsar\u2019s Jallianawala Bagh a",
  "\u2018rebellion against the government\u2019, to justify the slaughter by General Dyer.",
  "In the same way, Morarji Desai had now exaggerated the protests in Bom-",

  "that \u2018one who shoots is a good administrator\u2019. But the costs to the party were",
  "huge. For \u2018in Bombay indiscriminate firing by the police and other atrocities",

  "Mumbai dya\u2019 (Uncle Nehru, hand over Bombay). Nehru came, but amid tight",

  "Nehru\u2019s problems were compounded by the now open disaffection",
  "among the Maharashtrian section of the Congress Party. The Union\u2019s finance",
  "minister C. D. Deshmukh, MP for the coastal district of Kulaba, resigned in",

  "vailing climate this was deemed unfeasible. On 1 November the new states",
  "based on language came into being. Joining them was a bilingual state of",
  "Bombay. The only concession to the protesters was the replacement of Mor-",
  "arji Desai as chief minister by the 41-year-old Maratha Y. B. Chavan.44",

  "guage.45 But once Nehru conceded Andhra, and set up the States Reorganiza-tion Commission, it was inevitable that the country as a whole would be reor-",
  "ganized on the basis of language.",
  "The movements for linguistic states revealed an extraordinary depth of",
  "popular feeling. For Kannadigas and for Andhras, for Oriyas as for Maha-",
  "rashtrians, language proved a more powerful marker of identity than caste or",
  "religion. This was manifest in their struggles, and in their behaviour when the",
  "struggle was won.",
  "One sign of this was official patronage of the arts. Thus great effort, and",
  "cash, went into funding books, plays and films written or performed in the",
  "official language of the state. Much rubbish was funded as a result, but also",
  "much work of worth. In particular, the regional literatures have flourished",
  "since linguistic reorganization.",

  "High Court, a fine columned building in red which remains perhaps the city\u2019s",
  "prettiest structure. However, the Mysore chief minister, Kengal Hanuman-",
  "thaiya, saw the High Court as a colonial excrescence. He first sought permis-",

  "Souda would dwarf and tame it. It had to convey an \u2018idea of power and dig-",
