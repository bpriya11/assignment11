  "O 27 May 1964, as the news of Jawaharlal Nehru\u2019s death",
  "N THE AFTERNOON OF",
  "spread through New Delhi, one of the people it reached was an American",
  "graduate student named Granville Austin. Austin was writing a thesis on the",
  "making of the Indian Constitution, and thus had a more than ordinary interest",
  "inwhatNehrustoodfor.HemadehiswaytoTeenMurtiHouse,theretojoinan",
  "already large crowd of Indian mourners. As Austin wrote in his diary the next",
  "day,\u2018allwantedtogoin,buttheywerepreparedtowait\u2019.Thecrowdstood,\u2018or-",
  "derly and not noisy\u2019, as diplomats and ministers were ushered in by the prime",
  "minister\u2019s staff. Among the VIPs was Dr Syed Mahmud, a veteran freedom",
  "fighter who had been with Nehru at Cambridge and in jail. Like the others, he",
  "hadtodisembarkfromhiscarandwalkupthesteeplyslopinglawnthatfronted",
  "the prime minister\u2019s residence. Austin saw a weeping Mahmud given a help-",
  "inghandbyJagjivanRam,aseniorCongresspoliticianandCabinetministerof",
  "low-caste origin. This was truly \u2018a scene symbolic of Nehru\u2019s India: a Muslim",
  "aided by an Untouchable coming to the home of a caste Hindu\u2019.1",
  "Between them, Muslims and Untouchables constituted a quarter of the",
  "population in free India. Before 1947, two leaders had most seriously chal-",
  "lenged the Congress\u2019s claims to represent all of India. One was a Muslim, M.",
  "A.Jinnah,whoarguedthatthepartyofGandhiandNehrurepresentedonlythe",
  "Hindus. The other was a former Untouchable, B. R. Ambedkar, who added the",
  "devastating rider that the Congress did not represent all Hindus, but only the",
  "upper castes among them.",
  "These claims were stoutly resisted. Gandhi himself had struggled against",
  "untouchability from long before Ambedkar had entered politics. And he had",
  "givenhislifeinthecauseofHindu\u2014Muslimharmony.FortheMahatma,swa-",
  "raj (freedom) would have meaning only if it came to all Indians, regardless of",
  "caste or creed (or gender).ThesewerecommitmentsJawaharlalNehrusharedwithGandhi.Inother",
  "matters, he might have been a somewhat wayward disciple. With his fellow",
  "intellectualshechosetotakeIndiadowntheroadofindustrialmodernization,",
  "rather than nurture a village-centred economy (as Gandhi would have",
  "wanted). But when it came to preserving the rights of minorities he stood",
  "shoulder-to-shoulder with the Mahatma. His was likewise a nationalism that",
  "was both composite as well as egalitarian.",
  "Inspired by Gandhi, and guided by Nehru, the Indian Constitution both",
  "abolished untouchability and proclaimed the state neutral in matters of reli-",
  "gion. Such was the law; how was the practice? Among all the tests faced by",
  "the new state this, perhaps, was the sternest. Since Hindus were both in a nu-",
  "merical majority and in positions of political pre-eminence, the idea of India",
  "would stand scrutiny only if they respected the rights and liberties of Indians",
  "different from themselves.",
  "II",
  "The idea of Pakistan had as its justification the need for minorities to be free",
  "of the fear of Hindu domination. Paradoxically, though, the state of Pakistan",
  "was created out of Muslim majority areas where this problem did not exist in",
  "the first place.",
  "After 1947 there were large populations of Muslims scattered all over",
  "peninsular India \u2013 as they had been before that date. Several million Muslims",
  "migrated across the borders to East and West Pakistan, but many more than",
  "this elected to stay behind in India. The creation of Pakistan had made their",
  "positiondeeplyvulnerable.Thiswastheview,ironically,oftwomenwhohad",
  "played critical roles in the making of Pakistan: the Bengali Muslim Leaguer",
  "H. S. Suhrawardy and his United Provinces counterpart Chaudhry Khali-",

  "Partition\u2013SuhrawardywrotetoKhaliquzzamaninhorrorthat\u2018theMuslimsin",
  "the Indian Union have been left high and dry\u2019. The antagonism caused by the",
  "formation of Pakistan had been heightened by the flight into India of Hindu",
  "and Sikh refugees. Suhrawardy now feared that \u2018there may be a general con-",
  "flagration which can well destroy the Muslim minority in the Indian Union\u2019.",
  "As for Khaliquzzaman, he had reached the melancholy conclusion that \u2018the",
  "partition of India [had] proved positively injurious to the Muslims of India,",
  "and on along-term basis for Muslims everywhere\u2019.To protect their interests and their lives \u2013 Suhrawardy drafted \u2018a de-",
  "claration of co-operation and mutual assistance between the two Dominions\u2019,",
  "committing both to protecting their minorities and to not making provocative",
  "statements against each other. Suhrawardy got Gandhi to endorse the declara-",
  "tion, but failed to get Jinnah to consent, despite begging him to doso, \u2018forthe",
  "sake of the helpless and hapless Muslims of the Indian Union\u2019.2",
  "Aswehaveseen,thecreationofPakistanprovidedafilliptotheforcesof",
  "Hindu communalism. The RSS and its ilk could now argue that the Muslims",
  "werebetrayerswhohaddividedthenation.IntheviewoftheextremistHindu,",
  "these Muslims should either go to Pakistan or face the consequences. The",
  "RSS grew in strength immediately after Partition, and although the murder of",
  "Gandhi in January 1948 stemmed its rise, the organization continued to exer-",
  "cise considerable influence in northern and western India.",
  "Truth be told, there were chauvinists within the ruling Congress itself,",
  "men who were not completely convinced of the loyalty of Muslims to the",
  "new nation. Some were in positions of high authority. The governor of Bihar",
  "warned the owners of the great steel mill in Jamshed-pur that their Muslim",
  "employees would leave for Pakistan, but destroy the machinery before going.",

  "ers stayed steadfast, issuing a notice that they had no intention of dismissing",

  "force.3",
  "The deep insecurity of the Indian Muslim was foregrounded in a survey",
  "conducted by an American psychologist in 1950. His Muslim interviewees \u2013",
  "who were from towns in north and west India \u2013 were beset by fear and suspi-",
  "cion. \u2018We are regarded as Pakistani spies\u2019, said one. \u2018It is dangerous to live in",

  "III",
  "Among those who did not wholly trust the Muslims was Vallabhbhai Patel,",
  "Home Minister of India. Patel remembered that the majority of Muslims had",
  "voted for the League in 1946, even in areas which would not form part of",
  "Pakistan. After the two states were created he remained suspicious of those",
  "who had stayed behind. In a speech at Lucknow in early January 1948 he re-minded his audience that it was in that town that \u2018the foundation of the two-",
  "nation theory was laid\u2019. For it was the UP intellectuals who had claimed that",
  "\u2018Muslimswereaseparatenation\u2019.Now,forthosewhohadchosennottogoto",
  "Pakistan, it was not enough to give \u2019mere declarations of loyalty to the Indian",
  "Union , they \u2018must give practical proof of their declarations\u2019.5",
  "Later that year, the secretary of Patel\u2019s Home Ministry wrote to the sec-",
  "retaries of all other departments, drawing their attention",
  "to one aspect of security which has assumed urgency and importance in",
  "thepresentcontextofrelationswithPakistan.Thereisgrowingevidence",
  "that a section of Muslims in India is out of sympathy with the Govern-",
  "ment of India, particularly because of its policy regarding Kashmir and",
  "Hyderabad, and is actively sympathetic to Pakistan. Such Government",
  "servantsarelikelytobeusefulchannelsofinformationandwouldbepar-",
  "ticularly susceptible to the influence of their relatives.",
  "It is probable that among Muslim employees of Government there are",
  "some who belong to these categories. It is obvious that they constitute",
  "a dangerous element in the fabric of administration; and it is essential",
  "that they should not be entrusted with any confidential or secret work or",
  "allowed to hold key posts. For this purpose I would request you to pre-",
  "pare lists of Muslim employees in your Ministry and in the offices under",
  "yourcontrol,whoseloyaltytotheDominionofIndiaissuspectedorwho",
  "arelikelytoconstituteathreattosecurity.Theselistsshouldbecarefully",
  "preparedandscrutinisedbytheHeadsofDepartmentsorotherhigherau-",
  "thority,andshouldbeusedforthespecificpurposesofexcludingpersons",
  "from holding key posts or handling confidential or secret work.",
  "I need scarcely add that I am sure you will see that there is no witch",
  "hunting; and that only genuine cases are included in the lists. Those who",
  "are loyal and whose work is satisfactory should of course be given every",
  "cause to feel that their claims are no less than those of men belonging to",
  "the majoritycommunity.6",
  "This was an extraordinary letter, which sparked, if not a witch-hunt, an ener-",
  "getic attempt to seek out traces of disloyalty among the Muslim employees of",
  "the government of India. Consider the case of the Archaeological Survey of",
  "India(ASI),whichhadnumerousMuslimemployees,theseentrustedwiththe",
  "upkeepofthegreatbuildingsofmedievalIndia.Whenpassedthisletterbythe",
  "educationsecretary,theASI\u2019sdirectorgeneralwrotetohiscircleheadsaskingthemtofurnishlistsofMuslimemployees,thoseloyaltotheDominionofIn-",
  "dia, and those \u2018likely to constitute a danger to security\u2019. The circle heads then",
  "commenced secret investigations among their staff, the results of which were",
  "communicated back to headquarters. Half a century later, their reports make",
  "for interesting and in some cases chilling reading.",
  "Severalheadswrotebacksayingthattheydidnotpersonallydistrustany",
  "of their employees. However, they were pressured to transfer those likely to",
  "be in a position of vulnerability. The major of an infantry unit in Bijapur had",
  "advisedtheASIthatthecustodianoftheGolGumbuzwas\u2018notconsideredre-",
  "liable\u2019; he, apparently, had relatives in Hyderabad, a state which was refusing",
  "to join the Union. The custodian was then transferred to the Kanheri Caves in",
  "Bombay.",
  "The most detailed report came from the superintendent of the northern",
  "circle,headquarteredinAgra,andwhichhadwithinitspurviewtheTajMahal",
  "andFatehpurSikri.Helistedtwenty-eightemployeeswhoserelativeshadmi-",

  "Agra Fort, with a brother, son and mother in Hyderabad (Sindh); another a",
  "watchmanattheTajMahalwithawifeinKarachi.AnotherTajwatchmanhad",
  "two sons and a daughter in Karachi. The superintendent listed another seven",
  "employees who \u2018do not seem mischievous by nature, but may prove a useful",
  "channel for communicating information under the influence of their relations",
  "in Pakistan\u2019.",
  "On 20 October the home secretary sent a follow-up letter, targeting offi-",
  "cialswhohadcloserelativesinPakistan.Nowthatseveralmonthshadpassed",
  "since Partition, he said, \u2018there was no longer any reason [for] Government",
  "servants to keep their families in Pakistan. On the contrary, having regard to",
  "the strained relations between the two Dominions that would be prima facie",
  "evidence ofdisloyalty totheDominion ofIndia\u2019.Employees withfamilies in",
  "Pakistan would have to bring them back within a month. The Home Ministry",
  "askedforlistsofdelinquents;itwouldthendecide,casebycase,whether\u2018the",
  "interests of the country\u2019 required disciplinary action against them.",
  "Once more, the home secretary\u2019s instructions were passed on by the dir-",
  "ector general of the ASI to all his circle heads. Once more, the most detailed",
  "report came from the superintendent of the Agra circle, who did seem to re-",
  "gardthis,withsomerelish,asasortofwitch-hunt.Hisirewasreservedpartic-",
  "ularly for the khadims, or hereditary watchmen, of the Taj Mahal, eighteen in",
  "all, whose posts were created by Emperor Shah Jahan in the seventeenth cen-tury,andlater confirmed bythe British. Inthe eyes ofthe superintendent they",
  "seemed all to be enemy agents, \u2018unwilling to tell the whole truth about them-",
  "selves\u2019. At least six still had families in Pakistan. One khadim had overstayed",
  "with his relatives across the border; he had been suspended, and ordered to",
  "\u2018handoverbothsummerandwinterliveriesandallotherGovernmentarticles",
  "in his possession\u2019. The superintendent wanted to suspend a second khadim,",
  "whomhesuspectedofwantingonlytosellhispropertyinAgrabeforemigrat-",
  "ing \u2018to Pakistan surreptitiously\u2019. He had also targeted a third, who \u2018appears to",
  "have made efforts though not energetic enough to bring back the members of",
  "his family to India\u2019.",
  "Agra lay in the United Provinces, whose Muslims were very deeply di-",
  "vided indeed. The Muslims of the Punjab had migrated en masse across the",
  "border. From Bombay and the south, many intellectuals had voluntarily mi-",
  "gratedtoPakistan,buttheworking-classMuslimshadstayedbehind.Pakistan",
  "was too far and too alien for them to consider making a new life in a new",
  "place. However, the UP Mussalman spoke Urdu \u2013 the official language of",
  "Pakistan \u2013 and also lived close enough to be able to jump aboard a train and",
  "go there. Many went; many others stayed where they were.",
  "Almost every Muslim family in the UP was divided, and the employees",
  "oftheASIwerenoexception.ThesuperintendentoftheAgracircle,however,",
  "had no sympathy for employees with kin in what he considered \u2018enemy\u2019 ter-",
  "ritory. Bring them back, he told his subordinates, or face the consequences.",
  "A khadim named Shamsuddin had excited his boss\u2019s suspicion by selling his",
  "housewhenhisentire family wasinPakistan. Inasomewhat pathetic petition",
  "dated 8 December 1948, Shamsuddin said that he had \u2018not the least idea of",
  "ever going to Pakistan\u2019. There were four reasons why he had disposed of his",
  "house:(1)topaybackadebtheowedhisrelatives;(2)as\u2018mydaughtersareto",
  "bemarried,andIhavetoinvestmoneyinthispeon\u2019sdutyofmine\u2019;(3)asthe",

  "best to sell it before its condition further deteriorated; (4) as \u2018I have to make",
  "arrangementsforthelastceremoniesofmylifeasmysonshavedesertedme\u2019.",
  "The superintendent was not convinced, demanding more positive proof",
  "of Shamsuddin\u2019s loyalty to the Union of India. A note of 13 June 1949 tells",
  "us that the khadim had travelled to Pakistan, and brought back with him his",
  "twounmarrieddaughters,andtwograndchildrenofadeceaseddaughter\u2018over",
  "whom he could exercise control\u2019.7",
  "Were the records of the government of India ever to be thrown open",
  "for those years, one might find that such loyalty oaths, extracted under pres-",
  "surebyseniorofficials,wereverynearlyubiquitous.Onescholarhasrecentlyfound a statement issued in 1951 by Muslim pastoralists of Kachchh, the",

  "This assured the chief commissioner that \u2018we are loyal to the Government of",
  "India,andif[the]PakistangovernmentattackstheIndiangovernment,wewill",
  "sacrifice our lives for the security of India\u2019.8",
  "IV",
  "Itisnotclearwhethertheprimeministerapprovedoftheattemptstoascertain",
  "the loyalty of certain select employees of the government of India. But we do",
  "know that his view of the Muslim situation was somewhat different from that",
  "ofhisdeputy.AshewrotetoPatel,hedeploredthe\u2018constantcryforretaliation",
  "and of vicarious punishment of the Muslims of India, because the Pakistanis",
  "punishHindus.Thatargumentdoesnotappealtomeintheslightest.Iamsure",
  "that this policy of retaliation and vicarious punishment will ruin India as well",
  "as Pakistan.\u20199 Where the home minister demanded that the Muslims prove",
  "theirloyalty,theprimeministerplacedtheonusontheIndianstate,whichhad",
  "aconstitutional obligation tomake all its citizens, butthe Muslims especially,",
  "feel secure.",
  "Nehru expressed these views both to Patel and in a series of letters he",
  "wrote to the chief ministers of various provinces.10 Three months after Parti-",
  "tion he reminded them that",
  "wehaveaMuslimminoritywhoaresolargeinnumbersthattheycannot,",
  "even if they want, go anywhere else. That is a basic fact about which",
  "there can be no argument. Whatever the provocation from Pakistan and",
  "whatever the indignities and horrors inflicted on non-Muslims there, we",
  "have got to deal with this minority in a civilized manner. We must give",
  "them security and the rights of citizens in a democratic State. If we fail",
  "to do so, we shall have a festering sore which will eventually poison the",
  "whole body politic and probably destroy it.",
  "Later in the same letter, he drew attention to \u2018the paramount importance of",
  "preserving the public services from the virus of communal politics\u2019.11",
  "This was a subject to which Nehru had necessarily to return. One pro-",
  "vocation was quarrels about property, for in some places Muslims were beingaskedbyover-energeticofficerstogiveuptheirhomesinfavourofHinduand",
  "Sikh refugees. The prime minister used the occasion of Gandhi\u2019s birthday to",
  "warn against \u2018creating an atmosphere of uncertainty and lack of security in",
  "the minds of large numbers of our Muslim fellow-countrymen\u2019. For this had",
  "\u2018far-reaching consequences not only in India but also in Kashmir. It affects",
  "our reputation abroad. A few houses or shops attached or taken possession of",
  "do not make very much difference. But, if wrongly done, they do affect our",
  "reputation and thus injure us.\u2019",
  "The prime minister acknowledged that \u2018Pakistan is pursuing a policy of",
  "utter callousness in this matter\u2019. However, he insisted that \u2018we cannot copy",
  "the methods or the ideals of Pakistan. They have declared themselves openly",
  "to be an Islamic State believing in the two-nation theory. We reject the the-",
  "ory and call ourselves a secular State giving full protection to all religions.",
  "Wehavetoliveuptoouridealsanddeclarations.Moreespeciallyonthisday,",
  "Gandhi Jayanti, it is for us to remember what Gandhiji taught us and what he",
  "died for.\u201912",
  "Nehru had made communal organizations his principal target during the",
  "election campaign of 1951\u20132. That election was fought and won on the plank",
  "of not making India a \u2018Hindu Pakistan\u2019. However, Nehru continued to be",
  "worried about the rights of those Indians whose culture and faith demarcated",
  "them from the majority. A particular concern was the very low proportion of",
  "Muslims in positions of authority. There were hardly any Muslim officers left",
  "in the defence services, and not very many in the secretariat. This, he sensed,",
  "was the consequence of a failure in creating a proper \u2019sense of partnership in",
  "every group and individual in the country, a sense of being a full sharer in the",
  "benefitsandopportunitiesthatareoffered\u2019.IfIndiawastobe\u2018asecular,stable",
  "andstrongstate\u2019,hetoldhischiefministers,then\u2018ourfirstconsiderationmust",
  "be to give absolute fair play to our minorities, and thus to make them feel",
  "completely at home in India\u2019.13",
  "V",
  "The acknowledged political leader of the Muslims left behind in the Indian",
  "UnionwasMaulanaAbulKalamAzad.UnlikehisgreatrivalMohammadAli",
  "Jinnah, Azad believed that non-Hindus could live with peace and honour in a",
  "united India. In Nehru\u2019s characteristically eloquent formulation, Maulana Az-",
  "ad was \u2018a peculiar and very special representative in a high degree of thatgreat composite culture which has gradually grown in India\u2019. He embodied",
  "that\u2018synthesisofvariouscultureswhichhavecomeoneafteranothertoIndia,",
  "rivers that have flowed in and lost themselves in the ocean of Indian life\u2019.14",
  "Azad was deeply damaged by Partition. Seeing it as the failure of his",
  "life\u2019smission,heretreatedfromtheworldofpartypolitics(thoughinanycase",
  "his orientation was always more of the scholar than that of the mass leader).",
  "He served as education minister in the Union Cabinet, and in that capacity",
  "helped promote new academies for the nurturing of Indian literature, dance,",
  "music and art. His age and temperament, however, confined him for the most",
  "part to Delhi.",
  "A younger member of the Congress Party seeking amore active political",
  "role was Saif Tyabji, scion of a famous nationalist family. Grandson of an",
  "early president of the Congress, and himself an engineer educated at Cam-",
  "bridge,TyabjiwaswellplacedtobeamodernistbridgebetweentheCongress",
  "and the Muslim masses. In 1955 he wrote a series of essays in the influential",
  "UrdunewspaperInqilab,theselaterpublishedinEnglishtranslationunderthe",
  "title The Future of Muslims in India. In the 1952 election Muslims had voted",
  "in large numbers for the Congress, a party which, under Nehru\u2019s leadership,",
  "they felt they could trust more than its rivals.15 Tyabji, however, felt that the",
  "Muslims should do more than vote for India\u2019s dominant party \u2013 they should",
  "join it, and influence its policies.",
  "Saif Tyabji pointed out that the Congress was a democratic institution,",
  "with its national council made up of elected representatives sent from the",
  "states, these in turn chosen from district and taluk committees. All it cost to",
  "become a member of the Congress was a subscription fee of four annas (a",
  "quarter of a rupee). Spread out across India, the Muslims could enrol in num-",
  "bers in all the districts, thus to influence the selection of Congress leaders at",
  "the higher levels of the organization. Such was Tyabji\u2019s political strategy, but",
  "he also urged his co-religionists to engage more fully with the cultural life of",
  "the country. As a \u2018patriotic Indian\u2019, he wished that the \u2018new Indian Culture\u2019",
  "that was arising \u2018be as rich and varied and vigorous as possible, and this can",
  "only be so if it draws its nourishment from all possible sources\u2019. Like other",
  "kinds of Indians, Muslims had to \u2018take an active part in its formation\u2019. But \u2018if",
  "the Muslims sit back with folded arms, we can rest assured that the new Indi-",
  "anCulturewillhavelittletodowiththeachievementsinthiscountrybetween",
  "the 11th century and the coming of the British. By this all Indians will suf-",
  "fer,buttheresponsibilityforthelosswilllieheavilyonthoseIndianswhoare",
  "Muslims.\u2019Among Tyabji\u2019s other suggestions were that Muslims ask for technical",
  "and commercial education, rather than merely study the humanities and join",
  "the ranks of the educated unemployed. Even as regards humanistic learning,",
  "he deplored the attempts to \u2018keep our Islamic culture . . . in a state of",
  "fossilized purity\u2019. Rather than mourn the decline of their language, Urdu, the",
  "MuslimsshouldrecognizethatHindiintheDevanagariscriptwasheretostay.",
  "Urdu would be made more contemporary by making its literature available",
  "in Devanagari, and by suggesting appropriate words and idioms to enrich the",
  "new, emerging modern Hindi.16",
  "Where the likes of Maulana Azad and Saif Tyabji sought to make",
  "Muslims into Congress Party MPs, there were others who argued that the",
  "community could better represent itself through its own organizations. In",
  "October 1953 a group of intellectuals and professionals met in Aligarh to",
  "discuss the founding of a political party to \u2018protect the minority rights of",
  "Muslims, and to enable them to lead an honourable life in this country\u2019.",
  "AmongtheirconcernswerethelowproportionofMuslimsinthelegislatures,",
  "and in the higher civil service.17 Presiding over the convention was a former",
  "mayor of Calcutta, who claimed that, if present trends continued, the future",
  "held only \u2018economic paralysis, cultural death or disintegration and political",
  "helotageforMuslims\u2019.18Sixmonthslater,inaspeechatDelhi\u2019sJamaMasjid,",

  "and organise themselves under one leadership to face the eventualities in fu-",
  "ture\u2019.19",
  "Meanwhile, in southern India more concrete steps were being taken in",
  "this regard. In September 1951 the \u2018Indian Union Muslim League\u2019 (IUML)",
  "came into being in Madras, both its name and its charter marking it out from",
  "the pre-Partition party some might think it resembled. It sought to \u2018secure,",
  "protect, and maintain\u2019 the religious, cultural, economic and other \u2018legitimate",
  "rights and interests of the Muslims and other minorities\u2019, but also pledged it-",
  "self to upholding and defending \u2018the independence, freedom and honour\u2019 of",
  "the Indian Union.20 Several years later, a party was formed in Hyderabad to",
  "representthecity\u2019sMuslimstheMajlisIttihad-ul-Musilmin.TheMajlisputup",
  "several candidates in the 1957 elections, but won only a single assembly seat.",
  "TheIUMLwasmoresuccessfulinitsownbastionofKerala,whereitwonten",
  "seats in the mid-term election of 1960.21VI",
  "Writing in 1957, W. C. Smith observed that in the history of Islam, Indian",
  "Muslims were unique in that they were very numerous and yet did not live in",
  "astateoftheirown.UnliketheMuslimsofIran,Iraq,PakistanorTurkey,they",
  "shared their citizenship in the new Indian republic \u2018with an immense number",
  "ofotherpeople.TheyconstitutetheonlysizablebodyofMuslimsintheworld",
  "of which this is, or ever has been, true.22",
  "The Muslims of India were a large minority, as well as a vulnerable one.",
  "They were under threat from Hindu communalism, and from the provoca-",
  "tion of Pakistan. The leaders of that nation tended to deride Indian secular-",
  "ism, and \u2018to presume and encourage a disloyalty of Indian Muslims to their",
  "state\u2019 Muslims were hostage to India\u2014Pakistan relations in general, and to",

  "Muslims who remained were the labouring poor, the peasants, labourers and",
  "artisans who were now seriously in want of an enlightened and liberal lead-",
  "ership. As one perceptive British official wrote, it was \u2018one of the curses of",
  "Partition\u2019 in Bengal that \u2018the Muslim officers had all opted for Pakistan\u2019, so",
  "that \u2018the Muslim minorities in West Bengal will be without representation",
  "in the services or anywhere else where they could look for help or protec-",
  "tion\u2019.24 A partial exception was Kashmir, where under Sheikh Abdullah\u2019s re-",
  "gime between 1947 and 1953 Muslims were encouraged to own land, take to",
  "the professions and, above all, to educate themselves. Among the more far-",
  "sighted reforms were the creation of schools and colleges for girls, with the",
  "Women\u2019s College in Srinagar justly winning a countrywide reputation for ex-",
  "cellence.25 Elsewhere, Muslims continued to labour in menial jobs while be-",
  "ing under-represented in education, in the professions, in the legislatures and",
  "in the administration.26",

  "Nehru was the key figure here, but he was aided by other Congress memberswho had studied in the school of Gandhi. When street clashes threatened to",
  "escalate into a major riot in Ahmedabad in 1956, the chief minister, Morarji",
  "Desai, went on an indefinite fast to bring back the peace.27 Such acts were",
  "prompted in part by genuine belief, and in part by diplomatic exigencies \u2013",
  "the need to put one\u2019s best face outwards while making the case for Kashmir.",
  "Attacks on Muslims would make India\u2019s claim for the Valley more fragile.28",
  "Still, it was \u2018no small matter that the Hindu leaders of the nation, in the name",
  "of secularism and humanity, restrained the natural and potentially ferocious",
  "impetus of the Hindu majority to wreak vengeance on the Muslim group\u2019.29",
  "Immediately after Partition some had feared a conflagration that would",
  "destroy the Muslim minority in India. Instead, as Mushirul Hasan has noted,",
  "\u2018the communal temperature in the 1950s remained relatively low. There was",
  "a lull after a violent storm, a clear and downward trend in communal incid-",
  "ents.\u201930Therewassuspicionandtensionontheground,andoccasionalviolent",

  "The conflicts of the 1950s were rooted in language, ethnicity, class and caste,",
  "rather than in religion.",
  "The lull was broken by the Jabalpur riots of early 1961, in which some",
  "fifty Indians, mostly Muslims, lost their lives. But this was a minor affray in",
  "comparison with what happened in the winter of 1963/ 4 when the theft of",
  "the Prophet\u2019s hair from the Hazratbal mosque in Srinagar prompted a series",
  "of attacks on Hindus in distant East Pakistan. Thousands of refugees fled into",
  "India, their stories leading to a rise in the communal temperature and to re-",

  "ished, most of them Muslims.31",
  "BythistimePartitionwasalmosttwodecadesinthepast,yetitsresidues",

  "are ready to seize the opportunity\u2019.32",

  "theywerealsopoor,stigmatizedandoftenonthereceivingendofupper-caste",

  "very sight too. They were denied access to land and to water sources; even",
  "their homes were set apart from the main village.",
  "Under British rule, opportunities had arisen for some Untouchables to",
  "escape the tyranny of the village. These gained employment in the army, or",
  "worked in factories and urban settlements. Here too they were usually as-",
  "signed the most menial jobs, as well as the most degrading.",
  "Gandhi had redesignated the Untouchables as \u2018Harijans\u2019, or children",
  "of God. The Constitution of India abolished untouchability and listed the",
  "erstwhile Untouchable communities in a separate schedule \u2013 hence their new,",
  "collective name, \u2018Scheduled Castes\u2019. However, village ethnographies of the",
  "1950s confirmed that the practice of untouchability continued as before. The",
  "Scheduled Castes still owned little or no land, and were still subject to social",
  "and in some cases sexual abuse. But these ethnographies also revealed that at",
  "the bottom things were changing, albeit slowly. In some parts the low castes",
  "were refusing to perform tasks that they considered demeaning. No longer",
  "would they carry loads for free, or submissively allow upper-caste males to",
  "violate their women. More daringly, they were beginning to ask for higher",
  "wages and for land to cultivate, sometimes under the aegis of communist act-",
  "ivists.33",
  "Inthecities,lower-casteassertiontookamoreorganizedform.Underthe",
  "encouragement of the Communist Party of India, the municipal sweepers of",
  "Delhi who belonged to the Balmiki caste \u2013 formed a union of their own. In",
  "October 1953 this union presented a charter of eleven demands to the muni-",
  "cipal corporation, focusing on better pay and work conditions. The sweepers",
  "heldprocessionsandpublicmeetings,andmarchedtothetownhallinashow",
  "of strength. There were also a series of hunger strikes, and at least one major",
  "confrontation with the police. The historian of these protests notes that they",
  "were \u2019not just about wages, but also about dignity and the value of the labour",
  "of the Balmikis\u2019.34",
  "VIIIThe burgeoning genre of Untouchable autobiographies also shows the 1950s",
  "to be a time of flux. Caste prejudice and caste discrimination were rampant,",
  "but no longer were they accepted so passively. There was an incipient stirring",
  "whichbecamemanifestinsocialprotestandwasaidedbythenewavenuesof",
  "social mobility.35",
  "The first such avenue was education. After Independence there was a",
  "great expansion in school and college education. By law, a certain portion",
  "of seats were reserved for the Scheduled Castes. By policy, different state",
  "governments endowed scholarships for children from disadvantaged homes.",
  "Wheretheycouldtheytookadvantage,spawninganentiregenerationoffirst-",
  "generation learners. According to one estimate, while the school population",
  "doubled in the first decade of Independence, the number of ex-Untouchables",
  "in schools swelled eight or tenfold. There were also many more Scheduled",
  "Caste students at university than ever before.36",
  "A second avenue was government employment. By law, 15 per cent of",
  "all jobs in state and state-aided institutions were reserved for the Scheduled",
  "Castes. Again, there was a massive expansion after 1947, with new positions",
  "availableintheSecretariatandingovernment-runschools,hospitals,factories",
  "and infrastructure projects. Although exact figures are hard to obtain, it is",
  "likely that several million jobs were created for Scheduled Castes in the state",
  "sectorinthefirsttwodecadesafterIndependence.Thesewerepermanentpos-",
  "itions, toberetained until retirement, andwithpensionandhealth benefits. In",
  "theory,suchreservation existed atalllevels ofgovernment; inpractice, itwas",
  "the reserved posts at the lower levels that tended to be filled first and fastest.",
  "As late as 1966, while only 1.77 per cent of senior administrative posts were",
  "occupied by Indians of low-caste origin, 8.86 per cent of clerical jobs were,",
  "and as many as 17.94 per cent of posts of peons and attendants.37",
  "There was also reservation in Parliament and state assemblies, where 15",
  "per cent of all seats were filled by Scheduled Caste candidates. Besides, uni-",
  "versal franchise meant that they could influence the outcome of elections in",
  "the\u2019unreservedcategoryaswell.Inmanyparts,ScheduledCasteswerequick",
  "to seize the opportunities the vote presented them. As one low-caste politi-",
  "cian in Agra observed, his constituents \u2018may not understand the intricacies of",
  "politics\u2019, but they did \u2018understand the power of the vote and want to use it\u2019.38",
  "Andtheyunderstooditinallcontexts\u2013national,provincialandlocal.Already",
  "in the early 1950s, cases were reported of Scheduled Castes forging alliances",

  "stigma. Intended to end caste discrimination, it fixed the beneficiaries ever",
  "more firmly in their own, original caste. There was suspicion and resentment",
  "among the upper castes, and sometimes a tendency among the beneficiaries",
  "to look down upon, or even forget, their fellows. As one scholar somewhat",

  "ory worker in Bombay and learnt to love the city\u2019s museums, its collections",
  "of Gandhara art especially.42 And sometimes there were economic gains to be",

  "shoemakers, some Jatavs were able to open factories of their own, where the",
  "wages paid to their workers were considerably in excess of what they them-",
  "selves had once hoped to earn. In 1960 a master craftsman took home about",
  "Rs250 a month, a factory worker about Rs100 \u2013 even the lesser figure was",
  "many times what an unskilled labourer earned. Although the distribution of",
  "gains was by no means even, the market had helped enhance their econom-",
  "ic as well as social status. The present state of affairs was \u2018a far cry from the",
  "pre-1900 days, when most Jatavs were little more than labourers and city ser-",
  "vants\u2019.43",
  "IXAs with the Muslims, the Scheduled Castes formed an important \u2018vote bank\u2019",
  "for the Congress. They too tended to trust the party of Mahatma Gandhi more",
  "than its rivals. In the 1957 election, for example, the Congress won 64 out of",
  "the 76 seats reserved for Scheduled Castes in Parliament, and as many as 361",
  "out of the 469 reserved for them in the legislative assemblies.",
  "When the seats reserved for Scheduled Tribe members were added,",

  "to find suitable non-Brahmins.\u2019 Nehru asked the colleague to suggest candid-",
  "ates, but then found one himself: a Mrs Chandrasekhar from Madras, an edu-",
  "cated Scheduled Caste whom he inducted as deputy minister.44",

  "Jagjivan Ram had the reputation of being a first-class administrator, although",
  "he did not live the kind of squeaky-clean life his Gandhian background per-",

  "The most charismatic Scheduled Caste leader, however, remained out-",
  "sidetheCongress.ThiswasB.R.Ambedkar,whohadjoinedNehru\u2019sCabinet",
  "as an Independent, leaving the government in 1951 to restart his Scheduled",
  "Caste Federation. His party fared disastrously in the 1952 election, although",
  "Ambedkar himself was later elected to the Upper House. By now this long-",
  "time foe of Hinduism was seeking to find a way of leaving the ancestral fold.",
  "He had contemplated converting to Sikhism, then to Islam, then to Chris-",
  "tianity. Ambedkar finally settled on Buddhism, a faith of Indian origin that",
  "seemed best suited to his own rationalist and egalitarian temperament.",
  "After he left the Cabinet, Ambedkar immersed himself in literature on",
  "or about the Buddha. He became a member of the Mahabodhi Society and",
  "travelled through the Buddhist countries of south-east Asia. At a public meet-",
  "ing in Bombay in May 1956, Ambedkar announced that he would convert to",
  "Buddhism before the end of the year. His mammoth study The Buddha and",
  "his Dhamma was already in the press. Ambedkar considered holding the con-",
  "versionceremonyinBombay\u2013wherethepublicitywouldbeimmense\u2013orin",
  "the ancient Buddhist site of Sarnath. In the event he chose Nagpur, a city in",
  "the centre of India where he had a large and devoted following. Many joinedhim in embracing Buddhism, in a colourful and well-attended ceremony that",
  "took place on 15 October 1956. Six weeks later Ambedkar died suddenly. He",
  "was cremated in Bombay, with an icon of the Buddha placed under his head.",
  "A million people participated in the funeral procession.46",
  "Shortly before he died Ambedkar had decided to float a new party, the",
  "Republican Party of India. This formally came into being in 1957. Its lead-",
  "ers and cadre were, like Ambedkar himself, from the Mahar caste. It was also",
  "mostly Mahars who had followed their leader into Buddhism. Ambedkar was",
  "a figure of reverence among the Mahars of the Nagpur area. In his lifetime",
  "they celebrated his birthday with gusto, taking out processions holding his",
  "photograph aloft. When he came to town to speak, the factory workers would",

  "Ambedkar\u2019s slogan for his followers was: \u2018Educate, Agitate, Organize\u2019.",
  "He setup a People\u2019s Education Society that ran schools and at least two good",

  "inevitably to regard Ambedkar as their mentor. Among the Scheduled Caste",
  "intelligentsia, books or pamphlets by Ambedkar became required reading,",
  "lovingly passed on from hand to hand.48 Thus the son of a dock worker, sent",
  "by government scholarship to the Siddharth College in Bombay, began con-",
  "tributing to magazines and participating in debates \u2013 where \u2018the topic of all",
  "these writings and speeches was always Babasaheb [Ambedkar] and his Dalit",
  "movement\u2019.49",
  "The presence of B. R. Ambedkar underlines a quite profound difference",
  "between the Scheduled Castes and the other minority with whom I have here",
  "compared them. For the Muslims had no seats reserved for them in the Sec-",
  "retariat or in Parliament. Nor, in independent India, did they have a leader ofAmbedkar\u2019s stature to inspire and move them \u2013 while he was alive or long",

  "Two decades later India became independent, and the constitution bestowed",
  "rights of equality on all citizens, regardless of caste, creed, age or gender.",
  "The lower castes were in fact granted special rights, special access to schools",
  "and jobs, in compensation for the discrimination they had suffered down the",
  "centuries. But, as a Scheduled Caste member of the Constituent Assembly",
  "pointed out, state law was one thing, social practice quite another. For the",
  "prejudices of caste had been opposed by reformers down the centuries, from",
  "Gautama Buddha to Mahatma Gandhi, yet they had all \u2018foundit very difficult",
  "to get rid of this ghost of untouchability\u2019. Laws had been enacted removing",
  "strictures against Untouchables, with regard to temple entry for example.",
  "\u2018What is the effect of these laws?\u2019 asked the member, before supplying this",
  "answer: \u2018Not an inch of untouchability has been removed by these laws . . .",
  "If at all the ghost of untouchability or the stigma of untouchability from In-",
  "dia should go the minds of these crores and crores of Hindu folks should be",
  "changed and unless their hearts are changed, I do not hope, Sir, that untouch-",
  "ability will be removed. It is now up to the Hindu society not to observe un-",
  "touchability in any shape or form.\u201954",
  "There was pessimism about the position of Untouchables in free India,",
  "and pessimism also about the future of that other large and insecure minority,",
  "the Muslims. Travelling through India and Pakistan in 1951, the Aga Khan",

  "India was to Muslim Pakistan as Christian Sudan was to Muslim Egypt. As",
  "he putit, \u2018I have felt that this atmosphere of doom [which] prevails amongst",
  "Muslims on account of this very water question . . . is a replica of the similar",
  "fear in Egypt\u2019.55",
  "This letter is notable for at least three reasons. First, as an early illustra-",
  "tion of the now widespread fear that Muslims were being persecuted world-",
  "wide.Second,foritseasyequationoftheinterestsofIndianMuslimswiththe",
  "welfare of Pakistan. Finally, and perhaps most tellingly, for its prediction that",
  "the Republic of India would become a Hindu state within ten years.",

  "skepticism \u2013 right with regard to the continuing social prejudice, wrong with",

  "were in fact very careful of the rights of the many. Writing in 1959 \u2013 a dec-",

  "Recalling the \u2018reactionary forces which came into play after partition\u2019, the",
  "editor remarked that \u2018had Nehru shown the slightest weakness, these forces",
  "would have turned this country into a Hindu state in which the minorities. .",
  ". could not have lived with any measure of safety or security . It was also to",
  "Nehru\u2019s \u2018everlasting credit that he insisted that Untouchables be granted full",
  "rights, such that \u2018in public life and in all government action, the equality of",
  "man would be scrupulously maintained in the secular state of India\u2019.56",
  "To be sure, there remained a slippage between public policy and popular",
  "practice. The laws promoting secularism and social equality were on the stat-",
  "ute books, but most Muslims, and most Scheduled Castes, remained poor",
  "and marginalized. The threat of violence was never far away. Still, given the",
  "bloody birth of the nation, and the continuing provocation from Pakistan, it",
  "was no small matter that the Indian government refused to merge faith with",
  "state. And given the resilience of social institutions in general, and the an-",
