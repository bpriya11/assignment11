  "seems to have written itself off as a nationally cohesive force\u2019. The once-",
  "mighty party was now split into disputatious parts. When the next general",
  "election came, said Thought, \u2018Congressmen will be fighting Congressmen to",
  "the obvious advantage of regional or sectarian groups\u2019. Consequently, \u2018Mrs",
  "Gandhi\u2019s party may not secure more than one-third of the seats in Parliament.",
  "The chances of the other group seem to be even slimmer.\u20191",
  "A year later the prime minister called an election, fourteen months ahead",
  "of schedule. Her party \u2013 Congress (R) \u2013 wanted a popular mandate to imple-",
  "ment the progressive reforms it had initiated, now held up by the \u2018reactionary\u2019",
  "forces in Parliament. Its manifesto offered a \u2018genuine radical programme of",
  "economic and social development\u2019, upholding the interests of the small farmer",
  "and the landless labourer, and of the small entrepreneur against the big capital-",
  "ist. It stood for the betterment of the lower castes, and for the protection of the",
  "minorities. Particular mention was made of the Urdu language, which \u2018shall be",

  "ment of what it said it stood for.",
  "In calling an early poll, the prime minister had astutely dissociated the",

  "ofcasteandethnicitygotmixedupwithwidernationalquestions.In1967this",
  "had proved to be detrimental to the Congress. This time, Mrs Gandhi made",
  "sure she would separate the two by calling a general election in which she",
  "could place a properly national agenda before the electorate.",
  "The opposition, meanwhile, was seeking to build a united front against",
  "the ruling party. Urging it on was C. Rajagopalachari, now past ninety years",
  "of age. A common leader could not be agreed upon so, said \u2018Rajaji\u2019, the fight",
  "had to be conducted \u2018on the pattern of guerrilla warfare. Indira\u2019s candidates .",
  ". . must be opposed everywhere on the single ground that we oppose the con-",
  "spiracy to tear up the constitution and to extinguish the people\u2019s liberties and",
  "put all power in the hands of the state\u2019.3",
  "The opposition constructed a \u2018Grand Alliance\u2019, bringing together Jana",
  "Sangh, Swatantra, Congress (O), the socialists, and regional groupings. The",

  "whereas we want an End to Poverty itself).",
  "Whethertheworkoftheprimeministeroroneofhernowforgottenmin-",

  "the moral high ground, representing itself as the party of progress, against an",
  "alliance of reaction. Personalizing the election was to backfire badly against",
  "the opposition, whose agenda was portrayed as negative in contrast to the",
  "forward-looking programme of the ruling party.",
  "Mrs Gandhi worked tirelessly to garner votes for her party. Between the",
  "dissolution of Parliament, in the last week of December 1970, and the elec-",
  "tions, held ten weeks later, she travelled 36,000 miles in all. She addressed",

  "\u2018old\u2019 Congress was in thrall to \u2018conservative elements\u2019 and \u2018vested interests\u2019,",
  "whereas the \u2018new\u2019 Congress was committed to the poor. Did not the national-",

  "Her travels within India had made the prime minister far better known than",

  "organizational weakness was remedied by its young volunteers, who went",
  "around the countryside amplifying their leader\u2019s words. The massive turnout",
  "on election day suggested that \u2018the people had been fired with a new hope of",
  "redemption\u2019.6",
  "Back in 1952 it had been said that even a lamp-post could win if it ran",
  "on the Congress symbol. It turned out that Mrs Gandhi\u2019s victory was even",
  "more spectacular than her father\u2019s. Congress (R) won 352 out of 518 seats;",
  "the next highest tally was that of the CPM, which won a mere 25. Both victor",
  "and vanquished agreed that this was chiefly the work of one person. As the",
  "writer Khush want Singh commented, \u2018Indira Gandhi has successfully mag-",
  "nified her figure as the one and only leader of national dimensions\u2019. Then he",
  "added, ominously: \u2018However, if power is voluntarily surrendered by a pre-",
  "dominant section of the people to one person and at the same time opposition",
  "is reduced to insignificance, the temptation to ride roughshod over legitimate",

  "bridled power shall always be present.\u20197",
  "Among the consequences of the 1971 election was a change in the name",
  "of the ruling party. The Congress (R) now became known as Congress (I), for",
  "\u2018Indira\u2019; later, even this was dropped. By the margin of its victory, Indira\u2019s",
  "Congress was confirmed as the real Congress, requiring no qualifying suffix.",
  "HersuccessatthepollsemboldenedMrsGandhitoactdecisivelyagainst",
  "the princes. Throughout 1971, the two sides tried and failed to find a settle-",
  "ment. The princes were willing to forgo their privy purses, but hoped at least",
  "to save their titles. But with her massive majority in Parliament, the prime",
  "minister had no need to compromise. On 2 December she introduced a bill",
  "seeking to amend the constitution and abolish all princely privileges. It waspassed in the Lok Sabha by 381 votes to 6, and in the Rajya Sabha by 167",
  "votes to 7. In her own speech, the prime minister invited \u2018the princes to join",
  "the elite of the modern age, the \u00e9lite which earns respect by its talent, energy",
  "and contribution to human progress, all of which can only be done when we",
  "work together as equals without regarding anybody as of special status\u2019.8",
  "II",
  "The statistics of the fifth general election were printed in loving detail in the",
  "report of the Chief Election Commissioner (CEC). The size of the electorate",
  "was 275 million, a 100 million up from the first edition in 1952. Yet no In-",
  "dian had to walk more than two kilometres to exercise his or her franchise.",
  "Therewerenow342,944pollingstations,up100,000from1962;eachstation",
  "was supplied with forty-three different items ranging from ballot papers and",
  "boxestoindelibleinkandsealingwax;282millionballotpaperswereprinted,",
  "7 million more than the number of eligible voters (to allow for accidents and",
  "errors);1,769,802Indianswereonpollingduty\u2013forthemostpart,thesewere",
  "officials of the state and central governments.",
  "The CEC then turned, with less pleasure, to electoral malpractices. A",
  "study of the 1967 elections had found 375 cases of electoral violence of all",
  "kinds; of these, 98 were in Bihar.9 In 1971 the Election Commission repor-",
  "ted66instancesof\u2018booth-capturing\u2019,whereballotboxeswereseizedbyforce",
  "and stuffed with ballots in favour of one candidate. In Anantnag in the Kash-",
  "mir Valley a woman took away a ballot box under her burqa before returning",
  "it, now heavier by several hundred ballots. Again, the most violations were in",
  "Bihar\u2013thestateaccountedfor52of66boothscapturedbyhooliganshiredby",
  "leaders of caste factions. The CEC believed this was \u2018perhaps the most caste-",
  "ridden State in the whole [of] India and this bane of excessive casteism viti-",
  "ates in no mean degree the political atmosphere\u2019.",
  "These disfigurements notwithstanding, the holding of its fifth general",
  "electionwasamatteronwhichthecountrycouldcongratulateitself.Sowrote",
  "the CEC, in a preface whose lyricism sat oddly with the hard nosed numer-",
  "ical analysis that followed. For in between the last poll and this one, \u2018India",
  "was in the middle of the deepest and darkest woods and was groping for a",
  "way out\u2019. Factionalism was rife; SVD governments came and went, and the",
  "president of the republic died, making \u2018the already dark political situation . .",
  ". darker\u2019. Then the mighty Congress Party split; this, in the CEC\u2019s view, wascomparableonlyto\u2018theGreatSchismintheWhigPartyinGreatBritaininthe",
  "year1796\u2019.Inthis\u2018stateoftension,stress,confusionandflux,theprophetsof",
  "doom, both inside and outside the country, started expressing serious misgiv-",
  "ings and doubts as to the very survival of democracy in this Great Land\u2019.",
  "These doomsayers, said the chief election commissioner, had not",
  "reckoned with Bharata Bhagya Vidhata (The Supreme Dispenser of India\u2019s",
  "Destiny), which from \u2018ancient times\u2019 had thwarted \u2018adverse and hostile cir-",
  "cumstances\u2019, by blowing \u2018into the soul of India that elixir-giving inspiration",
  "which imparted rejuvenated vigour to her vital, moral and spiritual forces\u2019.",
  "Others might have disagreed, seeing the holding of this election not as a vic-",
  "tory for Indian spiritualism but as a vindication of that very modern political",
  "form, electoral democracy.10",

  "Yahya Khan, Ayub Khan\u2019s successor as president and chief martial law ad-",
  "ministrator.",
  "Two parties dominated the campaign; Zulfiqar Bhutto\u2019s Pakistan",
  "People\u2019s Party in West Pakistan, and the National Awami League of Sheikh",
  "Mujibur Rahman (\u2018Mujib\u2019) in East Pakistan. The son of a large landowner,",
  "educated at Oxford and Berkeley, Bhutto sought to declass himself, at least",
  "rhetorically, by promising every Pakistani roti, kapda aur makaan (food,",
  "clothing and a roof over your heads). Mujib\u2019s campaign was based on East",
  "Pakistan\u2019ssenseofvictimhood,itsangeratthesuppressionoftheBengalilan-",
  "guage and the exploitation of its rich natural resources by the military rulers",
  "of the western half of the country.11",
  "YahyaKhanappearstohavecalledforelectionsinthehopethatBhutto\u2019s",
  "PPP would win, and allow him to continue as president. The polls were held",
  "in the third week of December 1970. The PPP won 88 out of the 144 seats",
  "in West Pakistan, whereas the Awami League swept the more populous East,",
  "winning 167 of its 169 seats. These results surprised Mujibur Rahman, and",
  "shocked Yahya Khan. For the president had intended that the newly elected",
  "assembly would frame a democratic constitution; the worry now was that the",
  "Awami League, with its majority, would insist on a federation where the east-",
  "ern wing would manage its own affairs, leaving only defence and foreignpolicy to the central government. Mujib had already indicated that he would",
  "like East Pakistan to have control over the foreign exchange its products gen-",
  "erated, and perhaps issue its own currency as well.",
  "Yahya\u2019sreservationswerereinforcedbytheambitionsofBhutto.Forthe",

  "Awami League came to form the government, \u2018the constitution to be adopted",
  "by them will have Hindu iron hand in it\u2019.12",
  "On the other side, the East Pakistani Muslims looked upon their West",
  "Pakistani counterparts as \u2018the ruling classes, as foreign ruling classes and as",
  "predatory foreign ruling classes\u2019. They resented the rulers\u2019 dismissal of their",
  "language, Bengali; they complained that their agricultural wealth was being",
  "drained away to feed the western sector; and they noted that Bengalis were",
  "very poorly represented in the upper echelons of the Pakistani bureaucracy,",
  "judiciary and, not least, army. The feeling of being discriminated against had",
  "beengrowingovertheyears.Bythetimeoftheelectionsof1970,\u2018thepolitic-",
  "ally minded\u2019 East Bengali had become \u2018allergic to a central authority located",
  "a thousand miles away\u2019.13",
  "In January 1971 Yahya Khan and Bhutto travelled separately to the East",
  "Pakistani capital, Dacca. They held talks with Mujib, but found him firm on",
  "the question of a federal constitution. The president then postponed the con-",
  "vening of the National Assembly. The Awami League answered by calling an",
  "indefinitegeneralstrike.ThroughoutEastPakistanshopsandofficesputdown",
  "their shutters; even railways and airports closed down. Clashes between po-",
  "lice and demonstrators became a daily occurrence.",
  "The military decided to quell these protests by force. Troop reinforce-",
  "ments were flown in or sent by ship to the principal eastern port, Chittagong.",
  "On the night of 25/26 March, the army launched a major attack on the uni-",
  "versity,whosestudentswereamongtheAwamiLeague\u2019sstrongestsupporters.",
  "A parade of tanks rolled into the campus, firing on the dormitories. Students",
  "were rounded up, shot and pushed into graves hastily dug and bulldozed over",
  "by tanks. There were troop detachments at work in other parts of the city, tar-",
  "geting Bengali newspaper offices and homes of local politicians. That samenight Mujibur Rahman was arrested at his home and flown off to a secret loc-",
  "ation in West Pakistan.14",
  "The Pakistan army fanned out into the countryside, seeking to stamp out",
  "any sign of rebellion. East Bengali troops mutinied in several places, includ-",
  "ing Chittagong, where one major captured a radio station and announced the",
  "establishmentoftheIndependentPeople\u2019sRepublicofBangladesh.15Tocom-",
  "bat the guerrillas the army raised bands of local loyalists, called Razakars,",
  "who put the claims of religion \u2013 and hence of a united Pakistan \u2013 above those",
  "of language. Villages and small towns, even the odd airport, fell into rebel",
  "hands, then were recaptured. The reprisals grew progressively more brutal.",

  "was more resistance offered by the terrain than by the miscreants. Extensive",
  "damage to land communications and free intermingling of hostiles with the",
  "general populace made progress tedious.\u201917",
  "After the first swoop, foreign correspondents were asked to leave East",
  "Pakistan, but later in the summer some were allowed to return. A German",
  "journalist saw signs of the civil war everywhere: in bazaars burnt in the cities",
  "and homesteads razed in the villages. There was \u2018a ghostly emptiness in set-",
  "tlements once bubbling with life and energy\u2019. An American reporter found",

  "The army action in Dacca sparked a panic flight out of the city. The re-",
  "pression in the hinterland magnified this flight, directing it across the border",
  "into India. By the end of April 1971 there were half a million East Pakistan",
  "refugees in India; by the end of May, three and a half million; by the end of",
  "August, in excess of 8 million. Most (though by no means all) were Hindus.19",

  "A key player here was the Research and Analysis Wing (RAW), an in-",

  "of Indian interests worldwide, its activities screened from parliamentary en-",
  "quiry, its orders to report directly to the Prime Minister\u2019s Office. The head of",
  "RAW was (perhaps inevitably) a Kashmiri Brahmin, R. N. Kao, while its of-",
  "ficers were taken from the police and, on occasion, the army. No sooner had",
  "the Pakistani elections been called than RAW was being kept busy writing",
  "reports on that country. A memorandum of January 1971 presented a some-",
  "what alarmist picture of Pakistan\u2019s armed strength: listing numbers of troops,",
  "tanks, aircraft and ships, it claimed that the country had \u2018achieved a good",
  "stateofmilitary preparednessforanyconfrontationwithIndia\u2019.Itthoughtthe",
  "\u2018potential threat\u2019 of an attack on India \u2018quite real, particularly in view of the",
  "Sino-Pakistan collusion\u2019. Besides, the constitutional crisis might encourage",
  "the generals to undertake a diversionary adventure, to begin, as in 1965, with",
  "an \u2018infiltration campaign in Jammu and Kashmir\u2019.22",
  "Whether Yahya Khan had any such plans in January 1971 only the",

  "pleasure that India was winning the propaganda war with Pakistan \u2013 chiefly",
  "by providing succour to the victims of its repression. Some analysts wanted",
  "swift military action but, advised Dhar, instead of \u2018policies and programmes",
  "of impetuosity\u2019, what India had to plan for \u2018is not an immediate defeat of the",
  "highly trained [army] of West Pakistan; we have to create the whole of East",
  "Bengal into a bottomless ditch which will suck the strength and resources ofWest Pakistan. Let us think in terms of a year or two, not in terms of a week",
  "or two.\u201923",

  "Bythesummer of1971,alongwiththehundredsofcamps forrefugees, India",

  "From New Delhi, Kissinger proceeded to Islamabad, and from there \u2013 in",

  "good\u2019, he told Kissinger \u2013 and a sentimental attachment to the leader of the",
  "other. In Nixon\u2019s opinion, Yahya Khan was \u2018a decent and reasonable man\u2019,",
  "whose loyalty to the US had to be rewarded by supporting his suppression of",
  "the East Bengal revolt. When, in April 1971, Kissinger prepared a note sug-",
  "gesting that the future for East Pakistan was \u2018greater autonomy and, perhaps,",
  "eventual independence\u2019, the president scribbled on it: \u2018Don\u2019t squeeze Yahya",
  "at this time\u2019.",
  "As Kissinger somewhat despairingly told a colleague, \u2018the President has",
  "a special feeling for President Yahya. One cannot make policy on that basis,",
  "but it is a fact of life.\u2019 Nixon expressed his prejudices forcefully: speaking to",
  "his staff in August 1971 he said that, while the Pakistanis were \u2018straightfor-",
  "ward\u2019, if \u2018sometimes extremely stupid\u2019, the \u2018Indians are more devious, some-",
  "times so smart that we fall for their line\u2019. The president insisted that the US",
  "\u2018must not \u2013 cannot \u2013 allow India to use the refugees as a pretext for breaking",
  "up Pakistan\u2019.28",
  "As India drew apart from one superpower, it was coming closer to the",
  "other.29 Moscow concurred with New Delhi\u2019s assessment that the \u2018twains of",
  "East and West Pakistan are not likely to meet again\u2019. The USSR and India",

  "In June1971 the Indian foreign minister, Sardar Swaran Singh, was due",
  "to visit Moscow. On the eve of his arrival the Soviet Foreign Ministry ap-",
  "proachedD.P.DharwiththesuggestionthattheUSSRandIndiasignatreaty",
  "of friendship, which would \u2018act as a strong deterrent to force Pakistan and",
  "China to abandon any idea of military adventure\u2019. Dhar was told that \u2018India",
  "need not be worried about Pakistan, but should take into account the unpre-",
  "dictable enemy from the North\u2019 (i.e. China).31 Later, when the two foreign",
  "ministers met, the common suspicion of China figured high on the agenda.",
  "Swaran Singh remarked that China was the only country to give \u2018all out, full",
  "and unequivocal support\u2019 to the Pakistani military regime. Andrei Gromyko",
  "answered that \u2018the Chinese are always against whatever the USSR stands for.",
  "Any cause which we support invites their opposition and anything which we",
  "consider unworthy of our support secures their support. I cannot think of any",
  "particular exception to this general rule.\u201932",
  "Indian hostility to China dated back to the border conflict of 1959\u201362.",
  "Soviet hostility was more recent, a product of rivalry for leadership of the",

  "India and the Soviet Union did not touch one another at any point, but each",
  "had a very long border with China. A closer alliance was in the interest of",
  "both. The secret documents quoted above, however, reveal that, contrary to",
  "the received wisdom, the alliance was first suggested not by the poor under-",
  "developed country but by the powerful superpower.",
  "After meeting Gromyko, Swaran Singh discussed a possible treaty with",
  "the chairman of the USSR Praesidium, Alexei Kosygin. Drafts were ex-",
  "changed before a final document was signed in New Delhi on 9 August 1971",
  "by the foreign ministers of the two sides. For the most part, the Treaty of",
  "Peace, Friendship and Co-operation between the Republic of India and the",
  "Union of Soviet Socialist Republics was pure boilerplate: declarations of un-",
  "dying friendship between the \u2018High Contracting Parties\u2019. The crux lay in a",
  "single sentence of Article IX, to wit:In the event of either Party being subjected to an attack or a threat there-",

  "By the late summer of 1971, the axes of alliance on the subcontinent were",
  "pretty clear: on the one side, there was (West) Pakistan with China and the",
  "United States; on the other, (East) Pakistan with India and the Soviet Union.",
  "V",
  "In the last week of September 1971 the prime minister travelled to the Soviet",
  "Union. The next month she visited a series of Western cities, ending in the",
  "capital of the free world. Everywhere, she spoke of the deepening crisis in",
  "East Pakistan. As she told the National Press Club in Washington, this was",
  "\u2018notacivilwar,intheordinarysenseoftheword;itisagenocidalpunishment",

  "On her November visit Mrs Gandhi had two meetings with President",
  "Nixon. Kissinger had the impression that this was \u2018a classic dialogue of the",
  "deaf\u2019. Nixon said that the US would not be a party to the overthrow of Yahya",
  "Khan, and warned India that \u2018the consequences of military action were in-",
  "calculably dangerous\u2019. Mrs Gandhi answered that it was the Pakistanis who",
  "spoke of waging a \u2018holy war\u2019. She also pointed out that while the West",
  "Pakistanis had \u2018dealt with the Bengali people in a treacherous and deceitful",
  "way and . . . always relegated them to an inferior role\u2019, India, \u2018on the other",
  "hand, has always reflected a degree of forbearance toward its own separatist",
  "elements\u2019.35",
  "While Mrs Gandhi was away, the conflict had intensified. From the end",
  "of October the shelling along the border became more fierce, encouraged by",
  "the Indian army, which saw the exchanges as a cover for insurgents to creep",
  "in and out. By the third week of November heavy artillery was in action. In a",
  "battle on the 21st the Pakistanis were said to have lost up to thirteen tanks.36",
  "Reporting this to Nixon, Yahya Khan complained that India had \u2018chosen the",

  "vour of the Indians, as was the support of the local population; this to add to",
  "an overwhelming superiority in numbers.The Indian army moved towards Dacca from four different directions.",
  "The delta was criss-crossed by rivers, but the Mukti Bahini knew where best",
  "to lay bridges, and which town housed what kind of enemy contingent. The",
  "Bahini was in turn helped by their civilian comrades: as the Pakistani Com-",
  "mander was to recall later, \u2018the Indian Army knew of all our battle positions,",
  "down to the last bunker, through the locals\u2019.42 Their path thus smoothed, the",
  "Indians made swift progress. Communications were snapped between Dacca",
  "and the other main city, Chittagong. Vital rail heads were captured, rendering",
  "the defenders immobile.43",
  "On 6 December the government of India officially revealed an intention",
  "it had long nurtured \u2013 namely, to support and catalyse the formation of a new",
  "nation-state to replace the old East Pakistan. On this day it formally recog-",

  "In Mujibur Rahman\u2019s absence, Syed Nazrul Islam served as acting president",
  "of the new state; he had a full-fledged Cabinet in tow. These men were to the",
  "Indians as de Gaulle\u2019s Free French forces had been to the Allies; waiting, not",
  "very patiently, while Big Brother recaptured their beloved city and handed it",

  "from the north, south and east. A temporary hiccup was provided by an air-",
  "craft carrier of the American 7th Fleet, which moved into the Bay of Bengal,",
  "by means \u2013 to quote Henry Kissinger \u2013 of \u2018registering our position\u2019.44",
  "The threat was an idle one. Tied down in Vietnam, the Americans could",
  "scarcely jump into another war which might \u2013 given the Indo-Soviet Treaty \u2013",
  "get horribly out of hand. As the collapse of Dacca became imminent, an ar-",
  "gument broke out between East Pakistan\u2019s civilian governor, who wanted to",
  "surrender, and the general in command of the besieged troops, who wanted to",
  "fight on. On 9 December, the governor sent a telegram to Islamabad asking",
  "them to sue for an \u2018immediate ceasefire and political settlement\u2019. Otherwise,",
  "\u2018once Indian troops are free from East Wing in a few days even West Wing",
  "will be in jeopardy\u2019. He considered the \u2018sacrifice of West Pakistan meaning-",
  "less\u2019, noting that \u2018General Niazi does not agree as he considers that his orders",
  "are to fight to the last and it would amount to giving up Dhaka\u2019.45",
  "The governor\u2019s views were independently confirmed by Pakistan\u2019s two",
  "main allies, China and the United States. On the 10th, Kissinger met ambas-",
  "sadorHuangHuainWashington.TheChinesediplomatbitterlyremarkedthat",
  "the creation of Bangladesh would create a \u2018new edition of Manchukuo\u2019, an",

  "China. Kissinger replied that \u2018it is our judgement, with great sorrow, that thePakistanarmyintwoweekswilldisintegrateintheWestasithasdisintegrated",
  "in the East\u2019. \u2018We are looking for a way to protect what is left of Pakistan,\u2019 he",
  "said, adding by way of consolation, \u2018We will not recognize Bangla Desh. We",
  "will not negotiate with Bangla Desh.\u201946",
  "On the night of the 13th, the Indians bombed the house of the governor",
  "in Dacca. The same night Niazi received a message from Yahya Khan advis-",
  "inghimtolaydownarms,as\u2018furtherresistanceisnothumanlypossible\u2019.The",

  "convey a message to New Delhi. The next day, the 16th, Lieutenant General",
  "J. S. Aurora of the Indian army\u2019s Eastern Command flew into Dacca to ac-",
  "cept asigned instrument ofsurrender.47That same evening the prime minister",
  "made an announcement in the Lok Sabha that \u2018Dacca is now the free capital",

  "where she announced a unilateral ceasefire on the western front. Twenty-four",
  "hourslaterGeneralYahyaKhanspokeovertheradio,sayinghehadinstructed",
  "his troops to cease firing as well.49",
  "The war had lasted a little less than two weeks. The Indians claimed to",
  "have lost 42 aircraft against Pakistan\u2019s 86, and 81 tanks against their 226.50",
  "But by far the largest disparity was in the number of prisoners. In the western",
  "sector, each side took a few thousand POWs, but in the east the Indians had",
  "now to take charge of around 90,000 Pakistani soldiers.",
  "Less than pleased with the outcome of the war was President Richard",
  "Nixon. \u2018The Indians are bastards anyway\u2019, he told Henry Kissinger. \u2018Pakistan",
  "thing makes your heartsick\u2019, he said. \u2018For them to be done so by the Indians",
  "and after we had warned the bitch.\u2019 Nixon wondered whether, when Mrs",
  "GandhihadvisitedWashingtoninNovember,hehadnotbeen\u2018tooeasyonthe",
  "goddamn woman\u2019 \u2013 it seems to have been a mistake to have \u2018really slobbered",
  "over the old witch\u2019. By this time even Kissinger had been turned off the",
  "Indians. He was cross with himself for having underestimated their milit-",
  "ary strength \u2013 \u2018The Indians are such poor pilots they can\u2019t even get off the",
  "ground,\u2019 he had claimed in October. His hope now was that \u2018the liberals are",
  "going to look like jerks because the Indian occupation of East Pakistan is go-",
  "ing to make the Pakistani one look like child\u2019s play.\u201951",
  "As for the American press, Time magazine even-handedly blamed both",
  "sides; Yahya\u2019s \u2018murderous rampage against rebellious Bengalis\u2019, along withIndira\u2019s launching of \u2018full-scale warfare\u2019, had together \u2018brought more suffer-",
  "ing to the sub-continent\u2019. However, the influential New York Times columnist",
  "James (Scotty) Reston took a more partisan line, writing a brooding, almost",
  "conspiratorial piece which saw the Soviet Union as the real beneficiary from",
  "\u2018this squalid tragedy\u2019. Its new ally India would \u2018provide access to Moscow\u2019s",

  "of bases in India\u2019, claimed Reston. He thought this country\u2019s experiment with",
  "democracy was in peril, wondering whether \u2018India will be able to encourage",
  "independence for one faction in Pakistan without encouraging independence",
  "for other factions in India itself, including the powerful Communist faction in",

  "of India the nation, but of India the land mass and demographic entity. In the",
  "first half of the second millennium a succession of foreign armies had come",
  "in through the north-west passage to plunder and conquer. Later rulers were",
  "Christian rather than Muslim, and came by sea rather than overland. Most re-",
  "cently, there had been that crushing defeat at the hands of the Chinese. For",
  "so long used to humiliation and defeat, Indians could at last savour the sweet",
  "smell of military success.",
  "On the other side of the border the view was all too different. After the",
  "news came that their troops had surrendered, an Urdu newspaper in Lahore",
  "wrote that \u2018today the entire nation weeps tears of blood . . . Today the Indian",
  "Army has entered Dacca. Today for the first time in 1,000 years Hindus have",
  "wonavictoryoverMuslims...Todayweareprostratewithdejection.\u2019With-",
  "in days, however, the Urdu press was seeking consolation from the lessons",

  "even the great Muhammad of Ghori had lost his first war in the subcontinent.",
  "But as another Lahore newspaper reminded its readers, Ghori had come back",

  "In India, credit for the victory was shared by countless mostly unnamed",
  "soldiers and a single specific politician \u2013 the prime minister. Mrs Gandhi wasadmired for standing up to the bullying tactics of the United States, and for",
  "so coolly planning the dismemberment of the enemy. Her parliamentary col-",
  "leagues went overboard in their salutations, but even opposition politicians",
  "were now speaking of her as \u2018Durga\u2019, the all-conquering goddess of Hindu",
  "mythology. The intellectual and professional classes, usually so sceptical of",

  "the events of that year, \u2018the old image of peace is being replaced by the new",
  "one of power. The old image only elicited patronizing smiles; the new image",
  "commands attention, and respect.\u2019 Then the diplomat G. L. Mehta claimed",
  "that \u2018the people have a new sense of self-confidence and not an unreason-",
  "able pride over its newly won prestige in the world\u2019. The left-wing journalist",
  "Romesh Thapar concurred: the \u2018success of the Bangla Desh policy\u2019, he re-",
  "marked, had given \u2018the thinking Indian a sense of achievement and power\u2019.",
  "The left-wing jurist V. R. Krishna Iyer saw in the recent events a progressive",
  "maturation of Indian leadership: \u2018What in Gandhian days was a vague creed",
  "was spelt out in Nehru\u2019s time as an activist social philosophy, and became,",
  "under Mrs Gandhi\u2019s leadership, a concrete and dynamic programme of gov-",
  "ernmental action.\u201955",
  "Away from India, Mrs Gandhi\u2019s calmness in a crisis was also admired",
  "by a woman who had seen some history in her time, the philosopher Hannah",
  "Arendt. In early November Arendt met the prime minister at the home of a",
  "mutual friend in New York. A month later, with Indian troops advancing on",
  "Dacca, she wrote to the novelist Mary McCarthy of how, at that party, she",
  "saw Mrs Gandhi, \u2018very good-looking, almost beautiful, very charming, flirt-",
  "ing with very man in the room, without chichi, and entirely calm \u2013 she must",
  "have known already that she was going to make war and probably enjoyed it",
  "even in a perverse way. The toughness of these women once they have got",
  "what they want is really something!\u2019 56VII",
  "The prime minister, and her party, naturally sought to make political capital",
  "of what the soldiers had accomplished. In March 1972 fresh elections were",
  "called in thirteen states, some of which had opposition governments; others,",
  "uneasyCongress-ledcoalitions.Inallthirteen,theCongresswoncomfortably.",

  "However,inatleastonestatethepresenceandexampleoftheprimemin-",

  "with resort to a mixture of terror, intimidation and fraud. Gangs of hooligans",

  "of New Delhi.",
  "Her domestic rule secured, the prime minister turned her attention to a",
  "settlement with Pakistan. Yahya Khan had resigned, and Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto",
  "stepped in to take his place. Bhutto told the former British prime minister Sir",
  "Alec Douglas-Home that he was keen to forge \u2018an entirely new relationship",
  "withIndia\u2019,beginningwithasummitmeetingwithMrsGandhi.Themessage",
  "was passed on, with the advice that in view of Pakistan\u2019s wounded pride, the",
  "invitation should come from India.59",
  "The Indians were at first apprehensive, given Bhutto\u2019s unpredictability",
  "and history of animosity against India. Confidants of the Pakistani president",
  "rushed to assure them of his good intentions. The economist Mahbub ul Haq",
  "told an Indian counterpart that Bhutto was now \u2018in a very chastened and real-",
  "istic mood\u2019.60 The journalist Mazhar Ali Khan, editor of Dawn, told his fel-",

  "would be disastrous for both India and Pakistan.61",
  "ZaheerandKhanhadworkedtogetherinpre-Partitiondaysasfellowact-",
  "ivists of the Student Federation of India. Now, encouraged by their formerfellow-traveller P. N. Haksar, they met in London in the third week of March",
  "1972 to discuss the terms of a possible agreement between their two national",
  "leaders. Khan\u2019s suggestions included are turn of all Pakistani POWs in return",
  "for its recognition of Bangladesh, troop withdrawal to positions held before",

  "said that the dispute should \u2018not be mentioned at all in the declaration as this",

  "ance that there will be no more attack, infiltration, subversion, anti-India pro-",

  "them via P. N. Haksar to Mrs Gandhi. The Pakistani president was invited",
  "for a summit to beheld in the old imperial summer capital of Simla in the",
  "last week of June 1972. He came accompanied by his daughter Benazir and",
  "a fairly large staff. First the officials met, and then their leaders. The Indians",
  "wanted a comprehensive treaty to settle all outstanding problems (including",
  "Kashmir); the Pakistanis preferred a piece meal approach. At a private meet-",
