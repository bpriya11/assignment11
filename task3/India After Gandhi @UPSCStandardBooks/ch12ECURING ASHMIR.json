  "As we have seen in Chapter 4, by 1949 Sheikh Abdullah was in firm con-",
  "troloftheadministration ofJammu andKashmir.Butthestatus oftheterritory",
  "was still under dispute. The United Nations had called for a plebiscite and was",
  "trying to get India and Pakistan to meet the conditions for holding it.",
  "In February 1950 the UN Security Council asked both countries to with-",
  "draw their armies from the state. As before, both sides stalled. India asked for",
  "the Pakistanis to take their troops out first while Pakistan demanded that the",
  "National Conference government be removed from office. India had begun to",
  "regret taking the matter to the United Nations in the first place. By 1950 it was",
  "quite prepared to hold on to its part of the disputed state, and let Pakistan take",
  "thehindmost.TheIndianConstitution,whichcameintoeffectinJanuary1950,",
  "treated Kashmir as part of the Indian Union. However, it guaranteed the state",
  "a certain autonomy; thus Article 370 specified that the president would consult",
  "thestategovernmentwithregardtosubjectsotherthandefence,foreignaffairs,",
  "and communications.1AsforPakistan,politicians thereheldthattheirclaimneedednocertific-",
  "ation from a popular vote. In September 1950 a former prime minister insis-",
  "ted that \u2018the liberation of Kashmir is a cardinal belief of every Pakistani . . .",
  "Pakistan would remain incomplete until the whole of Kashmir has been liber-",
  "ated\u2019. Two weeks later, a serving prime minister observed that \u2018for Pakistan,",
  "Kashmir is a vital necessity; for India it is an imperialistic adventure\u2019.2",
  "On both sides of the border the governmental positions were echoed and",
  "amplified by the press. In the summer of 1950 the British broadcaster Lionel",
  "Fieldenvisitedthesubcontinent.AsaformerheadofAll-IndiaRadio,Fielden",
  "had many friends in both India and Pakistan. Visiting them and speaking also",
  "to their friends, he found that on either side of the international boundary \u2018the",
  "visitor is assailed by arguments and harangues to prove that the other country",
  "is not only wrong but diabolically wrong, and mischievously to boot\u2019. He ob-",
  "servedthat\u2018thetoneoftheIndianPresstendstobealittlepatronizing,sweetly",
  "reasonable but nevertheless obstinate, and rather consciously self-righteous\u2019.",
  "On the other hand, \u2018the tone of the Pakistan Press and Pakistan leaders tends",
  "to be resentful, arrogant and sometimes aggressive\u2019. Pakistani hostility was",
  "compounded by the fear that powerful forces in India wanted to reconquer or",
  "reabsorb their land in a united Akhand Bharat.",
  "Fielden summarized the respective points of view: \u2018In clinging to Kash-",
  "mir, India wants to weaken Partition; in claiming it, Pakistan wants to make",
  "Partition safe.\u2019 On the issue of Kashmir both sides were absolutely rigid.",
  "Thus, \u2018to fight to the last ditch for [Kashmir] is the slogan of all Pakistanis;",
  "not to give way on it is rapidly becoming the fixed idea in India.\u2019",
  "Fielden ended his analysis with a warning. In the long run, he pointed",
  "out, \u2018the most important thing\u2019 about the Kashmir conflict was \u2018the expense",
  "in armaments in which both countries are getting involved. This means that",
  "social services in both countries are crippled, and since both countries, apart",
  "fromtheirrefugees,havemillionsofthepoorestpeopleintheworld,itiseasy",
  "to see how this can lead to disaster.\u20193",
  "The United Nations had tried and failed to solve the dispute. Could an-",
  "other \u2018third party\u2019 succeed? In January 1951, at a meeting at 10 Downing",
  "Street, the Australian Prime Minister Sir Robert Menzies suggested that a",
  "plebiscitebeheldunderCommonwealthauspices.TheBritishprimeminister,",
  "Clement Attlee, appeared to favour the idea, but Nehru said any settlement",
  "must have the concurrence of the state government of Sheikh Abdullah. The",
  "Pakistani prime minister dismissed that government as \u2018puppets appointed by",
  "Nehru [whom] he could change any time\u2019. In reply, Nehru noted that \u2018the",
  "Pakistan press was full of this religious appeal and calls for Jehad. If this wasthe kind of thing that was going to take place during a plebiscite, then there",
  "would be no plebiscite but civil upheaval, not only in Kashmir, but elsewhere",
  "in India and Pakistan.\u20194",

  "to which the man himself would not give a straight answer. His vacillation is",
  "captured in a series of frustrated letters written by Nehru to his sister Vijay-",

  "10 May 1950. I am sorry to say that Sheikh Abdullah is behaving in a",
  "most irresponsible manner. The most difficult thing in life is what to do",
  "with one\u2019s friends.",
  "18 July 1950. Meanwhile, Sheikh Abdullah has been behaving very",

  "be of immense value in the struggle against communism?",
  "We still can\u2019t say, and it seems Abdullah was equally unsure at the time,",
  "for he now went back to the Indian government to negotiate with them the",
  "terms of Kashmir\u2019s autonomy. The state, it was decided, would have its own",
  "constituent assembly, where the terms by which it would associate with In-",
  "dia would be finalized. In January 1951 Abdullah wrote to the minister of",
  "statesthat,asheunderstoodit,theJammuandKashmirConstituentAssembly",

  "or abolition of the Ruler as the Constitutional Head of the State and the ques-",

  "would\u2018takedecisionsonallissuesspecifiedabove\u2019,decisionsthegovernment",
  "of India must treat as \u2018binding on all concerned\u2019. This suggested that even",
  "Kashmir\u2019s accession to India was not final. As an alarmed minister of states",
  "notedinthemarginsoftheletter,theSheikh\u2019sinterpretation was\u2018perhapsgo-",
  "ing beyond what we said\u2019.7",
  "TheSheikh,asever,presumedtospeakforthestateofJammuandKash-",
  "mir as a whole. In truth, while he was still revered in the Valley, he was be-",
  "coming quite unpopular among the Hindu of the Jammu region, who were",
  "keen to merge their part of the state with the Indian Union as quickly as pos-",
  "sible. In 1949 a Praja Parishad (Peoples\u2019 Party) was formed to represent the",
  "interestsoftheJammuHindus.Itwasledbyaseventy-year-oldveteran,PremNath Dogra. Characteristically, Sheikh Abdullah dismissed the opposition in",
  "Jammu as a bunch of \u2018reactionaries\u2019.8",
  "In October 1951 elections were held to the Kashmir Constituent",
  "Assembly.ThePrajaParishadhaddecidedtocontestbut,earlyon,thenomin-",
  "ation papers of several of their candidates were found to be invalid. In protest",
  "they chose to boycott the election. All seventy-five seats were won by Ab-",
  "dullah\u2019s National Conference. All but three of their candidates were returned",
  "unopposed.9",
  "Sheikh Abdullah\u2019s opening speech in the Constituent Assembly ran for",
  "a full ninety minutes. Reading from a printed English text, the Sheikh dis-",
  "cussed,onebyone,theoptionsbeforethepeopleofKashmir.Thefirstwasto",
  "join Pakistan, that \u2018landlord-ridden\u2019 and \u2018feudal\u2019 theocracy. The second was",
  "to join India, with whom the state had a \u2018kinship of ideals\u2019 and whose gov-",
  "ernment had \u2018never tried to interfere in our internal autonomy\u2019. Admittedly,",
  "\u2018certain tendencies have been asserting themselves in India which may in the",
  "future convert it into a religious State wherein the interests of the Muslims",
  "will be jeopardized\u2019. On the other hand, \u2018the continued accession of Kashmir",
  "to India\u2019 would promote harmony between Hindus and Muslims, and margin-",
  "alize the communalists. \u2018Gandhiji was not wrong\u2019, argued the Sheikh, \u2018when",
  "he uttered words before his death which [I] paraphrase: \u201cI lift up mine eyes",
  "unto the hills, from whence cometh my help\u201d.\u2019",
  "Abdullah came, finally, to \u2018the alternative of making ourselves an",
  "Eastern Switzerland, of keeping aloof from both States, but having friendly",
  "relationswiththem\u2019.Thiswasanattractiveoption,butitdidnotseempractic-",
  "al. How would a small, landlocked country safeguard its sovereignty? As the",
  "Sheikh reminded his audience, Kashmir had once been \u2018independent\u2019 of both",
  "India and Pakistan; between 15 August and 22 October 1947, when its inde-",
  "pendence had been destroyed by the tribal invasion. What was the guarantee",
  "that a sovereign Kashmir \u2018may not be victim of a similar aggression\u2019?10",
  "Thus, the Sheikh rejected the option of independence as impractical, and",
  "theoptionofjoiningPakistanasimmoral.TheywouldjoinIndia,butonterms",
  "of their own choosing. Among these terms were the retention of the state flag",
  "and the designation of the head of government as prime minister. Neither was",
  "acceptable to the Praja Parishad of Jammu. Asking for the complete integ-",
  "ration of Kashmir into India, they had adopted the slogan: \u2018Ek Vidhan, ek",
  "Pradhan, ek Nishan\u2019 (One Constitution, One Head of State, One Flag).",
  "In January 1952, shortly before Abdullah was due to speak in Jammu",
  "town, Hindu students protested against the National Conference flag being",
  "flown alongside the Indian tricolour. They were arrested and later expelledfromtheircollege.Thissparkedawaveofsympathyprotestsculminatingina",

  "their aged leader, Prem Nath Dogra, although he had not participated in the",

  "The government in Delhi, fearful of a countrywide Hindu backlash, per-",
  "suaded the Kashmir government to release the Parishad leaders. Abdullah",
  "agreed,ifreluctantly.On10Aprilhemadeaspeechinwhichhesaidhisparty",
  "would accept the Indian Constitution \u2018in its entirety once we are satisfied that",
  "the grave of communalism has been finally dug\u2019. He darkly added: \u2018Of that",
  "we are not sure yet. The Sheikh said that the Kashmiris \u2018fear what will hap-",
  "pen to them and their position if, for instance, something happens to Pandit",
  "Nehru\u2019.11",
  "Both the timing and venue of Abdullah\u2019s speech were significant. It",
  "was made in Ranbirsinghpura, a town only four miles from the border with",
  "Pakistan. And India had just come through a general election the result of",
  "which appeared to vindicate Jawaharlal Nehru and his policies. The speech",
  "was widely reported, and caused considerable alarm. Why was the man who",
  "hadoftenissuedchitscomplimentingIndiaforitssecularismsuddenlyturning",
  "so sceptical?",
  "The Sheikh\u2019s change of mind coincided with a visit to Kashmir by the",
  "veteran British journalist Ian Stephens. Stephens, who had been editor of the",
  "Calcutta Statesman during the troubles of 1946\u20137, was known to be a strong",
  "supporter of Pakistan. He thought that the Kashmir Valley, with its majority",
  "Muslim population, properly belonged to that country. Still, he was sensitive",
  "to the dilemmas of its leader. He had long talks with Abdullah, whom he saw",
  "as \u2018a man of pluck and enlightenment, standing for principles good in their",
  "way; a victim, like so many of us, of the unique scope and speed and confu-",
  "sion of the changes in 1947, and now holding a perhaps uniquely lonely and",
  "perplexing post\u2019. His was a regime upheld by \u2018Indian bayonets, which meant",
  "mainly Hindu bayonets\u2019. Admittedly, \u2018in many ways it was a good regime:",
  "energetic, full of ideas, staunchly non-communal, very go-ahead in agrarian",
  "reform\u2019. But, concluded Stephens, \u2018to the eye of history it might prove an un-",
  "natural one\u2019.12",
  "IIIOnce, Abdullah had been Nehru\u2019s man in Kashmir. By the summer of 1952,",
  "however, it was more that Nehru was Abdullah\u2019s man in India. The Sheikh",
  "had made it known that, in his view, only the prime minister stood between",
  "India and the ultimate victory of Hindu communalism.",
  "Meanwhile, discussions continued about the precise status of Kashmir",
  "vis-\u00e0-vistheIndianUnion.InJulytheSheikhmetNehruinDelhiandalsohad",
  "a round of meetings with other ministers. They hammered out a compromise",
  "known as the Delhi Agreement, whereby Kashmiris would become full cit-",
  "izens of India in exchange for an autonomy far greater than that enjoyed by",
  "other states of the Union. Thus the new state flag (devised by the National",
  "Conference) would for \u2018historical and other reasons\u2019 be flown alongside the",
  "national flag. Delhi could not send in forces to quell \u2018internal disturbances\u2019",
  "without the consent of Srinagar. Where with regard to other states residuary",
  "powersrestedwiththecentre,inthecaseofKashmirthesewouldremainwith",
  "the state. Crucially, those from outside the state were prohibited from buying",
  "land or property within it. This measure was aimed at forestalling attempts",
  "to change the demographic profile of the Valley through large-scale immigra-",
  "tion.13",
  "Theseweremajorconcessions,buttheSheikhpressedforgreaterpowers",

  "ness and sorrow of the common man\u2019. For \u2018if he is under the delusion that he",
  "can retain his office with the help of his few supporters, he is mistaken\u2019.14",
  "The \u2018reactionary elements\u2019 referred to here were the Hindus of Jammu.",
  "They had restarted their agitation, with an amended if equally catchy slogan:",
  "\u2018Ek Desh mein Do Vidhan, Do Pradhan, Do Nishan \u2013 nahin chalenge, nahin",
  "chalenge\u2019 (Two Constitutions, Two Heads of State, Two Flags \u2013 these in one",
  "State we shall not allow, not allow). Processions and marches, as well as",
  "clashes with police, became frequent. Once more the jails of Jammu began to",
  "fill with the volunteers of the Praja Parishad.",
  "The Hindus of Jammu retained a deep attachment to the ruling family,",
  "andtoMaharajaHariSinghinparticular.Theyresentedhisbeingdeposedand",
  "were displeased with his son for being \u2018disloyal\u2019 by agreeing to replace him.",
  "But their apprehensions were also economic-namely,that the land reforms re-",
  "cently undertaken in the Kashmir Valley would be reproduced in Jammu. Inthe Valley, zamindars had been dispossessed of land in excess of the ceiling",
  "limit. Since this was fixed at twenty-two acres per family, their losses were",
  "substantial. The land seized by the state had been vested chiefly in the hands",
  "ofthemiddlepeasantry.Theagricultural proletariat hadnotbenefited toquite",
  "the same extent. Still, the land reforms had gone further and been more suc-",
  "cessful than anywhere else in India.15",
  "As it happened, the large landlords in the Valley were almost all Hindu.",
  "This gave an unfortunate religious hue to what was essentially a project of",
  "socialist redistribution. This was perhaps inevitable; despite the sincerity of",
  "the Sheikh\u2019s secularist professions, they could not nullify the legacies of his-",
  "tory. At one time the state had been controlled by the Dogras of Jammu, who",
  "happened to be Hindu; now it was controlled by the National Conference,",
  "whichwasbasedintheValleyandwhoseleaderandmostofitsmemberswere",
  "Muslim.16",
  "IV",
  "Throughtheyears1950\u20132,astherestofIndiabecameacquaintedwithitsnew",
  "constitution and had its first elections, Jammu and Kashmir was beset by un-",
  "certainty on two fronts. There were the unsettled relations between the state",
  "and the Union, and there was the growing conflict between the Muslim-ma-",
  "jority Kashmir Valley and the Hindu-dominated Jammu region. Here was a",
  "situation made to order for a politician in search of a cause. And it found one",
  "in Dr Syama Prasad Mookerjee, who was to make the struggle of the Dogras",
  "of Jammu his own.",
  "Dr Mookerjee had left Jawaharlal Nehru\u2019s Cabinet to become the",
  "founder-president of the Bharatiya Jana Sangh. His new party fared poorly at",
  "thegeneralelectionof1952\u2013onlythreeofitsmemberswereelectedtoParlia-",
  "ment. The troubles in Kashmir came at an opportune time for Dr Mookerjee",
  "and the Jana Sangh. Here was a chance to lift the dispirited cadres, to forget",
  "the disappointments of the election and reinvent the party on the national",
  "stage.",
  "Dr Mookerjee began his charge with a series of blistering attacks on the",
  "government in Parliament. \u2018Who made Sheikh Abdullah the King of Kings",
  "in Kashmir?\u2019 he asked sarcastically. The Sheikh had apparently said that they",
  "wouldtreatboththeprovincialandnationalflags\u2018equally\u2019;this,saidtheJana",
  "Sangh leader, showed a \u2018divided loyalty\u2019 unacceptable in a sovereign coun-try. Even if the Valley wanted a limited accession, Jammu and the Buddhist",
  "region of Ladakh must be allowed to integrate fully if they so chose. But a",
  "better solution still would be to make the whole state a part of India, without",
  "any special concessions. This would bring it on par with all the other princely",
  "states, which \u2013 despite earlier promises made to them as regards autonomy \u2013",
  "had finally to agree to be subject to the provisions of the constitution in toto.",

  "In the autumn of 1952 Dr Mookerjee visited Jammu and made several",

  "Which, of course, is what Sheikh Abdullah was disposed to do. Through",
  "the winter of 1952/3 the Praja Parishad and the state government remained",
  "locked in conflict. Protesters would remove the state flag from government",
  "buildings and place Indian flags in their stead. They would be arrested, but",

  "become a repressive ruler himself.20",
  "InJanuaryDrSyama PrasadMookerjee wrotealongletter toJawaharlal",
  "Nehru in support of the Parishad and their \u2018highly patriotic and emotional",

  "thepossessionofPakistan.HowwasIndia\u2018goingtogetthis[territory]back\u2019?asked Mookerjee. \u2018You have always evaded this question. The time has come",
  "when we should know what exactly you propose to do about this matter. It",
  "will be nothing short of national disgrace and humiliation if we fail to regain",
  "this lost portion of our own territory.\u2019",
  "Nehru ignored the taunt. As for the Praja Parishad, he thought that they",
  "were\u2018tryingtodecideaverydifficultandcomplicatedconstitutionalquestion",
  "by methods of war\u2019. Abdullah (to whom Mookerjee had written separately)",
  "wasmoreblunt;ashesawit,\u2018thePrajaParishadisdeterminedtoforceasolu-",

  "Mookerjee asked Nehru and Abdullah to release the Praja Parishad lead-",

  "again challenged Nehru to go to war with Pakistan: \u2018Please do not sidetrack",
  "theissueandletthepublicofIndiaknowhowandwhen,ifatall,wearegoing",
  "to get back this portion of our cherished territory.21",
  "Eventually the exchange ran a ground on a matter of pride. Nehru",
  "thought the Parishad should call off the movement as a precondition to talks",
  "with the government; Mookerjee wanted the government to offer talks as a",
  "precondition to the movement calling off the struggle. When the government",
  "refused to bend, Mookerjee decided to take the matter to the streets of Delhi.",
  "Beginning in the first week of March, Jana Sangh volunteers courted arrest",
  "in support of the demands of the Praja Parishad. The protesters would collect",
  "outside a police station and shout slogans against the government and against",
  "the prime minister, thereby violating Section 188 of the Indian Penal Code.",
  "The satyagraha was co-ordinated by Dr Mookerjee from his office in",
  "Parliament House. Participating were members of what the authorities were",
  "calling the \u2018Hindu communal parties\u2019: the Jana Sangh, the Hindu Mahasabha",
  "andtheRamRajyaParishad.BytheendofApril19531,300peoplehadbeen",

  "yet were overwhelmingly upper caste: Brahmins, Thakurs, Banias.22",
  "It was nowsummer,tourist season in the Valley.Among the first visitors",
  "to arrive, in late April, was the American politician Adlai Stevenson. He had",
  "come to Kashmir to sail on the Dal lake and see the snows, but also to meet",
  "Sheikh Abdullah. They met twice, for upwards of two hours each time. The",
  "content of these conversations were not revealed by either side, but some In-",
  "dians assumed it was all about independence. A Bombay journal otherwise",
  "known to be sympathetic to the United States claimed that Stevenson had",
  "assured Abdullah of much more than moral support. A loan of $15 million",
  "would be on hand once Kashmir became independent; besides, the US would",
  "ensure that \u2018the Valley would have a permanent population of at least 5,000American families, that every houseboat and hotel would be filled to capa-",
  "city,that Americans wouldbuyupall the art andcraft output ofthe dexterous",
  "Kashmiri artisans, that within three years every village in Kashmir would be",
  "electrified and so on and so forth\u2019.23",

  "Not long after Stevenson, another politician came seeking to fish in troubled",
  "waters. On 8 May Dr Syama Prasad Mookerjee boarded a train to Jammu,",
  "en route to Srinagar. He had planned to take his satyagraha deep into enemy",
  "territory. Anticipating trouble, the state government issued orders prohibiting",
  "him from entering. Mookerjee disregarded the order and crossed the border",
  "on the morning of the 11th. The police requested him to return, and when he",
  "refused arrested him and took him to Srinagar jail.",
  "Before the Praja Parishad movement, Dr Mookerjee had been a lifelong",
  "constitutionalist. A Bengali bhadralok of the old school, he was comfortable",

  "ishad. And now he was sanctioning and leading a street protest himself.Why then did Dr Mookerjee resort to methods with which he was un-",
  "familiar? He told his follower (and future biographer) Balraj Madhok that he",
  "was convinced that this was the only language the prime minister understood.",

  "their old friendship and India\u2019s ties to Kashmir. He asked Abdullah to come",
  "down to Delhi and meet him. The Sheikh did not oblige. Then Nehru sent",
  "Maulana Abul Kalam Azad (the most senior member of the Cabinet) to Srin-",
  "agar, but that did not help either. The Sheikh now seemed convinced of two",

  "ernment of India, he said that \u2018a time will, therefore, come when I will bid",
  "them good-bye\u2019.33",
  "The Sheikh\u2019s turnabout greatly alarmed the prime minister. Writing to a",
  "colleague, Nehru said the developments in Kashmir were particularly unfor-",
  "tunate, for \u2018anything that happens there has larger and wider consequences\u2019.",
  "For the \u2018problem of Kashmir [was] symbolic of many things, including our",
  "secular policy in India\u2019.34",
  "By now the government of Kashmir was divided within itself, its mem-",
  "bers (as Nehru observed), liable \u2018to pull in different directions and proclaim",
  "entirely different policies\u2019. This was in good part the work of the government",
  "ofIndia\u2019sIntelligenceBureau.OfficersoftheBureauhadbeenworkingwith-",
  "in the National Conference, dividing the leadership and confusing the ranks.",
  "Some leaders, such as G. M. Sadiq, were left-wing anti-Americans; they dis-",
  "approved of the Sheikh\u2019s talks with Stevenson. Others, like Bakshi Ghulam",
  "Mohammed, had ambitions of ruling Kashmir themselves.35",
  "There was now an open rift within the National Conference between the",
  "pro-India and pro-independence groups. The latter were led by the Sheikh\u2019s",
  "close associate Mirza Afzal Beg. The former were in close touch with the",
  "sadr-i-riyasat, Karan Singh. It was rumoured that Sheikh Abdullah would de-",
  "clare independence on 21 August \u2013 the day of the great Id festival \u2013 follow-",
  "ing which he would seek the protection of the United Nations against \u2018Indian",
  "aggression\u2019.36 Two weeks before that date Abdullah dismissed a member of",
  "his Cabinet. This gave the others in the pro-India faction an excuse to move",
  "against him. Led by Bakshi Ghulam Mohammed, they wrote the Sheikh a let-",
  "ter accusing him of encouraging sectarianism and corruption. A copy of theletter was also sent to Karan Singh. He, in turn, dismissed Abdullah and in-",
  "vited Bakshi Ghulam Mohammed to form a government in his place.",
  "Abdullah was served his walking papers in the early hours of the morn-",
  "ing. When he was woken up and handed the letter of dismissal, the Sheikh",
  "flew into a rage. \u2018Who is the sadr-i-riyasat to dismiss me?\u2019, he shouted. \u2018I",
  "made that chit of a boy sadr-i-riyasat.\u2019 The police then told him that he had",
  "not just been dismissed, but also placed under arrest. He was given two hours",
  "to say his prayers and pack his belongings before being taken off to jail.",
  "Why was Abdullah humiliated so? Did he have to be dismissed in the",
  "deadofnight,anddidhethenhavetobeplacedunderdetention?KaranSingh",
  "later recalled that this was done because \u2018Bakshi Ghulam Mohammed made",
  "it quite clear that he could not undertake to run the Government if the Sheikh",
  "and Beg were left free to propagate their views\u2019. In other words, he was safe",
  "and quiet in jail, whereas as a free man, put out of office, he would quickly",
  "mobilize popular sentiment in hisfavour.37",
  "Then, and later, it was widely believed that the arrest of Abdullah was",
  "masterminded by Rafi Ahmad Kidwai. Kidwai was a left-leaning member of",
  "theCabinet, andaclose friendofNehru\u2019s.InDelhi itwasthoughtthat hisde-",
  "siretohumiliatetheSheikhhaditsrootsinthefactthatAbdullahwascurrying",
  "favour with the Americans. In Kashmir, however, it was held that this was a",
  "plain, if misguided, act of revenge. Back in 1947 Kidwai\u2019s brother had been",
  "murderedbyaKashmiriinthehillstationofMussoorie.DeposingtheSheikh",
  "was away of settling accounts.38",
  "Did Jawaharlal Nehru himself sanction the arrest of his friend Sheikh",
  "Abdullah? Nehru\u2019s biographer thinks he did not know beforehand, whereas",
  "hischiefofintelligence suggestshedid.Onethingisclear,however:oncethe",
  "deed was done he did nothing to countermand it.39",
  "Like his predecessor, the new prime minister of Kashmir was a larger-",
  "than-life figure. He was known commonly as the Bakshi, much as his pre-",
  "decessor was known as the Sheikh. Born in 1907 in modest circumstances,",
  "Ghulam Mohammed began his political career by organizing a union of car-",
  "riage drivers in Srinagar. That, and four terms in Hari Singh\u2019s jails, gave him",
  "sterling nationalist credentials. However, by temperament and orientation he",
  "wasquitedifferentfromtheSheikh.Onewasamanofideasandidealism,the",
  "other a man of action and organization. When the raiders attacked in Octo-",
  "ber 1947, it was Abdullah who gave the rousing speeches while the Bakshi",
  "placed volunteers in position and watched out for potential fifth-columnists.",
  "After 1947, while Abdullah dealt with Nehru and Delhi, the Bakshi \u2018kept the",
  "structure of the State intact, at a time when the whole Government had col-lapsedandwasnon-existent\u2019.AstwoKashmiriacademicswrotein1950,\u2018be-",

  "The analogy, though attractive, was inexact. For Patel did not covet his",

  "as he well understood, keeping Delhi on his side. Ten days after he had as-",

  "them that \u2018the ties between Kashmir and India are irrevocable. No power on",
  "earthcanseparatethetwo.Next,speakinginSrinagartoameetingofNational",
  "Conference workers, the Bakshi argued that \u2018Sheikh Abdullah played direc-",
  "tly into the hands of foreign invaders by entertaining the idea of an independ-",
  "ent Kashmir\u2019.That, he said, was \u2018a dangerous game, pregnant with disastrous",
  "consequencesforKashmir,India,andPakistan\u2019.SinceKashmirlackedthere-",
  "sources to defend itself, independence was a \u2018crack-brained idea\u2019, calculated",
  "only to make the state a centre of superpower intrigue. It was an idea \u2018which",
  "can devastate the people\u2019.41",
  "As prime minister, Bakshi Ghulam Mohammed adopted a populist style,",
  "holding a darbar (court) every Friday, where he heard the grievances of the",
  "public. An early move was to raise the procurement price of paddy. Next, he",
  "madeschooleducationfree,sanctionednewengineeringandmedicalcolleges",
  "and abolished customs barriers between Jammu and Kashmir and the rest of",
  "India.",
  "In October 1954 the All-India Newspaper Editors Conference was held",
  "in Srinagar. The state government pulled out all the stops, placing the guests",
  "in the best hotels and throwing parties at which the finest Kashmiri delicacies",
  "were served. A grateful editor wrote that, although the new regime had been",
  "in place only for a year, \u2018it can be safely said that the Bakshi Government has",
  "in some fields, brought in more reforms than did Sheikh Abdullah\u2019s in its six",
  "years of existence\u2019. After the public and the press it was the turn of the pres-",

  "Within and outside Kashmir the Bakshi was viewed as something of a",
  "usurper. Relevant here are the contents of two secret police reports on Friday",
  "prayers in Delhi\u2019s Jama Masjid. On 2 October 1953 the prayers were atten-",
  "ded by two members of Parliament from Kashmir. When they were asked by",
  "a Muslim cleric to organize a meeting on the situation in Kashmir, the MPs",
  "answeredthatthetimewasnotright,fortheywereworkingbehindthescenes",

  "In the 1950s, as in the 1940s, the Valley of Kashmir was troubled and un-",
  "settled. Behind the troubles of the 1940s lay the indecision of the Maharaja",
  "\u2013 who refused to accede to either Pakistan or India while there was still time",
  "\u2013 and the greed and fervour of the tribal raiders who invaded the state. Be-",
  "hind the troubles of the 1950s were the ambitions of Sheikh Abdullah and S.",
  "P. Mookerjee. Neither was willing to play within the rules of constitutional",
  "democracy. Both raised the political stakes and both, tragically, paid for it.",
  "The developments in Kashmir were worrisome not just to Indians. The",
  "British general who had been in charge of the Indian army in 1947 thought",
  "that they might very well \u2018result in a worsening of Indo-Pak relations\u2019. In the",
