  "F I on 15 August 1947, but patriotic Indians had celebrated",
  "REEDOM CAME TO NDIA",
  "their first \u2018Independence Day\u2019 seventeen years before. In the first week of",
  "January 1930 the Indian National Congress passed a resolution fixing the last",
  "Sunday ofthe month forcountrywide demonstrations in support of purna swa-",
  "raj, or complete independence. This, it was felt, would both stoke nationalist",
  "aspirations and force the British seriously to consider giving up power. In an",
  "essay in his journal Young India, Mahatma Gandhi set out how the day should",
  "be observed. \u2018It would be good\u2019, said the leader, \u2018if the declaration [of inde-",
  "pendence] is made by whole villages, whole cities even . . . It would be well if",
  "all the meetings were held at the identical minute in all the places.\u2019Gandhi suggested that the time of the meeting be advertised in the tra-",
  "ditional way, by drum-beats. The celebrations would begin with the hoisting",
  "of the national flag. The rest of the day would be spent \u2018in doing some con-",
  "structive work, whether it is spinning, or service of \u201cuntouchables\u201d, or reuni-",
  "on of Hindus and Mussalmans, or prohibition work, or even all these togeth-",

  "prives a people of these rights and oppresses them, the people have a further",
  "right to alter it or abolish it\u2019.1",
  "Theresolution tomarkthelast SundayofJanuary1930asIndependence",
  "Day was passed in the city of Lahore, where the Congress was holding its an-",
  "nual session. It was here that Jawaharlal Nehru was chosen President of the",
  "Congress,inconfirmationofhisrapidlyrisingstatuswithintheIndiannation-",
  "al movement. Born in 1889, twenty years after Gandhi, Nehru was a product",
  "of Harrow and Cambridge who had become a close prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of the Mahatma.",
  "He was intelligent and articulate, knowledgeable about foreign affairs, and",
  "with a particular appeal to the young.",
  "In his autobiography Nehru recalled how \u2018Independence Day came,",
  "January 26th, 1930, and it revealed to us, as in a flash, the earnest and enthu-",
  "siastic mood of the country. There was something vastly impressive about the",
  "greatgatheringseverywhere,peacefullyandsolemnlytakingthepledgeofin-",
  "dependence without any speeches or exhortation.\u20192 In a press statement that",
  "he issued the day after, Nehru \u2018respectfully congratulate[d] the nation on the",
  "success of the solemn and orderly demonstrations\u2019. Towns and villages had",
  "\u2018vied with each other in showing their enthusiastic adherence to independen-",
  "ce\u2019.MammothgatheringswereheldinCalcuttaandBombay,butthemeetings",
  "in smaller towns were well attended too.3",
  "Every year after 1930, Congress-minded Indians celebrated 26 January",
  "asIndependenceDay.However,whentheBritishfinallyleftthesubcontinent,",
  "they chose to hand over power on 15 August 1947. This date was selected by",

  "cianswaitingtotakeoffice,wereunwillingtodelayuntilthedatesomeothers",
  "would have preferred \u2013 26 January 1948.",
  "So freedom finally came on a day that resonated with imperial pride",
  "rather than nationalist sentiment. In New Delhi, capital of the Raj and of free",
  "India, the formal events began shortly before midnight. Apparently, astrolo-",
  "gershaddecreedthat15Augustwasaninauspiciousday.Thusitwasdecidedtobeginthecelebrations onthe14th,withaspecial sessionoftheConstituent",

  "Council of the Raj. The room was brilliantly lit and decorated with flags.",
  "Someoftheseflagshadbeenplacedinsidepictureframesthatuntiltheprevi-",

  "and elsewhere\u2019. The ceremonies ended with the presentation of the national",
  "flag on behalf of the women of India.",
  "Between the hymn and the flag presentation came the speeches. There",
  "were three main speakers that night. One, Chaudhry Khaliquz-zaman, was",
  "chosen to represent the Muslims of India; he duly proclaimed the loyalty of",
  "the minority to the newly freed land. A second, the philosopher Dr Sarvepalli",
  "Radhakrishnan, was chosen for his powers of oratory and his work in recon-",
  "cilingEastandWest:appropriately,hepraisedthe\u2018politicalsagacityandcour-",
  "age\u2019 of the British who had elected to leave India while the Dutch stayed on",
  "in Indonesia and the French would not leave Indo-China.4",
  "The star turn, however, was that of the first prime minister of free India,",
  "Jawaharlal Nehru. His speech was rich in emotion and rhetoric, and has been",
  "widely quoted since. \u2018At the stroke of the midnight hour, when the world",
  "sleeps, India will awake to life and freedom,\u2019 said Nehru.5 This was \u2018a mo-",
  "ment which comes but rarely in history, when we step out from the old to the",
  "new, when an age ends, and when the soul of a nation, long suppressed, finds",
  "utterance\u2019.",
  "This was spoken inside the columned Council House. In the streets out-",
  "side, as an American journalist reported,",
  "bedlam had broken loose. Hindus, Muslims, and Sikhs were happily cel-",
  "ebratingtogether...ItwasTimesSquareonNewYear\u2019sEve.Morethan",

  "ferent exit and after a while the rest of us went out.No event of any importance in India is complete without a goof-up. In this",
  "case,itwasrelativelyminor.When,afterthemidnightsessionattheConstitu-",
  "ent Assembly, Jawaharlal Nehru went to submit his list of cabinet ministers",
  "to the governor general, he handed over an empty envelope. However, by the",
  "timeoftheswearing-inceremonythemissingpieceofpaperwasfound.Apart",
  "from Prime Minister Nehru, it listed thirteen other ministers. These included",
  "the nationalist stalwarts Vallabhbhai Patel and Maulana Abul Kalam Azad, as",
  "well as four Congress politicians of the younger generation.",
  "More notable perhaps were the names of those who were not from the",
  "Congress. These included two representatives of the world of commerce and",
  "one representative of the Sikhs. Three others were lifelong adversaries of the",
  "Congress.ThesewereR.K.ShanmukhamChetty,aMadrasbusinessmanwho",
  "possessedoneofthebestfinancialmindsinIndia;B.R.Ambedkar,abrilliant",
  "legal scholar and an \u2018Untouchable\u2019 by caste; and Shyama Prasad Mookerjee,",
  "a leading Bengal politician who belonged (at this time) to the Hindu Ma-",
  "hasabha. All three had collaborated with the rulers while the Congress men",
  "servedtimeinBritishjails.ButnowNehruandhiscolleagueswiselyputaside",
  "these differences. Gandhi had reminded them that \u2018freedom comes to India,",
  "nottotheCongress\u2019,urgingtheformationofaCabinetthatincludedtheablest",
  "men regardless of party affiliation.6",
  "The first Cabinet of free India was ecumenical in ways other than the",
  "political. Its members came from as many as five religious denominations",
  "(with a couple of atheists thrown in for good measure), and from all parts of",
  "India. There was a woman, Rajkumari Amrit Kaur, as well as two Untouch-",
  "ables.",
  "On 15 August the first item on the agenda was the swearing-in of the",
  "Governor General, Lord Mountbatten, who until the previous night had been",
  "the last viceroy. The day\u2019s programme read:",

  "joyouslycelebratedthecomingofIndependence.Threehundredflag-hoisting",
  "functions were reported from the capital alone. In the country\u2019s commercial",
  "hub, Bombay, the city\u2019s mayor hosted a banquet at the luxurious Taj Mahal",

  "born\u2019.",
  "When the first, so to say fantastical, Independence Day was observed on",
  "26 January 1930 the crowds were \u2018solemn and orderly\u2019 (as Nehru observed).",
  "But,in1947,whentherealdayofIndependencecame,thefeelingsondisplay",
  "were rather more elemental. To quote a foreign observer, everywhere, \u2018in city",
  "after city, lusty crowds have burst the bottled-up frustrations of many years",
  "in an emotional mass jag. Mob sprees have rolled from mill districts to gold",
  "coasts and back again . . . [T]he happy, infectious celebrations blossomed in",
  "forgetfulness of the decades of sullen resentment against all that was symbol-",
  "ized by a sahib\u2019s sun-topi.\u2019",
  "The happenings in India\u2019s most populous city, Calcutta, were character-",
  "istic of the mood. For the past few years the city had been in the grip of a",
  "cloth shortage, whose signs now miraculously disappeared in a \u2018rash of flags",
  "that has broken out on houses and buildings . . ., on cars and bicycles and",
  "in the hands of babes and sucklings\u2019. Meanwhile, in Government House, a",
  "new Indian governor was being sworn in. Not best pleased with the sight was",
  "the private secretary of the departing British governor. He complained that",
  "\u2018the general motley character of the gathering from the clothing point of viewdetracted greatly from its dignity\u2019. There were no dinner jackets and ties on",
  "view: only loincloths and white Gandhi caps. With \u2018the throne room full of",
  "unauthorized persons\u2019, the ceremony was \u2018a foretaste of what was to come\u2019",
  "after the British had left India. Its nadir was reached when the outgoing gov-",

  "caps were on display at Government House with neither his knowledge nor",

  "West Bengal, who asked him what form the celebrations should take the next",
  "day. \u2018People are dying of hunger all round,\u2019 answered Gandhi. \u2018Do you wish",
  "to hold a celebration in the midst of this devastation?\u20197",
  "Gandhi\u2019s mood was bleak indeed. When are porter from the leading na-",
  "tionalist paper, the Hindustan Times, requested a message on the occasion of",
  "Independence,herepliedthat\u2018hehadrundry\u2019.TheBritishBroadcastingCor-",
  "poration asked his secretary to help them record a message from the one man",
  "the world thought really represented India. Gandhi told them to talk to Jawa-",
  "harlal Nehru instead. The BBC were not persuaded: they sent the emissary",
  "back, adding, as inducement, the fact that this message would be translated",
  "into many languages and broadcast around the globe. Gandhi was unmoved,",
  "saying: \u2018Ask them to forget I know English.\u2019",
  "Gandhi marked 15 August 1947 with a twenty-four-hour fast. The free-",
  "dom he had struggled so long for had come at an unacceptable price.",
  "Independence had also meant Partition. The last twelve months had seen al-",
  "most continuous rioting between Hindus and Muslims. The violence had be-",
  "gun on 16 August 1946 in Calcutta and spread to the Bengal countryside.",
  "From there it moved on to Bihar, then on to the United Provinces and finally",

  "the Congress did not really represent the interests of India\u2019s largest minority,",
  "the Muslims.",
  "By starting a riot in Calcutta in August 1946, Jinnah and the League",
  "hoped to polarize the two communities further, and thus force the British to",
  "divide India when they finally quit. In this endeavour they richly succeeded.",
  "TheHindusretaliatedsavagelyinBihar,theiractionssupportedbylocalCon-",

  "to any government \u2018whose authority is directly denied by large and powerful",
  "elements in the Indian national life\u2019.8 The blood shed of 1946\u20137 seemed to",
  "suggest that the Muslims were just such an element, who would not live eas-",
  "ilyorreadilyunderaCongressgovernmentdominatedbyHindus.Now\u2018each",
  "communal outbreak was cited as a further endorsement of the two-nation the-",
  "ory, and of the inevitability of the partition of the country\u2019.9",
  "Gandhi was not a silent witness to the violence. When the first reports",
  "cameinfromruralBengal,heseteverythingelseasideandmadeforthespot.",
  "This77-year-oldmanwalkedindifficultterrainthroughslushandstone,con-",
  "soling the Hindus who had much the worse of the riots. In a tour of seven",
  "weekshewalked116miles,mostlybarefoot,addressingalmostahundredvil-",
  "lage meetings. Later he visited Bihar, where the Muslims were the main suf-",
  "ferers. Then he went to Delhi, where refugees from the Punjab had begun to",
  "pour in, Hindus and Sikhs who had lost all in the carnage. They were filled",
  "with feelings of revenge, which Gandhi sought to contain, for he was fear-",
  "ful that it would lead to retributory violence against those Muslims who had",
  "chosen to stay behind in India.",
  "Two weeks before the designated day of Independence the Mahatma left",
  "Delhi. He spent four days in Kashmir and then took the train to Calcutta,",
  "where, a year after it began, the rioting had not yet died down. On the af-",
  "ternoon of the 13th he set up residence in the Muslim dominated locality of",
  "Beliaghata, in \u2018a ramshackle building open on all sides to the crowds\u2019, to see",
  "whether \u2018he could contribute his share in the return of sanity in the premier",
  "city of Calcutta\u2019.Gandhi decided simply to fast and pray on the 15th. By the afternoon",
  "news reached him of (to quote a newspaper report) \u2018almost unbelievable",
  "scenes of fraternity and rejoicing\u2019 in some of the worst affected areas of Cal-",
  "cutta.\u2018WhileHindusbeganerectingtriumphalarchesattheentranceofstreets",
  "and lanes and decorating them with palm leaves, banners, flags and bunt-",
  "ing, Muslim shopkeepers and householders were not slow in decorating their",
  "shops and houses with flags of the Indian Dominion\u2019. Hindus and Muslims",
  "drovethroughthestreets inopencarsandlorries, shoutingthenationalist slo-",
  "gan \u2018Jai Hind\u2019, to which \u2018large, friendly crowds of both communities throng-",
  "ing the streets readily and joyfully responded\u2019.10",
  "Reports of this spontaneous intermingling seem to have somewhat lifted",
  "the Mahatma\u2019s mood. He decided he would make a statement on the day, not",
  "to theBBC, butthrough his own preferred means of communication, the pray-",
  "er meeting. A large crowd \u2013 of 10,000 according to one report, 30,000 ac-",
  "cording to another \u2013 turned up to hear him speak at the Rash Bagan Maidan",
  "in Beliaghata. Gandhi said he would like to believe that the fraternization",
  "between Hindus and Muslims on display that day \u2018was from the heart and not",
  "a momentary impulse\u2019. Both communities had drunk from the \u2018poison cup of",
  "disturbances\u2019; now that they had made up, the \u2018nectar of friendliness\u2019 might",
  "taste even sweeter. Who knows, perhaps as a consequence Calcutta might",
  "even \u2018be entirely free from the communal virus for ever\u2019.",
  "ThatCalcuttawaspeacefulon15Augustwasarelief,andalsoasurprise.",
  "For the city had been on edge in the weeks leading up to Independence. By",
  "the terms of the Partition Award, Bengal had been divided, with the eastern",
  "wing going to Pakistan and the western section staying in India. Calcutta, the",
  "province\u2019s premier city, was naturally a bone of contention. The Boundary",
  "Commission chosetoallot ittoIndia,sparkingfearsofviolence ontheeveof",
  "Independence.",
  "Across the subcontinent there was trouble in the capital of the Punjab,",
  "Lahore. This, like Calcutta, was a multireligious and multicultural city.",
  "Among the most majestic of its many fine buildings was the Badshahi",
  "mosque, built by the last of the great Mughal emperors, Aurangzeb. But",
  "LahorehadalsooncebeenthecapitalofaSikhempire,andwasmorerecently",
  "a centre of the Hindu reform sect, the Arya Samaj. Now, like all other settle-",
  "ments in the Punjab, its fate lay in the hands of the British, who would divide",
  "up the province. The Bengal division was announced before the 15th, but an",
  "nouncement of the Punjab \u2018award\u2019 had been postponed until after that date.",
  "Would Lahore and its neighbourhood be allotted to India, or to Pakistan?The latter seemed more likely, as well as more logical, for the Muslims",
  "were the largest community in the city. Indeed, a new governor had already",
  "beenappointedforthenewPakistaniprovinceofWestPunjab,andhadmoved",
  "intoGovernmentHouseinLahore.Ontheeveningofthe15thhethrewaparty",
  "to celebrate his taking office.",
  "As he later recalled, this \u2018must have been the worst party ever given by",
  "anyone . . . The electric current had failed and there were no fans and no",
  "lights.Theonlylightwhichwehadwasfromtheflamesoftheburningcityof",
  "Lahore about half a mile away. All around the garden, there was firing going",
  "on \u2013 not isolated shots, but volleys. Who was firing at who, no one knew and",
  "no one bothered to ask.\u201911",
  "No one bothered to ask. Not in the governor\u2019s party, perhaps. In",
  "Beliaghata, however, Mahatma Gandhi expressed his concern that this \u2018mad-",
  "ness still raged in Lahore\u2019. When and how would it end? Perhaps one could",
  "hope that \u2018the noble example of Calcutta, if it was sincere, would affect the",
  "Punjab and the other parts of India\u2019.",
  "III",
  "By November 1946 the all-India total of deaths in rioting was in excess of",
  "5,000. As an army memo mournfully observed: \u2018Calcutta was revenged in",
  "Noakhali, Noakhali in Bihar, Bihar in Garmukteshwar, Garmukteshwar in",

  "Attheendof1946oneprovincethathadescapedtheriotingwasthePun-",

  "landlords. They held the peace uncertainly, for ranged against themwere the",
  "militantMuslimLeaguersontheonesideandthenolessmilitantSikhpolitic-",
  "al party, the Akali Dal, on the other. Starting in January, episodic bouts of vi-",
  "olence broke out in the cities of Punjab. These accelerated after the first week",
  "ofMarch,whentheUnionistswereforcedoutofoffice.ByMaytheepicentre",
  "of violence had shifted decisively from the east of India to the north-west. A",
  "statement submitted to the House of Lords said that 4,014 people were killed",
  "in riots in India between 18 November 1946 and 18 May 1947. Of these, as",
  "many as 3,024 had died in the Punjab alone.13",
  "There were some notable similarities between Bengal and Punjab, the",
  "two provinces central to the events of 1946\u20137. Both had Muslim majorities,",
  "andthuswereclaimed forPakistan. Butbothalsocontained manymillions ofHindus. In the event, both provinces were divided, with the Muslim majority",
  "districtsgoingovertoEastorWestPakistan,whilethedistrictsinwhichother",
  "religious groups dominated were allotted to India.",
  "But there were some crucial differences between the two provinces as",
  "well. Bengal had along history of often bloody conflict between Hindus and",
  "Muslims, dating back to (at least) the last decades of the nineteenth century.",
  "By contrast, in the Punjab the different communities had lived more or less",
  "in peace \u2013 there were no significant clashes on religious groundsbefore 1947.",
  "In Bengal large sections of the Hindu middle class actively sought Partition.",
  "They were quite happy to shuffle off the Muslim-dominated areas and make",
  "theirhomeinoraroundtheprovincialcapital.Forseveraldecadesnow,Hindu",
  "professionals had been making their way to the west, along with landlords",
  "who sold their holdings and invested the proceeds in property or businesses",
  "in Calcutta. By contrast, the large Hindu community in the Punjab was dom-",
  "inated by merchants and moneylenders, bound by close ties to the agrarian",
  "classes. They were unwilling to relocate, and hoped until the end that some-",
  "how Partition would be avoided.",
  "The last difference, and the most telling, was the presence in the Punjab",
  "of the Sikhs. This third leg of the stool was absent in Bengal, where it was",
  "a straight fight between Hindus and Muslims. Like the Muslims, the Sikhs",
  "had one book, one formless God, and were a close-knit community of believ-",
  "ers. Sociologically, however, the Sikhs were closer to the Hindus. With them",
  "they had a roti-beti rishta \u2013 a relationship of inter-dining and inter-marriage",
  "\u2013 and with them they had a shared history of persecution at the hands of the",
  "Mughals.",
  "Forcedtochoose,theSikhswouldcomedownonthesideoftheHindus.",
  "But they were in no mood to choose at all. For there were substantial com-",
  "munities of Sikh farmers in both parts of the province. At the turn of the cen-",
  "tury, Sikhs from eastern Punjab had been asked by the British to settle areas",
  "in the west, newly served by irrigation. In a matter of a few decades they had",
  "built prosperous settlements in these \u2018canal colonies\u2019. Why now should they",
  "leave them? Their holy city,Amritsar,lay in the east, but Nankana Saheb (the",
  "birthplace of the founder of their religion) lay in the west. Why should they",
  "not enjoy free access to both places?",
  "Unlike the Hindus of Bengal, the Sikhs of Punjab were slow to com-",
  "prehend the meaning and reality of Partition. At first they doggedly insisted",
  "that they would stay where they were. Then, as the possibility of division be-",
  "came more likely, they claimed a separate state for themselves, to be called\u2018Khalistan\u2019. This demand no one took seriously, not the Hindus, not the",
  "Muslims, and least of all the British.",
  "The historian Robin Jeffrey has pointed out that, at least until the month",
  "of August 1947, the Sikhs were \u2018more sinned against than sinning\u2019. They had",
  "been \u2018abandoned by the British, tolerated by the Congress, taunted by the",
  "MuslimLeague,and,aboveall,frustratedbythefailuresoftheirownpolitical",
  "leadership . . .\u201914 It was the peculiar (not to say tragic) dilemma of the Sikhs",
  "that best explains why, when religious violence finally came to the Punjab,",
  "it was so accelerated and concentrated. From March to August, every month",

  "The boundary award was finally announced on 16 August. The award",
  "enraged the Muslims, who thought that the Gurdaspur district should have",
  "gone to Pakistan instead of India. Angrier still were the Sikhs, whose beloved",

  "According to Pete Rees\u2019s own figures, from March to the end of July,",

  "The Indian prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, was deeply worried about",
  "the Punjab troubles and their wider repercussions. In the last fortnight of",

  "There is another sight I am not likely to easily forget. A five-mile-",
  "long caravan of Muslim refugees crawling at a snail\u2019s pace into Pakistan",
  "over the Sutlej Bridge. Bullock-carts piled high with pitiful chattels,",

  "\u2018Nowhere in known history ha[d]the transfer of so many millions taken place",
  "in so few days\u2019. They fled, wrote an eyewitness,",
  "through heat and rain, flood and bitter Punjab cold. The dust of the cara-",

  "of fear and sweat, human waste and putrefying bodies. When the cloud",
  "of hate subsided the roll of the dead was called and five hundred thou-",
  "sand names echoed across the dazed land \u2013 dead of gunshot wounds,",
  "sword, dagger and knife slashes and others of epidemic diseases. While",
  "the largest number died of violence, there were tired, gentle souls wholooked across their plundered gardens and then lay down and died. For",

  "Meanwhile, trouble had flared up once more in Bengal. There were re-",

  "A deputation of prominent politicians representing the Congress, the Muslim",
  "LeagueandthelocallyinfluentialHinduMahasabhaassuredGandhithatthere",
  "would be no further rioting. The Mahatma now broke his fast, which had las-",
  "ted three days.The peace held, prompting Lord Mountbatten to remark famously that",
  "one unarmed man had been more effective than 50,000 troops in Punjab. But",
  "the Mahatma and his admirers might have treasured as much this tribute from",
  "the Statesman, a British-owned paper in Calcutta that had long opposed him",
  "and his politics: \u2018On the ethics of fasting as a political instrument we have",
  "over many years failed to concur with India\u2019s most renowned practitioner of",
  "it . . . But never in a long career has Mahatma Gandhi, in our eyes, fasted in",

  "appeal to the public conscience.\u201925",
  "On 7 September, having spent four weeks in Beliaghata, Gandhi left for",
  "Delhi. He hoped to proceed further, to the Punjab. However, on his arrival in",
  "the capital he was immediately confronted with tales of strife and disposses-",
  "sion. The Muslims of Delhi were frightened. Their homes and places of wor-",
  "shiphadcomeunderincreasingattack.Gandhiwastoldthatnofewerthat137",
  "mosques had been destroyed in recent weeks. Hindu and Sikh refugees had",
  "also forcibly occupied Muslim homes. As a Quaker relief worker reported,",
  "\u2018the Muslim population of Delhi of all classes \u2013 civil servants, businessmen,",
  "artisans, tongawallahs, bearers \u2013 had fled to a few natural strongholds\u2019 \u2013 such",
  "as the Purana Qila, the greathigh-walled fort in the middle of the city, and the",
  "tomb of the Mughal emperor Humayun. In the Purana Qila alone there were",
  "60,000 refugees, huddled together in tents, \u2018in the corners of battlements and",
  "in the open, together with their camels and tongas and ponies, battered old",
  "taxis and luxury limousines\u2019.26",
  "Gandhi now put his Punjab programme on hold. He visited the camps in",
  "the capital and outside it. In the plains around Delhi lived a farming commu-",
  "nity called Meos, Muslims by faith, but who had adopted many of the prac-",

  "Through September and October, writes his biographer D. G. Tendulkar,",

  "antee full redress to the Muslims in Delhi?\u2019",
  "With attacks on Muslims continuing, Gandhi chose to resort to another",
  "fast. This began on 13 January, and was addressed to three different constitu-",
  "encies. The first were the people of India. To them he simply pointed outthat if they did not believe in the two-nation theory, they would have to show",
  "in their chosen capital, the \u2018Eternal City\u2019 of Delhi, that Hindus and Muslims",
  "couldliveinpeaceandbrotherhood.Thesecondconstituencywasthegovern-",
  "ment of Pakistan. \u2018How long\u2019, he asked them, \u2018can I bank upon the patience",
  "of the Hindus and the Sikhs, in spite of my fast? Pakistan has to put a stop to",
  "this state of affairs\u2019 (that is, the driving out of minorities from their territory).",
  "Gandhi\u2019s fast was addressed, finally, to the government of India. They",

  "sum. New Delhi would not release the money as it was angry with Pakistan",
  "for having recently attempted to seize the state of Kashmir. Gandhi saw this",
  "asunnecessarily spiteful,andsohemadetheendingofhisfastconditional on",
  "the transfer to Pakistan of the money owed to it.",
  "On the night of 15 January the government of India decided to release",

  "refugees signed a declaration saying they would welcome back the displaced",
  "MuslimsofDelhiandallowthemtoreturntotheirhomes.ButGandhiwanted",
  "more authoritative assurances. Meanwhile, his health rapidly declined. His",
  "kidney was failing, his weight was dropping and he was plagued by nausea",
  "and headache. The doctors issued a warning of their own: \u2018It is our duty to",
  "tell the people to take immediate steps to produce the requisite conditions for",
  "ending the fast without delay.\u2019",
  "On 17 January a Central Peace Committee was formed under the lead-",
  "ership of the president of the Constituent Assembly, Rajendra Prasad. Other",
  "CongressPartymemberswereamongitsmembers,aswererepresentativesof",
  "the RSS, the Jamiat-ul-Ulema and Sikh bodies. On the morning of the 18th",
  "they took a joint declaration to Gandhi which satisfied him enough to end his",
  "fast. The declaration pledged \u2018that we shall protect the life, property and faith",
  "of Muslims and that the incidents which have taken place in Delhi will not",
  "happen again\u2019.35",
  "Would the \u2018miracle of Calcutta\u2019 be repeated in Delhi? The leaders of the",
  "militant groupings seemed chastened by Gandhi\u2019s fast. But their followers re-",
  "mained hostile. On previous visits to Delhi Gandhi had stayed in the sweep-",
  "ers colony; this time, however, he was put up at the home of his millionaire",
  "follower G. D. Birla. Even while his fast was on, bands of refugees marched",
  "past Birla House, shouting, \u2018Let Gandhi die'. Then, on 20 January, a Punjabi",
  "refugee named Madan Lal threw a bomb at Gandhi in Birla House while hewas leading a prayer meeting. It exploded at some distance from him; luckily",
  "no one was hurt.",
  "Gandhi was undaunted by the attempt on his life. He carried on meeting",

  "Gandhi had fought a lifelong battle for a free and united India; and yet,",
  "at the end, he could view its division with detachment and equanimity. Oth-",
  "ers were less forgiving. On the evening of 30 January he was shot dead by a",
  "young man at his daily prayer meeting. The assassin, who surrendered after-",
