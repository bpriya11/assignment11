  "The conference concluded with a talk by Mahatma Gandhi. He regretted",
  "that the conference had not met in the \u2018real India of the villages but in the",
  "cities that were \u2018influenced by the West\u2019. The \u2018message of Asia\u2019, insisted",
  "Gandhi, was \u2018not to be learnt through the Western spectacles or by imitating",
  "the atom bomb . . . I want you to go away with the thought that Asia has to",
  "conquer the West through love and truth.\u2019 11",
  "Gandhi made his appearance, but this was really Nehru\u2019s show. His ad-",
  "mirers saw it as confirmation of his status as the authentic voice of resurgent",
  "Asia. His critics were less generous. In its account of the conference, the",
  "Muslim League newspaper, Dawn, complained of how \u2018skilfully he [Nehru]",
  "has worked himself into some sort of all-Asian leadership. That is just what",
  "this ambitious Hindu leader had intended \u2013 to thrust himself upon the Asian",
  "nationsastheirleaderandthroughhisattainmentofthatprestigeandeminen-",
  "ce to further the expansionist designs of Indian Hinduism.\u201912",
  "II",
  "Nehru had often been to Europe before Independence. His first trip to the",
  "United States, however, took place two years after he had assumed office as",
  "prime minister. The US had not loomed large in Nehru\u2019s political imagina-",
  "tion. His Glimpses of World History, for example, devotes far less space to it",
  "than to China or Russia. And what he says is not always complimentary. Thecapitalism of the American kind had led to slavery, gangsterism, and massive",
  "extremes of wealth and poverty. The American financier J. Pierpont Morgan",
  "ownedayachtworth\u00a36million,yetNewYorkwasknownas\u2018HungerTown\u2019.",
  "Nehru admired Roosevelt\u2019s attempts at regulating the economy, but he was",
  "not hopeful that FDR would succeed. For \u2018American Big Business is held to",
  "be the most powerful vested interest in the modern world, and it is not go-",
  "ing to give up its power and privileges merely at the bidding of President",
  "Roosevelt\u2019.13",
  "Before Nehru\u2019s trip to America in late 1949, an enterprising reporter at",
  "Time magazine went through his writings.The exercise revealed that he had",
  "\u2018simply never given the subject [of America] much thought. As a British uni-",
  "versity man, he has perhaps looked down snobbishly at American deficiency",
  "in culture. As a sentimental socialist, he has ticked off the U.S. as unrivalled",
  "in technology but predatory in its capitalism.\u201914",
  "Nehru\u2019s feelings were widely shared. Like British aristocrats, the Indian",

  "country itself was scant. As Harold Isaac once pointed out, for the postwar",
  "American there were really only four kinds of Indians. These were: (1) the",
  "fabulous Indians, the maharajas and magicians coupled with equally exotic",
  "animals such as tigers and elephants; (2) the mystical Indians, a people who",
  "were \u2018deep, contemplative, tranquil, profound . . .\u2019; (3) the benighted Indians,",
  "who worshipped animals and many-headed gods, living in a country that",
  "was even more heathen than China; and (4) the pathetic Indians, plagued",
  "by poverty and crippled by disease \u2013 \u2018children with fly-encircled eyes, with",
  "swollen stomachs, children dying in the streets, rivers choked with bodies . .",
  ". Of these images perhaps the last two predominated. It was no accident that",
  "the book on the subcontinent best known in America was Katherine Mayo\u2019s",

  "Nehru,was\u2018under-standingandappreciationofeachotheramongnationsand",
  "peoples\u2019.",
  "This was diplomatically put, but elsewhere Nehru spoke more directly.",
  "At Columbia University Nehru deplored the desire to \u2018marshal the world into",
  "twohostilecamps\u2019.India,hesaid,wouldalignwithneither,butpursue\u2018anin-",
  "dependent approach to each controversial or disputed issue\u2019. In his view, the",
  "maincauseofwarwasthepersistenceofracialismandcolonialism.Peaceand",
  "freedom could be secured only if the domination of one country or one race",
  "over another was finally brought toan end.18",
  "The American press was impressed with the Indian prime minister. The",
  "Chicago Sun Times went so far as to say that \u2018in many ways Nehru is the",
  "nearest thing this generation has to a Thomas Jefferson in his way of giving",
  "voice to the universal aspirations for freedom of people everywhere\u2019.19 The",
  "Christian Science Monitor described himas a \u2018World Titan\u2019 . When he left, a",
  "columnist in the St. Louis Post Dispatch observed that \u2018Nehru has departed",
  "fromus,leavingbehindcloudsofmisty-eyedwomen\u2019.20EvenTimemagazine",
  "admittedthat,whileAmericanswerestillnotsurewhatNehrustoodfor,\u2018they",
  "sensed in him, if not rare truth, a rare heart\u2019.21",
  "There was, however, one set of people who did not warm to the visitor",
  "from India \u2013 the mandarins of the State Department. Nehru had several",
  "long discussions with the secretary of state, Dean Acheson, but these went",
  "nowhere. In his memoirs Acheson wrote dismissively and with some despair",
  "about Nehru\u2019s visit. In their talks he found him \u2018prickly\u2019, arrogant \u2018he talked",
  "tome...asthoughIwasapublicmeeting),andtooreadytopickonthefaults",

  "combination of a public speech and flashes of anger and deep dislike of his",
  "opponents\u2019. Altogether, he found Nehru \u2018one of the most difficult men with",
  "whom I have ever had to deal\u2019.22",
  "OtherAmericanofficialsweremoresympathetictoNehru.Onesuchwas",
  "Chester Bowles, who was ambassador in New Delhi from 1951-3. Witness-",
  "ing Nehru at work in his own environment, Bowles was visibly impressed by",
  "his commitment to democracy and democratic procedure, and to the rights of",
  "minorities. Dean Acheson, and many other Americans, divided the world in-",
  "to two categories: friends and foes.23 That was not a reading that Bowles en-",
  "dorsed. He insisted that \u2018it is immature and ridiculous for us [Americans] tojump to the conclusion that because he [Nehru] is not 100 per cent for us, he",
  "must be against us\u2019.24",
  "During Bowles\u2019s tenure India and the United States drew closer. The US",
  "sentexpertsandequipmenttohelpwithIndianprogrammesofagriculturalde-",
  "velopment. But the popular mistrust persisted. A writer from Delaware, tour-",
  "ing the subcontinent in the early fifties, came across many educated Indians",
  "for whom the United States was a country \u2018isolated by gross faults, stewing",
  "alone in the unthinkable sins of materialism, imperialist ambitions, war mon-",
  "gering, political corruption, spiritual and cultural poverty, racial discrimina-",
  "tion and injustice\u2019.25",
  "The mutual distrust deepened after 1953, when the Republicans found",
  "themselves backinpoweraftertwentyyearsoutofit.Towardstheendofthat",
  "year William F. Knowland, the Republican leader in the Senate, undertook a",
  "six-week world tour. After he returned home he told the US News and World",
  "Report that Jawaharlal Nehru did not represent all the nations or peoples of",
  "Asia. Said Senator Knowland emphatically: \u2018Certainly Nehru does not speak",
  "fortheRepublicofKorea,forJapan,forFreeChinaorFormosa,forThailand,",
  "Viet Nam, Laos or Cambodia. He certainly does not speak for Pakistan. The",
  "only countries he might be able to speak for with some authority, or at least",
  "represent their views, would be India itself, Indonesia which is also neutralist",
  "in outlook, and perhaps Burma . . .\u2019.26",
  "These views were shared by the new secretary of state, John Foster",
  "Dulles. Dulles was the coldest of cold warriors, whose foreign policy was",
  "dominated by his obsession with communism. In the battle against the Soviet",
  "Union,Dulleswaspreparedtodisregardtheinternalpoliticalsystemsofother",
  "nations. Generally speaking, dictators who toed the American linewere to be",
  "preferredtodemocratswhodidn\u2019t:\u2018Ifheisabastard,atleastheisourbastard,",
  "as he is famously supposed to have said.",
  "Dulles and Nehru disliked each other from the start. The American",
  "claimed that \u2018the concept of neutrality is obsolete, immoral, and short",
  "sighted\u2019. Those who professed it were, in effect, crypto-communists. Nehru,",
  "naturally,didnottakekindlytothisinterpretation.AstheAustraliandiplomat",
  "Walter Crocker wrote, the Indian prime minister did not miss the irony that,",
  "as regards the sanctity of the Free World and the Free Life proclaimed",
  "byDulles,he,damnedbyDulles,wascarryingIndiathroughaargantuan",
  "effort towards Parliamentary Democracy, the rule of law, freedom and",
  "equality for all religions, and social and economic reforms, while amongthe countries which Dulles praised and subsidized because they were",
  "\u2018willing to stand up and be counted\u2019 as anti-Communist were effete or",
  "persecuting tyrannies, oligarchies and theocracies, sometimes corrupt as",
  "well as retrograde.27",
  "Dulles further offended Indian sensibilities when he suggested that Portugal",
  "\u2013 a trusted US ally \u2013 could keep its colony of Goa as long as it chose to.",
  "However, the secretary\u2019s decisive contribution to wrecking Indo-US relations",
  "wasthemilitarypacthesignedwithPakistaninFebruary1954.Asonehistor-",
  "ian drily remarked, \u2018Mr Dulles wanted pacts . . . Pakistan wanted money and",
  "arms.\u201928",
  "Almost from the time of Independence the United Kingdom had seen",
  "Pakistan as a potential ally in the Cold War; as, in fact, a \u2018strong bastion",
  "againstCommunism\u2019.Bycontrast,IndiawasseenasbeingsoftontheSoviets.",
  "WinstonChurchillhimselfwasmuchimpressedbytheargumentthatPakistan",
  "could be made to stand firm on Russia\u2019s eastern flank, much as that reliable",
  "Western client, Turkey, stood firm on the west. The brilliant young Harvard",
  "professor Henry Kissinger endorsed this idea \u2013 in his view, the \u2018defense of",
  "Afghanistan [from the Soviets] depends on the strength of Pakistan\u2019.29",
  "For Republicans like Dulles, the fight against communism was para-",
  "mount. Hence the tilt towards Pakistan, which he saw as a key member of",
  "a defensive ring around the Soviet Union. From bases in Pakistan American",
  "planes could strike deep into Soviet central Asia. Dulles\u2019s view was seconded",
  "by Vice-President Richard Nixon and their combined efforts ultimately pre-",
  "vailedoverPresidentEisenhower,whowasworriedaboutthefall-outinIndia",
  "following any formal alliance with Pakistan.30",
  "American military aid to Pakistan ran to about $80 million a year. The",
  "US also encouraged the Pakistanis to join the anti-Soviet military alliances in",
  "central and Southeast Asia known as CENTO and SEATO. Two months be-",
  "fore Dulles signed his pact with the Pakistan is an American missionary who",
  "had worked for years in the subcontinent warned that \u2018to weigh Pakistan mil-",
  "itarily over and against India would alienate India\u201931 That it certainly did, al-",
  "thoughtherewereotherstrainsonIndo-Americanrelationsaswell.Intheon-",
  "goingconflictsoftheColdWar\u2013asinKoreaandIndo-China\u2013Indiawasseen",
  "as being too neutral by far. Nehru\u2019s vigorous canvassing of the recognition of",
  "thePeople\u2019sRepublicofChina,andhisinsistencethatitbegiventheperman-",
  "ent seat in the UN Security Council then occupied by Taiwan, was also not",
  "taken to kindly by Washington. There were an increasing number of Americ-answhofeltthatNehruhad\u2018enteredthearenaofworldpoliticsasachampion",
  "challenging American wisdom\u2019.32",
  "As perhaps he had. For, as Nehru wrote to the industrialist G. D. Birla in",
  "May 1954, \u2018I do not think that there are many examples in history of a suc-",
  "cessionofwrongpoliciesbeingfollowedbyacountryasbytheUnitedStates",
  "in the Far East during the past five or six years. They have taken one wrong",
  "step after another . . . They think that they can solve any problem withmoney",
  "and arms. They forget the human element. They forget the nationalistic urges",
  "of people. They forget the strong resentment of people in Asia against impos-",
  "itions.\u201933",
  "The industrialist himself was rather keen that the two countries forge",
  "better relations. In October 1954 Birla visited the UnitedStates and spoke to",

  "The next month John Foster Dulles made so bold as to visit New Delhi.",
  "The record of his talks with the Indian government is still classified, but we",
  "do have the proceedings of a press conference he addressed. Here, the secret-",
  "ary of state was subject to a series of hostile questions. He was asked why he",
  "had said that Goa was an integral part of Portugal. Dulles did not deny this,",
  "but clarified that he was for a \u2018peaceful solution\u2019 of the controversy. Then the",
  "talk turned to military aid to Pakistan, and the possibility that it might lead",
  "to an escalation of the conflict in Kashmir. Dulles defensively answered that",
  "\u2018thearmssupplytoPakistanis notdesigned inanywaytobeathreat toIndia\u2019.",
  "When the questioner persisted, Dulles angrily remarked that \u2018we do not feel",

  "Ascompared to bourgeois countries, concluded Nehru, the Soviet Union",
  "treated its workers and peasants better, its women and children better,even its",
  "prisoners better. The credulousness of the narrative is made complete by the",
  "epigraph to the book of his travels \u2013 Wordsworth on the French Revolution:",

  "Nehru\u2019sbiographerpointsoutthathevisited\u2018theSovietUnioninthelast",
  "days of its first, halcyon period. If his reaction was idealistic, it was partly",
  "because there was still some idealism in the air. 39 This is true, after a fash-",
  "ion; for there was still aglow about Lenin (whose own intolerance was not",
  "yet widely known outside Russia); while the extermination of kulaks and the",
  "Siberian death camps lay in the future. And of course there were other such",
  "endorsements provided by Western fellow-travellers of the 1920s. Like them,",
  "Nehru had come intending to be impressed; and he was.40It was, above all, the Soviet economic system which most appealed to",
  "Nehru. As a progressive intellectual of his time, he thought state ownership",
  "more just than private property, state planning more efficient than the market.",
  "His Glimpses of World History contains an admiring account of the",
  "Sovietfive-year plans.Yetatnotime washeattracted bytheBolshevik model",
  "of armed revolution or by the one-party state. His training under Gandhi pre-",
  "disposed him towards non-violence, and his exposure to Western liberalism",
  "made him an enthusiast for electoral democracy and a free press.",
  "After Independence, relations with the Soviet Union were at first frosty.",
  "ThiswasbecausetheCommunistPartyofIndia,withMoscow\u2019sblessing,had",
  "attempted to overthrow the state. But the insurrection failed, and the Soviets",

  "The consummation of this change was the reception given to Jawaharlal",

  "The writer was A. D.Gorwala, a Western-oriented liberal. There were",

  "with the democracies in the Cold War.47 But these were most likely out-",
  "numbered, and certainly outshouted, by those Indians who suspected the Un-",

  "Nehru at first tried hard to avoid taking sides in the Cold War. But, as he",
  "often said, this non-alignment was not mere evasion; it had a positive charge",
  "to it. Athird bloc might come to act as a salutary moderating effect on the",
  "hubris of the superpowers. We have spoken already of the Asian Relations",
  "Conferencein1947.Anothersucheffort,inwhichNehruplayedanimportant",
  "part, was the Afro-Asian conference, held in the Indonesian city of Bandung",
  "in 1955.Only countries that had independent governments were invited to",
  "Bandung. Twenty-nine sent delegations, including India and China. Four",
  "Africannationswererepresented(theothersstilllayunderthecolonialyoke);",
  "but delegates from Iran, Iraq, Saudi Arabia and Syria all came. The meeting",
  "discussed methods of cultural and economic co-operation, and committed it-",
  "self firmly to the end of colonial rule. For, as President Sukarno of Indonesia",
  "observed, \u2018how can we say that colonialism is dead so long as vast areas of",
  "Asia and Africa are unfree?\u201949",
  "Nehru considered the Bandung Conference \u2018a great achievement\u2019; it",
  "\u2018proclaimed the political emergence in world affairs of over half the world\u2019s",
  "population. [But] it presented no unfriendly challenge or hostility to anyone .",
  ". .\u2019 Ashe told the Indian Parliament on his return, the historic links between",
  "Asian and African countries had been sundered by colonialism; now, as free-",
  "dom dawned, they could be revived and reaffirmed.50",
  "This last protestation was in answer to the charge that Bandung and",
  "the like were, in essence, anti-Western. How \u2018non-aligned\u2019, in fact, was non-",
  "alignment? In India, its ideals were put sternly to the test in the second half",
  "of 1956. In July of that year Gamal Abdel Nasser nationalized the company",
  "that managed the Suez Canal. Britain (whose strategic interests were most",
  "threatened by the action) reacted by asking for international control over the",
  "Canal. Nehru, who knew both parties well, tried hard to mediate. But he",
  "failed,andultimately,inlateOctober,theBritish,incollusionwiththeFrench",
  "and the Israelis, undertook a military invasion of Egypt. This act of neocolo-",

  "in brutal fashion to restore the status quo ante. Their action, like that of the",
  "British and the French in the Middle East, was viewed as an unacceptable in-",
  "fringement of national sovereignty.",
  "Indian commentators saw the invasions of Egypt and Hungary as wholly",
  "comparable. Both were \u2018acts of international brigandage by powers that com-",
  "manded permanent seats in the UN Security Council \u2013 both had \u2018spread a",
  "wave of cynicism throughout the world\u2019. As a Madras journal pointed out,",
  "while the independence of Egypt threatened the oil resources of Britain and",

  "Hungarian territory\u2019, India, represented by V. K. Krishna Menon, abstained.",
  "This caused great resentment in the Western world, and exposed the Indian",
  "government to the charge of keeping double standards.54",
  "There was also much domestic criticism of India\u2019s stand. There was an",

  "ful sycophancy to the Soviet rulers . . .\u2019 \u2018By kowtowing to Russia we have",

  "The fiasco over Hungary undermined Nehru\u2019s international credibility.",

  "Western bloc when its actions are wrong\u2019, but \u2018equivocal language when the",
  "Soviet bloc goes off the rails\u2019.57 The episode also exposed the prime minister",
  "to the charge ofputting personal loyalty above national purpose. Forwhile he",
  "privately deplored what Krishna Menon had done, he stood by him in public.",

  "in London after Independence. Here he worked very hard, but also made en-",
  "emies,throughhisarroganceandbyfrequentlyadvertisinghisfriendshipwith",

  "After returning from London, Krishna Menon was made a Cabinet min-",
  "ister without portfolio. He became a sort of roving ambassador, representingIndia at the UN and at disarmament meetings in Geneva. A man of forceful",
  "opinions, he was controversial both in his homeland and out of it. The \u2018lucid-",
  "ity of his intellect\u2019, wrote one journalist who knew him well, \u2018is sometimes",
  "clouded by passions and resentments\u2019. Since his \u2018likes and dislikes are",
  "stronger than would seem quite safe for a man in his position\u2019, it did seem",
  "\u2018strange that a man who carries such a storm around with him should have",

  "over Hungary in 1956. But he still would not discard him. Why? A helpful",
  "answer is provided by Alva Myrdal, who was Sweden\u2019s ambassador in India",
  "at the time, and knew Nehru well. The prime minister, concluded Myrdal,",

  "The Chinese leader had \u2018experienced many hardships and endured tremend-",

  ". Mao reminded Pannikar of his own boss, Nehru, for \u2018both are men of action",
  "with dreamy, idealistic temperaments\u2019, and both \u2018may be considered human-",

  "He thought that in view of the \u2018rebuff over Tibet, India should no longer ad-",
  "vocate China\u2019s case for entry into the UN. Finally, he argued that the latest",
  "developments should prompt afresh reconsideration of \u2018our relationship with",
  "China, Russia, America, Britain and Burma\u2019. Patel seemed here to be hinting",
  "that India should reconsider its policy of non-alignment in favour of an alli-",
  "ance with the West.66",
  "This latter shift was advocated more vigorously by the journalist D. F.",
  "Karaka. Like Patel, Karaka was appalled by Pannikar\u2019s carelessness. (Appar-",
  "ently, the ambassador did not hear about the Chinese invasion until it was",
  "announced on All-India Radio.) The annexation of Tibet had shown that the",
  "Himalaya was no longer impregnable. And the Indian army lacked the equip-",
  "mentortrainingtotakeonadetermined andfocusedenemy.Thus,concluded",
  "Karaka, \u2018whatever may be our past unhappy relations with Britain, however",
  "much may be our fear of American imperialism spreading in Asia, we have",
  "to decide now whether we will continue with this policy of neutrality and en-",
  "danger our frontiers, or whether we will take the lesser risk and make a milit-",
  "ary pact with the United States and with Great Britain.\u201967",
  "Nehru would not deign to take notice of journalists such as Karaka. But",
  "he did answer Patel, in a note on the subject circulated to the Cabinet. He",
  "thought it a pity that Tibet could not be \u2018saved\u2019. Yet he considered it \u2018exceed-",
  "inglyunlikely\u2019thatIndiawouldnowfaceanattackfromChina;itwas\u2018incon-",
  "ceivable\u2019 that they would \u2018undertake a wild adventure across the Himalayas\u2019.",
  "He thought that \u2018the idea that communism inevitably means expansion and",
  "war, or to put it more precisely, that Chinese communism means inevitablyan expansion towards India, is rather naive\u2019. Regardless of the happenings in",
  "Tibet, India should still seek \u2018some kind of understanding\u2019 with Beijing, for",

  "The border in the centre was relatively uncontentious, whereas in the",
  "two extremes the situation was more problematic. The Chinese regarded the",
  "McMahon Line in particular as an imperialist imposition. For the moment",
  "they let the matter pass, and focused on getting India\u2019s goodwill, necessary at",
  "this time as a bridge to the Western world. In the summer of 1952 a govern-",
  "ment delegation led by Mrs Vijayalakshmi Pandit visited Beijing. Mrs Pan-",
  "dit had served as India\u2019s ambassador to Moscow; more to the point, she was",
  "Nehru\u2019sadoredyoungersister.ShemetMaoonceandChouEn-laitwice,and",

  "statesman and possesses abundant vitality and charm. He is polished and has",
  "a sense of humour which is terribly infectious. One has to join in his laughter",
  "\u2013 and he laughs often. He makes one feel at home in a moment and his con-",
  "versation loses nothing in translation.",
  "The letter did strike the odd ambivalent note. \u2018We have been wined and",
  "dined\u2019, wrote Mrs Pandit, \u2018and have spoken of friendship and culture and",
  "peace until I am getting alittle tired.\u2019 And she wasn\u2019t sure whether the Great",
  "Helmsman reminded her more of Gandhi or of Stalin. For while \u2018Mao gives",
  "the impression of being kind and tolerant and wise\u2019, the \u2018tolerant part struck",
  "me almost as if it might be apose as it is reminiscent of the Russian lead-",
  "ers particularly Stalin. He uses the same gesture in greeting and has the same",
  "technique with the public. Still, what stood out was \u2018the great vitality of the",
  "people and the dedicated manner in which they are working. The oppressionone feels in Moscow is absent here. Everybody seems happy and determined",
  "to make the country prosperous\u2019.69",
  "Mrs Pandit seems to have reacted to China in 1952 much as her brother",
  "had reacted to Russia in 1927. Perhaps this dawn might not turn out to be a",
  "false one after all. So Nehru was inclined to think, too. Soon, romanticism",
  "was to be reinforced by realpolitik. The United States began to tilt markedly",
  "towards Pakistan, giving New Delhi one more reason to befriend Beijing. In",
  "a wide-ranging agreement signed in April 1954, India officially recognized",
  "Tibet as being part of China. The joint declaration outlined five principles of",
  "peaceful co-existence (panch sheel), which included mutual non-aggression",
  "and mutual respect for each other\u2019s territorial integrity.70",
  "One person who did not welcome this agreement was the former sec-",
  "retary general of the Foreign Ministry, Sir Girija Shankar Bajpai. Writing to",
  "acolleague, Bajpai warned that communist China was no\u2018different from Rus-",
  "sian Communism in its expansionist aims . . .\u2019 The current thinking in New",
  "Delhi was of \u2018the naturalness of indefinite continuance of indefinite peace",
  "and friendship between China and us\u2019. Bajpai feared that \u2018those on whom the",
  "P[rime] M[inister] now relies most for advice completely and vehemently re-",
  "ject any possibility of a change in what appears to be China\u2019s present policy",
  "of peace with its Asian neighbours\u2019.71",
  "ItisunlikelythatthiswarningreachedNehru,andevenifithadhewould",
  "most likely have disregarded it. Towards the end of 1954 he visited China for",
  "the first time. As in Russia six months later, huge crowds were mobilized to",
  "greet the visitor, who appreciated this \u2018tremendous emotional response from",
  "the Chinese people . Nehru had discussions with Chou En-lai about border",
  "questions, and with Mao about the world situation. He also pressed the case",
  "forTibetan autonomy,the Chinese assuring him in the Dalai Lama\u2019spresence",
  "thattheBuddhiststatewouldenjoyastatuswhich\u2018nootherprovinceenjoyed",
  "in the People\u2019s Republic of China\u2019.72",
  "On his return from China Nehru addressed a mammoth public meeting",
  "on the Calcutta Maidan. A million people heard him affirm that \u2018the people",
  "of China do not want war\u2019; they were too busy uniting their country and get-",
  "ting rid of poverty. He spoke admiringly of the spirit of unity in China, the",
  "absence of the provincial and sectarian interests that bedevilled India. As for",
  "the \u2018mighty welcome\u2019 he had received in the People\u2019s Republic, this was \u2018not",
  "because Iam Jawaharlal with any special ability, but because I am the Prime",
  "Minister of India for which the Chinese people cherish in their hearts the",
  "greatest of love and with which they want to maintain the friendliest of rela-",
  "tions\u2019.73Two years later the compliment was returned when Chou En-lai visited",
  "India. With him were the Dalai and Panchen Lamas, who had been invited as",
  "part of the celebrations of the 2500th birth anniversary of the Buddha. On a",
  "drive through the countryside the Dalai Lama escaped his Chinese minders",
  "and travelled with Nehru. A revolt was brewing in Tibet against the occupi-",
  "ers, he said; he himself was strongly tempted to seek asylum in India. If that",
  "wasnotpossible,atleastIndiacouldsendaconsultoLhasawhowasnotpro-",
  "Chinese or pro-communist. When Nehru asked Chou about the situation in",
  "Tibet,theChineseleaderconcededthattherehadbeen\u2018unfortunateincidents\u2019",
  "there, and promised to look into them.74",
  "So there the matter rested. The Dalai Lama went back to Lhasa, and",
  "India and China continued to be brothers-in-arms; as the slogan of the time",
  "went,Hindi-Chinibhai-bhai.Themanmostresponsibleforthiswasthecharm-",

  "far, the veteran politician C. Rajagopalachari. \u2018Rajaji\u2019 had lunch with the",
  "Chinese prime minister and later wrote to a friend that, \u2018frankly my impres-",
  "sion was very favourable. Apart from the general thawing of all communists",
  "the Chinese Premier is I believe agood type of man and trustworthy.75",
  "In public India and China expressed undying friendship, buton the",

  "cerned with the eastern sector; China with the western one. The British had",
  "drawntheMcMahonLinetoprotecttheprosperousteaestatesoftheprovince",
  "of Assam from a putative raid down the Himalaya. There was an \u2018Inner Line",
  "at the foot of the hills, beyond which no one could venture without a permit.",
  "Between this and the border lay some 50,000 square miles of densely fores-",
  "ted territory, inhabited by many self-contained and self-administered tribes,",
  "each too small to form a separate state, each too remote to be subservient to",
  "any existing one. Some of the tribes were Buddhist, and there was also an old",
  "Buddhist monastery at Tawang. This paid tribute to Tibetan authorities and",
  "was \u2018ecclesiastically subject\u2019 to Lhasa.",
  "Underthetreatyof1914,theBritishpersuadedtheTibetanstorelinquish",
  "control over Tawang. For, as one colonial official argued, it was necessary",

  "TibetandAssamwilladjoineachotherand,ifTibetshouldagaincomeunder",
  "Chinese control, it will be a dangerous position for us\u2019.76",
  "Other tribes living between the Inner and Outer Lines were beyond",
  "Tibetan influence. These, like the Buddhists, became Indian citizens by de-",
  "fault in August 1947, when the new government inherited the borders be-",
  "queathed it by the British. Slowly, New Delhi moved to fill in the admin-istrative vacuum that the British had left behind. In February 1951 a small",
  "force accompanied by apolitical officer visited Tawang, and instructed the la-",
  "mas that they need no longer pay tribute to Lhasa. Officials also began to",
  "fan out into what was now called the North-East Frontier Agency, or NEFA.",
  "AnIndianFrontierAdministrativeService(IFAS)wasformed,whoserecruits",
  "were coached on how best to deal with the sometimes truculent tribes by the",
  "British-bornanthropologistVerrierElwin,whowasnowanIndiancitizenand",
  "a confidant of Nehru.77",
  "The Chinese, for their part, focused on expanding their footprint in the",
  "western sector. Here, too, the adjoining Indian territory, known as Ladakh,",
  "was Buddhist in its religious colouring. However, it had been an independent",
  "state as early as the tenth century. And for the past 150 years it had been part",
  "of the principality of Kashmir, whose own allegiances were all to the Indian",
  "side of the border.",
  "Between north-east Ladakh and Sinkiang, on the Chinese side, lay an el-",
  "evated table-land named Aksai Chin, \u2018absolutely bare\u2019 for the most part, with",
  "occasional patches of \u2018scant herbage\u2019.78 In the past, Ladakhi pastoralists had",
  "used Aksai Chin for grazing and salt collection. By an agreement of 1842",
  "this area was identified as being part of Kashmir. This was confirmed by the",
  "British, who were worried that the Russians, their adversary in the \u2018Great",
  "Game\u2019,might use the plateau to advance heavy artillery into British India.",
  "That didn\u2019t happen, but after 1950 the Chinese saw in the same flat ter-",
  "rain a route to their troublesome province of Tibet from the Sinkiang town",

  "Yarkand to Lhasa.",
  "We owe this information to accounts published much later. At the time,",
  "however, the Chinese activities in the west, and the Indian activities in the",
  "east, were carried on out of each other\u2019s gaze. To the world at large, and to",

  "\u2018If there were ever two countries where every prospect promised brotherly",
  "understanding and friendship\u2019, wrote a Bombay newspaper in January 1952,\u2018these two are India and Pakistan. Every possible kind of tie exists between",
  "them; the tie of race, the ties of language, of geography, economy and cul-",
  "ture.79",
  "Yet India\u2019s relations with Pakistan were poisoned from the start. The",
  "country had been divided against a backdrop of violence; and the mutual sus-",
  "picion and hostility persisted. In the winter of 1949/50 there was a wave of",
  "communal riots in East Pakistan. Several hundred thousand Hindus crossed",
  "over the border into India. Nehru now suggested to his Pakistani counterpart,",
  "Liaqat Ali Khan, that they together visit the affected areas to bring about",
  "peace. His offer was declined; but Khan agreed to come to Delhi and sign",
  "an agreement binding both countries to the humane treatment of their re-",
  "spective minorities. However, the \u2018Nehru-Liaqat\u2019 pact failed to stem the tide",
  "of refugees. There was much anger among Hindus in West Bengal, some of",
  "whom even wanted the government to go to war with Pakistan on their be-",
  "half.80",
  "The two main conflicts, however, were about those elemental human",
  "needs,landandwater.Thefirst,whichthisbookhasalreadyalludedtoandto",
  "which it will return, related to the unresolved status of Kashmir. The second",
  "pertainedtothefairuseoftheIndusanditsfivemaintributaries.Theserivers",

  "er four rivers ran for many miles in Indian territory. This made it possible for",
  "India to regulate their flow and impound water before the rivers reached the",
  "other country.",
  "After Partition, the governments of East and West Punjab signed a",
  "\u2018StandstillAgreement\u2019wherebywatercontinuedtoflowuninterrupted.When",
  "this lapsed, in April 1948, India stopped the waters of the Ravi and the Sutlej",

  "the farmers of West Punjab. Within a month a newagreement was signed, and",
  "water supply restored. However, the building of the Bhakra-Nangal dam, on",
  "the Indian side of the Sutlej river, prompted fresh protests by Pakistan.",
  "Both sides now sought amore permanent solution to the problem.",
  "Pakistan asked for the matter to be referred to international arbitration, which",
  "India at first refused. The World Bank stepped in to play the role of peace-",
  "maker. Knowing the recalcitrance of both sides, the Bank offered a surgical",
  "solution \u2013 the waters of three rivers would go to Pakistan, the waters of theother three rivers to India. This proposal was tabled in February 1954; it took",
  "another six years for the two sides to finally sign it.81",
  "With the Indus, as with Kashmir or any other topic under the subcontin-",
  "ental sun,agreement was made more difficult bydomestic politics. AnIndian",
  "or Pakistani head of government who promoted dialogue was inevitably ac-",
  "cused of selling out to the other side. An early example of this was the trade",
  "war of 1949\u201351, prompted by the devaluation of the Indian rupee. Pakistan",
  "stopped the shipment of jute in protest; India retaliated by refusing to supply-",
  "coal.82 The conflict was resolved only when, in February 1951, Nehru agreed",
  "to recognize the par value of the Pakistani rupee. His decision was welcomed",
  "by chambers of commerce, but bitterly opposed by politicians of all stripes.",
  "The general consensus in New Delhi was that \u2018India has been completely de-",
  "feated\u2019. One Congress member reported that the feeling in the party office",
  "wasthat\u2018suchahumiliationcouldnothavebeenpossibleifSardarPatelwere",
  "alive\u2019. A refugee leader remarked, \u2018The real question to be considered now",
  "is to find out the next issue on which Jawaharlal will surrender to Pakistan",
  "\u2013 Kashmir, or more probably Evacuee Property\u2019. A spokesman of the Hindu",
  "Mahasabha said, \u2018In order to become a world leader, Nehru can go to the ex-",
  "tent of surrendering the whole of India to Pakistan.\u2019 And an RSS organizer",
  "claimed,\u2018Thisshowswhatistocomenext.Moreappeasementandsurrenders",
  "if the masses do not check Nehru.83",
  "On the Pakistani side, any concession to India was likewise seen by",
  "opposition politicians as appeasement of the enemy. At the popular level,",
  "however, the feelings about the other side were distinctly mixed. Nationalist",
  "ideology drove them apart; but mass culture brought them back together",
  "again. It was not just that they ate the same food and lived in the same kinds",
  "of homes. They also had the same sense of fun. Indian filmstars were widely",
  "admired in Pakistan; and Pakistani cricketers given arousing reception when",
  "they played in India.",
  "This ambivalence is captured in an exchange printed by the Karachi",
  "newspaper Dawn in 1955. A lady who had recently visited her relatives in In-",
  "dia wrote of her experiences while travelling by train from Amritsar to Am-",
  "bala. When they heard she was from Pakistan, she was set upon by passen-",
  "gers who were refugees from Sindh and West Punjab. Apparently, \u2018some of",
  "the non-refugee Hindu passengers remonstrated, but the refugee Hindus and",
  "Sikhs brushed aside their remonstrance, saying that the non-refugees could",

  "VII",
  "Indian foreign policy was opposed to the continuance of colonial rule any-",
  "where. This, naturally, meant reclaiming the pieces of the motherland that",
  "were still under the control of foreigners. When the British left in 1947, the",
  "Portuguese stayed on in Goa and their other possessions in India while the",
  "Frenchremainedincontrolofthreesliversoflandinthesouth\u2013mostimport-",
  "antly the port of Pondicherry \u2013 as well as the eastern enclave of Chandern-",
  "agore.",
  "In June 1949 the population of Chandernagore voted by an over-whelm-",
  "ing majority to merge withIndia. The electionhad witnessed a resounding dis-",
  "play of patriotism, with posters representing a mother in Indian dress reach-",
  "ing out to reclaim a child clad in Western apparel. A year later the territory",
  "was transferred. But the French hung on to their slices of south India. In the",
  "spring of 1954 the situation became \u2018increasingly tense\u2019; there was a vigor-",
  "ous pro-merger movement afoot in Pondicherry, and daily demonstrations in",
  "front of the French consulate in Madras. On 1 November the French finally",
  "handed over their territories, which the Indians celebrated with a spectacu-",
  "lardisplayoffireworks.ThefollowingJanuary\u2019sannualRepublicDayparade",
  "for the first time featured a float from Pondicherry, with young girls singing",
  "French songs.85",
  "In welcoming back these fragments, Jawaharlal Nehru praised the gov-",
  "ernments of both countries for their \u2018tolerance, good sense and wisdom\u2019, thus",
  "solving the problem of French India \u2018with grace and goodwill\u2019.86 These re-",
  "marks were intended above all for the Portuguese, who, however, were not",
  "listening. They were determined to hang on to Goa for as long as they could.",
  "As the transfer of Pondicherry was being finalized, the Portuguese dictator",
  "Antonio de Oliveira Salazar spoke on national radio of their Indian colonies",
  "as belonging to \u2018the Portuguese Nation by injunction of History and force ofLaw\u2019. \u2018Goa constitutes a Portuguese community in India\u2019, he insisted: \u2018Goa",
  "represents alight of the West in lands of the Orient. It had to be retained, so",
  "that it might \u2018continue to be the memorial of Portuguese discoveries and a",
  "small hearth of the spirit of the West in the East\u2019.87",
  "A Goa Congress Committee had been in operation since well before",
  "Independence; its activists included resident Goans as well as exiles in Bom-",
  "bay. They argued that the conditions in Goa were far worse than in British",
  "India; racial prejudice was rife and human rights wholly absent. In 1946 the",
  "left-wing Congress politician Rammanohar Lohia visited the territory and ex-",
  "horted the people to rise against the rulers. A wave of strikes and protests fol-",
  "lowed; these were crushed by the authorities. On 15 August 1947 the Indian",
  "tricolour was hoisted here and there, but the protesters were quickly taken",
  "away by the police.88",
  "Apart from Goa, the Portuguese also held several smaller territories up",
  "theKonkancoast.OnewasDaman,whichhadagarrisonof1,500Africansol-",
  "diers from Portuguese East Africa. This abutted the Indian province of Bom-",
  "bay, which after Independence had imposed prohibition. There was now a",
  "flourishing trade in the smuggling of liquor. On Sunday evenings the frontier",
  "between Daman andBombay was\u2018strewnwithpilgrims toBacchus, wending",
  "their way back to the land where they belong, back to Bharat, land of scarcity",
  "and austerity.89",
  "Alcoholicsapart,mostpoliticallyconsciousIndianswereoutragedbythe",

  "that the matter would be resolved by dialogue. But his hand was being forced",
  "byradicalsoftheSocialistParty,whobeganaseriesofsatyagrahastocompel",
  "Goa to join the union. In July 1954 a group of activists from Bombay seized",
  "the tiny enclave of Dadra. The next month the somewhat bigger enclave of",
  "Nagar-Haveli also fell without a fight. Then 1,000 volunteers attempted to",
  "cross over to Daman on Independence Day. They were stopped by the Indi-",
  "an police, whereupon they wired the prime minister for support. Nehru wired",
  "back saying that such a showdown would not \u2018help our cause\u2019.90",

  "ForJawaharlalNehru,foreignpolicywasameansofmakingIndia\u2019spresence",

  "uniquecombinationofidealismandglamour;italsoofferedthechanceofper-",

  "1948, Nehru called him to his room and showed him a map of the world. The",
  "prime minister\u2019s eyes ranged over the globe, and his fingers pointed to places",
  "north,south,eastandwest.\u2018Wewillhavefortyembassies!\u2019heexclaimed.\u2018We",
  "will have forty missions!\u201992",
  "Five years later, when India did have forty missions, Nehru wrote them",
  "all a letter of self-congratulation. The \u2018prestige of India has greatly increased",
  "since Independence, he said, for \u2018we have always avoided playing a flashy",
  "role in international affairs . . . Gradually, an appreciation has grown in other",
  "countries of our own sincerity of purpose even though there has been dis-",
  "agreement. He asked all those representing India abroad \u2013 \u2018from the Head of",
  "the Mission to the humblest employee\u2019 \u2013 to \u2018feel and work as ahappy fam-",
  "ily,cooperating with each other . . .",
  "We are all partners in a great adventure, and are all partners and comrades in",
  "the same undertaking.\u201993",
  "Although presented and carried out as a collective enterprise, this partic-",
  "ular adventure had \u2018made by the prime minister\u2019 stamped all over it. In 1950,",
  "one of his most intelligent and least sycophantic cabinet ministers spoke of",
  "howNehruwasbecoming\u2018thebiggestmanintheworld,overtoppingtheUSA",
  "men,theUKmenandeveryotherman\u2019.Throughitsleader,acountry\u2018without",

  "word listened to with respect in the councils of the great\u2019.94 Even opposition",
  "politicians appreciated what Nehru had done for India\u2019s international stand-",
  "ing. Non-alignment seemed to them to be acreative application of Gandhian",
  "principles in world affairs. Confidence in its viability was strengthened when",
  "Indiawascalled upontoplayanimportant mediatory roleintheconflicts and",
  "civil wars of the time.",
  "Intelligent foreigners also praised Nehru\u2019s non-alignment. When that",
  "now great publishing firm, Feltrinelli of Milan, began operationsin 1955, one",
  "of the first two books it published was Nehru\u2019s autobiography, which it cel-ebrated both for its \u2018consistent and coherent anti-fascism\u2019 and as an authen-",
  "tic voice of \u2018the countries that were emerging from colonial domination . . .",
  "to take their place forcefully in the global political system\u2019.95 And from her",

  "Such was Nehru\u2019s standing among the people of the front-line states",
  "in the Cold War, those who stood between the United States and the Soviet",
  "Union. In 1955 non-alignment still had a glow and moral halo about it. The",
  "next year was the Hungary fiasco, and the beginning of the Western disillu-",

  "thestatesofthenewnationshouldbedefinedonthebasisoflanguage.Shortly",
  "afterwards, on 10 October 1947, he wrote to a colleague: \u2018I do believe that",
  "we should hurry up with the reorganization of linguistic provinces\u2019 . . . There",
  "may be an illusion for the time being that different languages stand for differ-",
  "ent cultures, but there is also the possibility[that with the creation] of linguistic",
  "provinces it may disappear. I shall write something [about it] if I get the time\u2019. . . I am not unaware that a class of people have been saying that linguistic",
  "provinces are wrong. In my opinion, this class delights in creating obstacles.1",
  "Jawaharlal Nehru was also appreciative of the linguistic diversity of In-",
  "dia. In an essay of 1937, he wrote that \u2018a living language is a throbbing, vital",
  "thing, ever changing, ever growing and mirroring the people who speak and",
  "write it\u2019. And \u2018our great provincial languages are no dialects or vernaculars,",
  "as the ignorant sometimes call them. They are ancient languages with a rich",
  "inheritance, each spoken by many millions of people, each tied up inextric-",
  "ably with the life and culture and ideas of the masses as well as the upper",
  "classes. It is axiomatic that the masses can only grow educationally and cul-",
  "turally through the medium of their own language.\u20192",
  "That was Nehru\u2019s view in 1937, but by 1947 he was having other",
  "thoughts. The country had just been divided on the basis of religion: would",
  "not dividing it further on the basis of language merely encourage the break-",
  "up of the Union? Why not keep intact the existing administrative units, such",
  "as Madras, which had within it communities of Tamil, Mala-yalam, Telugu,",
  "Kannada, Urdu and Konkani speakers, and Bombay, whose peoples spoke",
  "Marathi, Gujarati, Urdu, Sindhi, Gondi and other tongues? Would not such",
  "multilingual and multicultural states provide an exemplary training in harmo-",
  "niousliving?Inanycase,shouldnotthenewnationuniteonthesecularideals",
  "of peace, stability and economic development, rather than revive primordial",
  "identities of caste and language?",
  "Nehru gave voice to these reservations in a speech to the Constituent",
  "Assembly three months after Independence. While the Congress had once",
  "promised linguistic provinces, he said, the country now faced \u2018a very critical",
  "situation resulting from partition\u2019. Now \u2018disruptionist tendencies had come to",
  "the fore\u2019; to check them, one had to underline \u2018the security and stability of",
  "India . . . The first essential therefore is for India as a whole to be strong",
  "and firmly established, confident in her capacity to meet all possible dangers",
  "and face and meet all problems. If India lives, all parts of India also live and",
  "prosper. If India is enfeebled, all her component elements grow weak.\u20193",
  "The creation of linguistic provinces, then, had to be deferred until such",
  "time as India was strong and sure of herself. Nehru seems to have persuaded",
  "even Gandhi of this, for in November 1947 the Mahatma was writing that",
  "\u2018the reluctance to enforce linguistic redistribution is perhaps justifiable in the",
  "presentdepressingatmosphere.Theexclusivespiritiseveruppermost.Noone",
  "thinks of the whole of India.\u2019 Gandhi now thought that the reorganization of",

  "died out and been replaced by \u2018a healthy atmosphere, promoting concord intheplaceofdiscord,peaceintheplaceofstrife,progressintheplaceofretro-",
  "gression and life in the place of death.\u20194",
  "As ever, Gandhi extolled the need to take \u2018one step at a time\u2019. But the",
  "principle itself he would not surrender. In a prayer meeting held on 25 Janu-",
  "ary 1948 Gandhi returned to the subject of linguistic states. \u2018The Congress",
  "had decided some twenty years ago\u2019, he recalled, \u2018that there should be as",
  "many provinces in the country as there are major languages.\u2019 Now it was in",
  "power, and in a position to execute that promise. Gandhi thought that if new",
  "provinces were formed on the basis of language, and if",
  "they are all placed under the authority of Delhi there is no harm at all.",
  "But it will be very bad if they all want to be free and refuse to accept",
  "central authority. It should not be that Bombay then will have nothing",
  "to do with Maharashtra and Maharashtra with Karnataka and Karnataka",
  "with Andhra. Let all live as brothers. Moreover if linguistic provinces",
  "are formed it will also give a fillip to the regional languages. It would be",
  "absurd to make Hindusthani the medium of instruction in all the regions",
  "and it is still more absurd to use English for this purpose.5",
  "Within a week Gandhi was dead. And the men in power had other, and",
  "more urgent, matters to attend to. Millions of refugees from East and West",
  "Pakistan had to be found homes and gainful employment. An undeclared war",

  "and perhaps indefinitely, the creation of new provinces had to wait.",

  "division by religion had the support of both Vallabhbhai Patel and C. Rajago-",

  "the population. The western half was a Punjabi-speaking region, with Sikhs",
  "constituting a little over half the population.",
  "The division by religion did not perfectly map division by language.",
  "Where all Sikhs had Punjabi as their first language, so did many Hindus.",

  "Without question the most vigorous movement for linguistic autonomy was",

  "inated against by the Tamils. The Mahasabha was also active in the princely",
  "state of Hyderabad.",
  "After Independence the speakers of Telugu asked the Congress to imple-",
  "ment its old resolutions in favour of linguistic states. The methods they used",
  "to advance their case were various: petitions, representations, street marches",
  "and fasts. In a major blow to the Congress, the former Madras Chief Minister",
  "T.Prakasamresignedfromthepartyin1950ontheissueofstatehood.Cutting",
  "across party lines, the Telugu-speaking legislators in the Madras Assembly",
  "urged the immediate creation of a state to be named Andhra Pradesh. In the",

  "to an appeal by the respected Gandhian leader Vinoba Bhave.13",
  "The case for Andhra was now put to the test of universal adult suffrage.",
  "During his campaign tour in the Telugu-speaking districts, Jawaharlal Nehru",
  "was met at several places by protesters waving black flags and shouting \u2018We",
  "want Andhra\u2019.14 The official party paper wrote in dismay that \u2018the Congress",
  "President witnessed demonstrations by protagonists of an Andhra State, with",
  "slogans, placards and posters. At some place she smiled at them, at others",
  "he was enraged by their behaviour.\u201915 The signs were ominous, and indeed",
  "despite its successes elsewhere the Congress did very poorly here. Of the",

  "comes, let us have them by all means.\u2019",
  "As K. V. Narayana Rao has written, \u2018this attitude of Nehru appeared too",
  "vague and evasive to the Andhras. Nobody knew what the right time was and",
  "when it would come.\u2019 Impatient for an answer, the Andhras intensified their",
  "protest. On 19 October 1952 a man named Potti Sriramulu began a fast-unto-death in Madras. He had the blessings of Swami Sitaram, and of thousands of",
  "other Telugu speakers besides.18",
  "Born in Madras in 1901, Sriramulu had studied sanitary engineering be-",
  "fore taking a job in the railways. In 1928 he suffered a double tragedy when",

  "his post to join the salt satyagraha. Later he spent some time at Gandhi\u2019s",
  "Sabarmati ashram. Later still he spent eighteen months in jail as part of the",
  "individual satyagraha campaign of 1940\u20131.",

  "ashram \u2018was epoch-making. For here was a seeker full of love and humility,",
  "all service and all sacrifice for his fellow-humanity; and here also was a guru,",
  "the world-teacher, equally full of affection, truth, ahimsa and kinship with",
  "daridra narayana or the suffering poor. While at Sabarmati, [Sriramulu] . . .",
  "did histasks with cheer and devotion, and won the affection of the intimates",
  "and the approbation of the Kulapati [Gandhi].\u201919",
  "GandhididregardSriramuluwithaffectionbutalso,itmustbesaid,with",
  "a certain exasperation. On 25 November 1946 the disciple had begun a fast-",
  "unto-death to demand the opening of all temples in Madras province to Un-",
  "touchables. Other Congress representatives, their minds more focused on the",
  "impending freedom of India, urged him to desist. When he refused they ap-",
  "proached Gandhi,whopersuaded himtoabandonthefast.TheMahatma then",
  "wrote to T. Prakasam that he was \u2018glad that the fast of Sreeramulu ended in",
  "the happy manner you describe. He had sent me a telegram immediately he",
  "broke his fast. I know he is a solid worker, though a little eccentric.\u201920",
  "That fast of 1946 Potti Sriramulu had called off at Gandhi\u2019s insistence;",
  "but in 1952 the Mahatma was dead. In any case, Andhra meant more to Sri-",
  "ramulu than the Untouchables once had. This fast he would carry out till the",
  "end, or until the government of India relented.",
  "On 3 December Nehru wrote to Rajagopalachari: \u2018Some kind of fast is",
  "going on for the Andhra Province and I get frantic telegrams. I am totally un-",
  "moved by this and I propose to ignore it completely. By this time Sriramulu",

  "accept the Andhra demand. \u2018Otherwise complete frustration will grow amongthe Andhras, and we will not be able to catch up with it. Two days later Ra-",

  "starts from this focus, as the Andhra boys are highly emotional and prone to",

  "Over the course of the next few months the Telugu districts of Madras",

  "the chief minister, was \u2018accompanied by a lot of bad language, bad behaviour",
  "and distrust and anger\u2019.24 Suppressing his feelings, Rajagopalachari attended",

  "bers of the Commission travelled across India. They visited 104 towns andcities, interviewed more than 9,000 people and received as many as 152,250",
  "written submissions.",
  "One of the longer and more interesting submissions was from the Bom-",

  "Purushottamdas Thakurdas, and had within its ranks other prominent indus-",
  "trialists such as J. R. D. Tata. On its masthead were many of the city\u2019s most",

  "The Bombay Citizens Committee had a one-point agenda \u2013 to keep the",

  "Marathi-speaking heartland.The first settlers were Europeans; the chief merchants and capitalists Gu-",
  "jaratis and Parsis; the chief philanthropists Parsis. The city was built by non-",
  "Maharashtrians. Even among the working class, Marathi speakers were often",
  "outnumbered by north Indians and Christians. For the Bombay Citizens Com-",
  "mittee, it was clear that \u2018on the grounds of geography, history, language and",
  "population or the system of law, Bombay and North Konkan cannot be con-sidered as a part of the Mahratta region as claimed by the protagonists of",
  "Samyukta Maharashtra\u2019.26",
  "Behind the veneer of cosmopolitanism there was one language group",
  "that dominated the \u2018save Bombay\u2019 movement: the Gujaratis. If Bombay be-",
  "came the capital of a greater Maharashtra state, the politicians and ministers",
  "would be mostly Marathi speakers. The prospect was not entirely pleasing to",
  "the Gujarati-speaking bourgeoisie, whether Hindu or Parsi. It was they who",
  "staffed, financed, and basically ran the Bombay Citizens Committee.27",
  "Nehru himself was somewhat sympathetic towards the idea of keeping",
  "Bombay out of the control of a single language group. So was the Marathi-",
  "speaking M. S. Golwalkar, this a rare meeting of minds between the prime",
  "minister and the RSS supremo. Both thought that the creation of linguistic",
  "states would \u2018lead to bitterness and give rise to fissiparous tendencies endan-",
  "gering the unity of the country\u2019.28 In May 1954 Golwalkar spoke in Bombay",
  "at the invitation of the Anti-Provincial Conference, which saw linguistic de-",
  "mands as a manifestation of \u2018the menace of provincialism and sectionalism\u2019.",

  "as early as 1946 there was a Samyukta Maharashtra Parishad in operation.",
  "Within its ranks were Maharashtrians of all political persuasions, left and",
  "right, secular and communal, Brahmin, Maratha and Harijan. The Parishad",
  "sought a state that would unite Marathi speakers dispersed across many dif-",
  "ferent political units. In their minds, however, there was no doubt that such a",
  "state could have only one capital: Bombay.",
  "The president of the Samyukta Maharashtra Parishad was the veteran",
  "Congress man Shankarrao Deo, while its secretary and chief theoretician was",
  "thecelebratedCambridge-educatedeconomistD.R.Gadgil.InGadgil\u2019sopin-",
  "ion,whileBombaycouldstillbethemajorportandeconomiccentreofMaha-",
  "rashtra, there must be a \u2018compulsory decentralization\u2019 of the city\u2019s industries.",
  "Another ideologue, G. V. Deshmukh, was more blunt. Unless Bombay city",
  "became part of their state, he said, Maharashtrians would have to remain con-",
  "tent with \u2018playing the part of secondary brokers to brokers, secondary agents",
  "toagents,assistantprofessorstoprofessors,clerkstomanagers[and]hiredla-",
  "bourers to shopkeepers\u2019.30To answer the Citizens Committee of the Gujaratis, the Samyukta Ma-",
  "harashtra Parishad prepared an impressive 200-page document of its own.",
  "The first part mounted a theoretical defence of the principle of linguistic",
  "states. These, it argued, would deepen federalism by bringing together speak-",
  "ersofthesamelanguageinoneconsolidated,cohesiveunit.Thus,\u2018alinguistic",
  "provincewithitsadministrationinthelanguageofthecommonpeople,would",
  "make it possible for the people to feel and understand the working of demo-",
  "cracy and the need to participate in it\u2019.",
  "Coming specifically to their own state, the document claimed that \u2018soci-",
  "ety all over the Marathi country is remarkably homogeneous\u2019. There was the",
  "same configuration of castes, the same deities and saints, the same folklore",
  "and legends. That the Marathi speakers were presently spread out over three",
  "political units \u2013 Hyderabad, Bombay state, and the Central Provinces \u2013 was",
  "an accident of history that needed urgently to be undone.",
  "AnewandunifiedstateofMaharashtrahadtobecreated,arguedthePar-",
  "ishad, with Bombay as its capital. For the land on which this island city stood",
  "had long been inhabited by speakers of the Marathi language. While the sea",
  "lay to Bombay\u2019s west, the territory to its north, south and east was dominated",
  "by Marathi speakers. The city itself was the main centre of the Marathi press,",
  "of publications in the Marathi language and of Marathi culture. Economic-",
  "ally, Bombay depended heavily on its Marathi hinterland, from where it drew",
  "much of its labour and all its water and power. Its ways of communication all",
  "lay through Maharashtra. In sum, it was \u2018unthinkable to form a State of Ma-",
  "harashtra which has not Bombay as its capital and it would render impossible",
  "theworkingofaStateofMaharashtra,ifanyattemptwasmadetoseparatethe",
  "cityofBombayfromit\u2019.TotheargumentthatthecitydidnothaveaMarathi-",

  "citiestobemultilingual.InBurma\u2019scapital,only32percentofthepopulation",
  "spoke the national language, but \u2018nobody yet dared to suggest that Rangoon",
  "should be considered as non-Burmese territory\u2019.31",
  "Bombay was surrounded by Marathi-speaking districts; it must be the",
  "capital of a new state of Maharashtra. So argued the Samyukta Maharashtra",
  "Parishad.ButtheCitizensCommitteeclaimedthatBombayhadbeennurtured",
  "mostlybynon-Maharashtrians,andmustthereforebeconstitutedasaseparate",
  "city-state. Could the two sides ever agree? In June 1954 Shankarrao Deo vis-",
  "ited Sir Purushottamdas Thakurdasto discuss a compromise. Deo said that",
  "there was no negotiation possible on their core demand \u2013 Bombay as capital",
  "of Maharashtra \u2013 but said that they could work together to retain \u2018the sameautonomous character of the metropolitan city, ensuring its cosmopolitan",
  "life; its trade, commerce and industry, etc.\u2019. Sir Purushottamdas, for his part,",
  "was willing to give up the city-state idea in favour of a composite bilingual",
  "province of Marathi and Gujarati speakers.32",
  "The meeting was civil, but inconclusive. The matter of Bombay was re-",
  "ferred to the States Reorganization Commission, the hottest of the many hot",
  "potatoes it became their misfortune to handle.",
  "V",
  "The members of the StatesReorganization Commission were ajurist, S. Fazl",

  "After eighteen months of intensive work, the trio submitted their report in",

  "homogeneity as an important factor conducive to administrative convenience",
  "and efficiency\u2019 yet not \u2018as an exclusive and binding principle, over-riding all",
  "other considerations\u2019. Among these other considerations were, of course, the",
  "unity and security of India asawhole.33",
  "Next,innineteenchapters,thereportoutlinedtheirspecificproposalsfor",
  "reorganization. With respect to the southern states, it seemed easy enough to",
  "redistribute areas according to the major language zones: Telugu, Kannada,",
  "Tamil and Malayalam. Districts and taluks (sub-districts) were reallocated",
  "with regard to which linguistic group was in a majority. Four compact states",
  "would replace the melange of territories deriving from the British period.",
  "With regard to north India, the SRC likewise sought to divide the huge",
  "Hindi-speaking belt into four states: Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh",
  "and Rajasthan. In the east, the existing provinces would stay as they were,",
  "withminoradjustments.TheCommissionrejectedthedemandfortribalstates",

  "The SRC\u2019s recommendation that Bombay be the capital of a bilingual state",
  "wasdiscussedinParliamenton15November1955.TheambitiousBombayMP",
  "S. K. Patil thought the Commission should have gone further. He thought",
  "the government should create a city-state of Bombay; no doubt hoping that it",
  "might come to be managed by himself. The prospective city-state, he argued,",
  "had a \u2018cosmopolitan population in every respect\u2019; it had been \u2018built upon the",
  "labour of everybody\u2019. If left to govern itself, Bombay would \u2018be a miniature",
  "India run on international standards\u2019 . . . [A] melting pot which will evolve a",
  "glorious new civilisation . . . And it is an extraordinary coincidence that the",
  "population of the city should be exactly one per cent of the population of the",
  "whole country. This one per cent drawn from all parts of the country will set",
  "the pace for other states in the practice of secularism and mutual understand-",

  "Patil,liketheSRCitself,askedtheMaharashtrianstogiveuptheirclaim",

  "did not speak for his fellow Maharashtrians. Speaking immediately after Patil",
  "in the Lok Sabha was the Congress MP from the city of Pun\u00e9, N.V. Gadgil.",
  "Gadgil insisted that while he was in favour of compromise, \u2018there is a limit.",

  "The SRC urged the Maharashtrians to accept the loss of Bombay in the",
  "name of national unity. Gadgil protested against this attempt at blackmail.",
  "The last 150 years, he said, had seen Maharashtrians contributing selflessly",
  "to the growth of national feeling. Marathi speakers founded the first Indian",
  "schools and universities, and helped found the Indian National Congress. The",
  "Mahrattas were \u2018the pioneers of violent action\u2019 against the British. Later, inthe early twentieth century, when the Congress Party languished, \u2018who was",
  "it that brought in new life? Who propounded the new tenets and new philo-",
  "sophy? It was Lokmanya Tilak. In the Home Rule movement he led and in",

  "This interpretation was vigorously contested by N. V. Gadgil. He be-",

  "The movements for linguistic states revealed an extraordinary depth of",
  "popular feeling. For Kannadigas and for Andhras, for Oriyas as for Maha-",

  "religion. This was manifest in their struggles, and in their behaviour when the",
  "struggle was won.",
  "One sign of this was official patronage of the arts. Thus great effort, and",
  "cash, went into funding books, plays and films written or performed in the",

  "this was overwhelmingly a country of cultivators and labourers. Nearly three-",
  "quarters of the workforce was in agriculture, a sector which also contributed",
  "close to 60 per cent of India\u2019s gross domestic product. There was a small but",
  "growing industrial sector, which accounted for about 12 per cent of the work-",
  "force, and 25 per cent of GDP.",
  "Thepeasant wasthebackbone oftheIndiannation, andoftheIndianeco-",
  "nomy. There existed enormous variations in agricultural practices across the",
  "subcontinent. There was, for instance, a broad division between the wheat re-",
  "gions of the north and west, where women generally did not participate in cul-",
  "tivation, and the rice regions of the south and east, where women\u2019s work was",
  "critical to the raising of seedlings. Large parts of peninsular India grew neither",
  "ricenorwheat:here,thechiefcerealswereanarrayofdrought-resistantmillets.Besides grain, peasants grew a wide range of fruit crops, as well as market-",
  "oriented produce such as cotton and sugar cane.",
  "These variations notwithstanding, everywhere in India agriculture was",
  "largely empirical, based on knowledge and traditions passed down over the",
  "generations,ratherthanonideasfrombooks.Everywhereitwaschieflybased",
  "on local inputs. The water, the fuel, the fodder, the fertilizer; these were all",
  "gatheredinthevicinityofthevillage.Thelandwastilledwithaploughpulled",
  "by a pair of bullocks. The homes were built of wood and thatch fetched by",
  "hand from the nearby forests.",
  "Everywhere, those who worked on the land lived cheek-by-jowl with",
  "those who didn\u2019t. The agriculturists who made up perhaps two-thirds of the",
  "rural population depended crucially on the service and artisanal castes: on",
  "blacksmiths, barbers, scavengers and the like. In many parts there were vi-",
  "brant communities of weavers. In some parts there were large populations of",
  "nomadic pastoralists.",
  "On the social side, too, there were similarities in the way in which life",
  "was lived across the subcontinent. Levels of literacy were very low. Caste",
  "feelings were very strong, with villages divided into half a dozen or more en-",
  "dogamous jatis. And religious sentiments ran deep.",
  "Rural India was pervaded by an air of timelessness. Peasants, shepherds,",
  "carpenters, weavers, all lived and worked as their forefathers had done. As a",
  "survey of the 1940s putit, \u2018there is the same plainness of life, the same wrest-",
  "ling with uncertainties of climate (except in favoured areas), the same love",
  "of simple games, sport and songs, the same neighbourly helpfulness, and the",
  "same financial indebtedness\u2019.1",
  "To the Indian nationalist, however, continuity was merely a euphemism",
  "for stagnation. Agricultural productivity was low; hence also levels of nutri-",
  "tion and health. About the only thing that was rising was population growth.",
  "Fromthelatenineteenthcentury,asmedicalservicesexpanded,thedeathrate",
  "rapidly fell. Consequently, since the birth rate remained constant, there was a",
  "steady rise in population. Between 1881 and 1941 the population of British",
  "India rose from 257 to 389 million. But (or hence) the per capita availability",
  "of food grains declined from an already low level of200 kilograms per person",
  "per year to a mere 150.",
  "Almost from the time the Congress was founded in 1885, Indian nation-",

  "reform of the system of land tenure. Particularly in north and east India, the",
  "British had encouraged a system of absentee landlordism. In many other dis-",
  "tricts too, those who tilled the land usually did not own it.",
  "While tenants did not have security of tenure, agricultural labourers had",
  "no land to till in the first place. Inequalities in the agrarian economy could",
  "be very sharp indeed. The forms of exploitation were manifold and highly",
  "innovative. Thus, apart from land tax, zamindars (landowners) in the United",
  "Provinces levied an array of additional cesses on their peasants such as mo-",
  "torana (to pay for the zamindar\u2019s new car) and hathiana (to pay for his ele-",
  "phants).2 The landlord was prone to treat his animals and his vehicles far bet-",
  "ter than he did his labourers. Two weeks before Independence a progressive",
  "weekly from Madras ran a story about distress in rural Malabar. This pro-",
  "filed a large landlord who owned seven elephants, for which he needed some",
  "25,000 kilograms of paddy. His own tenants, meanwhile, were given three",
  "days\u2019 ration for the whole week.3",

  "In 1938 the Congress setup a National Planning Committee (NPC), charged",
  "with prescribing a policy for economic development in a soon- to-be-free In-",
  "dia. Chaired by Jawaharlal Nehru, the committee had some thirty members",
  "in all \u2013 these divided almost equally between the worlds of science, industry",
  "and politics. Sub-committees were allotted specific subjects: such as agricul-",
  "ture,industry,powerandfuel,finance,socialservicesandeven\u2018women\u2019srole",
  "in planned economy\u2019. The NPC outlined \u2018national self-sufficiency\u2019 and the",
  "doubling of living standards in ten years as the main goals. Planning itself",
  "was defined as \u2018the technical co-ordination, by disinterested experts, of con-sumption, production, investment, trade, and income distribution, in accord-",
  "ance with social objectives set by bodies representative of the nation\u2019.9",
  "From Japan and Russia the NPC took the lesson that countries that in-",

  "Notably, the private sector concurred. In 1944 a group of leading indus-",
  "trialists issued what they called A Plan of Economic Development for India",
  "(more commonly known as the Bombay Plan). This conceded that \u2018the ex-",
  "isting economic organization, based on private enterprise and ownership, has",
  "failed to bring about a satisfactory distribution of the national income\u2019. Only",
  "the state could help \u2018diminish inequalities of income\u2019. But the state was ne-",
  "cessary for augmenting production too. Energy, infrastructure and transport",
  "were sectors where the Indian capitalists themselves felt the need for a gov-",

  "the positive as well as preventative functions of the State is essential to any",
  "large-scale economic planning\u2019.11",
  "Now largely forgotten, the Bombay Plan gives the lie to the claim that",
  "Jawaharlal Nehru imposed a model of centralized economic development on",
  "an unwilling capitalist class. One wonders what free-market pundits would",
  "make of it now. They would probably see it as a dirigiste tract, unworthy of",

  "government set up a Planning Commission to carry out these \u2018directive prin-",
  "ciples\u2019. Chaired by Nehru, the Commission included high Cabinet ministers",
  "as well as experienced members of the Indian Civil Service.In the summer of 1951 the Planning Commission issued a draft of the",
  "first five-year plan. This focused on agriculture, the sector hardest hit by Par-",
  "tition. Besides increasing food production, the other major emphases of the",
  "plan were on the development of transport and communications, and the pro-",
  "vision of social services. Introducing the proposals in Parliament, Jawaharla",

  "While introducing the first plan, Nehru had said that \u2018it was obvious to",
  "methatwehavetoindustrialiseIndia,andasrapidlyaspossible\u2019.Thatobject-",

  "\u2013 in sum, \u2018an awesome polyglot, the kind of man for whom Nehru was guar-",
  "anteed to fall\u2019.16",
  "Mahalanobis was, among other things, the man who brought modern",
  "statistics to India. In 1931 he setup the Indian Statistical Institute (ISI) in Cal-",
  "cutta. Within a decade, he had made the ISI a world-class centre of training",
  "and research. He was also a pioneer of inter-disciplinary research, innovat-",
  "ively applying his statistical techniques in the fields of anthropology, agro-",
  "nomy and meteorology.",
  "In February 1949, Mahalanobis was appointed honorary statistical ad-",
  "viser to the Union Cabinet. The next year he helped establish the National",
  "Sample Survey (NSS) and the year following, the Central Statistical Organ-",
  "ization (CSO). These were setup to collect reliable data on changing living",
  "standards in India \u2013 on wages, employment, consumption and the like. The",
  "NSS and the CSO are two reasons why India has a set of official statistics",
  "more reliable than those found anywhere else in the non-Western world.17",
  "Such are the uncontentious aspects of Mahalanobis\u2019s legacy. Perhaps",
  "more important, and certainly more controversial, are his contributions to the",
  "theory and practice of planning. In 1954 Nehru committed his party, and byextension his country, to the creation of a \u2018socialistic pattern of society\u2019. The",
  "same year, the ISI was asked by the government to study the problem of un-",
  "employment. Mahalanobis wrote a note on the subject, which seems to have",
  "impressed Nehru enough for him to assign the ISI responsibility for drafting",
  "the second five-year plan itself.",

  "their Indian counterparts around to his own point of view. As he told a friend,",
  "\u2018at the back of everything is one single aim in my own mind \u2013 what effective",
  "help can we secure in making our own plans and in implementing them\u2019.18",
  "Mahalanobis first went to the United States of America, where he col-",
  "lected information on input\u2013output coefficients, these maintained in a deck",
  "of 40,000 Hollerith punched cards. He talked to the man who had done the",
  "work (Wassily Leontief, a future Nobellaureate), before crossing the Atlantic",
  "to meet the dons of Cambridge. The \u2018most brilliant\u2019 of these was Joan Robin-",
  "son, then just back from a trip to China (where she was \u2018much impressed",
  "by the progress they are making\u2019.) She thought that the export\u2013import sector",
  "in India needed more government control. Mahalanobis agreed, and in turn",
  "asked Joan Robinson to visit India as a guest of the ISI. This, he told her,",
  "\u2018might be of very great help to us because her support may carry conviction",
  "thatourapproachtoDevelopmentplanningisnotfoolish.Shesmiledandsaid",
  "\u2013\u201cYes, Ithink Iwould be able to knock some sense into the heads ofthe eco-",
  "nomists in your country.\u201d\u2019",
  "Mahalanobis now crossed the Channel, to converse with the French",
  "Marxists. Then it was time to shift to the other side of the Iron Curtain. He",
  "reached Moscow via Prague, and was at once impressed by the \u2018amazing\u2019",
  "pace of construction work: buildings far bigger, and built much faster, than",
  "any he had ever seen. He had long talks with Soviet academicians, who said",
  "that if India wanted \u2018to do any serious planning we must have the active help",
  "of, not scores, but hundreds of technologists and scientists and engineers\u2019.",
  "Mahalanobis agreed,andinvitedthemtovisithiscountry,sourgentlyinneed",
  "of \u2018specialists and experts in the economics of planning\u2019.19",
  "These travels and talks finally bore fruit in a long paper presented to the",
  "Planning Commission in March 1954. Here Mahalanobis outlined eight ob-",
  "jectives for the second five-year plan. The first of these was \u2018to attain a rapid",
  "growthofthenationaleconomybyincreasingthescopeandimportanceofthepublic sector and in this way to advance to a socialistic pattern of society\u2019;",
  "thesecond,\u2018todevelopbasicheavyindustriesforthemanufactureofproducer",
  "goodstostrengthenthefoundationofeconomicindependence\u2019.Other(andwe",
  "may presume lesser) objectives included the production of consumer goods",
  "by both the factory and household sector, the increasing of agricultural pro-",
  "ductivity and the provision of better housing, health and education facilities.",
  "The emphasis on capital goods was justified in two principal ways. The",
  "first was that it would safeguard this former colony\u2019s economic, and hence",
  "political, independence. The second was that it would help solve the press-",
  "ing problem of unemployment. \u2018Unemployment is chronic because of [the",
  "unavailability of] capital goods\u2019, argued Mahalanobis; it occurs \u2018only when",
  "means of production become idle\u2019. The quickest way to create jobs was to",
  "build dams and factories.20",
  "Mahalanobis\u2019s draft plan was submitted to a panel of expert economists.",
  "With one exception, all endorsed the emphasis on capital goods and the role",
  "of the public sector. To be sure, there were a number of specific caveats.",
  "Some economists urged a greater complementarity of agricultural and indus-",
  "trial production; others worried about where the funds for the plan would",
  "come from. Increasing taxes would not by themselves suffice, while deficit",
  "financing might lead to high inflation.",

  "But, on the whole, the leading economists of India were behind what was",
  "already being called \u2018the Mahalanobis Model of Planning\u2019.21",
  "This model was, among other things, an evocation of the old nationalist",
  "model of swadeshi, or self-reliance. Once, Gandhian protesters had burnt for-",
  "eign cloth to encourage the growth of indigenous textiles; now, Nehruvian",
  "technocrats would make their own steel and machine tools rather than buy",
  "themfromoutside.Asthesecondplanargued,underdevelopmentwas\u2018essen-",
  "tially a consequence of insufficient technological progress\u2019.22 Self-reliance,",
  "from this perspective, became the index of development and progress. From",
  "soap to steel, cashew to cars, Indians would meet their material requirements",
  "by using Indian land, Indian labour, Indian materials and, above all, Indian",
  "technology.",
  "Table 10.1 compares the sectoral outlays for the first and second plans.",
  "Inproportionaltermsthesectorsofpower,transportandcommunications,and",
  "social services, retained broadly the same importance. The decisive shift was",
  "from agriculture to industry, this compounded by a decline in the importance",
  "of irrigation.",
  "While the heavy industries would be owned by the state, there was still",
  "plenty of room for private enterprise. For in \u2018an expanding economy the",
  "private sector would have an assured market\u2019. Their main contribution would",
  "come in the form of consumer goods, these to be produced by units large as",
  "well as small.23",
  "Agovernmentresolutionof1956classifiednewindustriesintothreecat-",
  "egories. Class I would be the \u2018exclusive responsibility of the state; these in-",
  "cluded atomic energy, defence-related industries, aircraft, iron and steel, elec-",
  "tricitygenerationandtransmission,heavyelectricals,telephones,andcoaland",
  "other key minerals. Class II would witness both public and private sector par-",
  "ticipation;herefellthelesserminerals,chemicals,pharmaceuticals,fertilizers,",
  "pulp and paper, and road transport. Class III consisted of all the remaining in-",
  "dustries, to be undertaken \u2018ordinarily through the initiative and enterprise of",
  "the private sector\u2019.24Would the Mahalanobis model succeed? Many Indians thought so, most",
  "Indians certainly hoped so. So did their sympathizers worldwide. Represent-",
  "ative here are the views of J. B. S. Haldane, the great British biologist who",
  "wasthenplanningtomovetoIndiaandtheISI.Whenshownthedraftplanby",
  "Mahalanobis, Haldane commented that",
  "Even if one is pessimistic, and allows a 15 per cent chance of failure",
  "through interference by the United States (via Pakistan or otherwise), a",
  "10 per cent chance of interference by the Soviet Union and China, a 20",
  "percentchanceofinterferencewithcivilservicetraditionalismandpolit-",
  "ical obstruction, and a 5 percent chance of interference by Hindu tradi-",
  "tionalism, that leaves a 50 per cent chance for a success which will alter",
  "the whole history of the world for the better.25",
  "III",
  "If Mahalanobis was the chief technician of Indian planning, then Nehru was",
  "its chief missionary. The prime minister believed that, in the Indian context,",
  "planningwasmuchmorethanrationaleconomics.Itwasgoodpoliticsaswell.",
  "While the plan was based on the work of economists and statisticians, to real-",
  "ize its goal the \u2018people must have the sensation of partnership in a mighty",
  "enterprise, of being fellow-travellers towards the next goal that they and we",
  "havesetbeforeus\u2019.Popularparticipationwastheonlywaytomake\u2018thisPlan,",
  "which is enshrined in cold print, something living, vital and dynamic, which",
  "captures the imagination of our people\u2019.26",
  "Planning was thus a \u2018mighty co-operative effort of all the people of In-",
  "dia\u2019. Nehru hoped that the new projects would be a solvent to dissolve the",
  "schisms of caste and religion, community and region. Introducing the first",
  "plan to his chief ministers, he wrote that \u2018the more we think of this balanced",
  "picture ofthewhole ofIndiaandofits many-sided activities, which aresoin-",
  "terrelated with one another, the less we are likely to go astray in the crooked",
  "paths of provincialism, communalism, casteism and all other disruptive and",
  "disintegrating tendencies\u2019. Introducing the second plan, he called it a \u2018brave",
  "effort to fashion our future\u2019, that will \u2018require all the strength and energy that",
  "we possess\u2019. He believed that \u2018ultimately this is the only way to deal with the",
  "separatism, provincialism and sectarianism that we have to combat\u2019.27On the economic side, Nehru singled out two activities as providing the",
  "\u2018essential bases\u2019 for planning: the production of power and the production",
  "of steel.28 At Independence, India had only two steel plants, both privately",
  "owned, which produced just over a million tones a year. This was inadequate",
  "foranexpandingeconomy,moresoonethathadcommitteditselftothebuild-",
  "ing of heavy industries.",
  "The private sector was barred from starting new enterprises in steel,",
  "which, along with coal, shipbuilding, atomic energy and aircraft production,",
  "was deemed too important to be subject to the profit motive. The forest belt",
  "that runs across central India was rich in iron ore and coal, and it had plenty",
  "of rivers too. At once a lively competition began between the states that com-",
  "prised this belt, each seeking to have the first public-sector steel plant with",
  "in its borders. This was paralleled by a competition between the industrial-",
  "izedcountriesoftheWest,eachofwhomwantedthecontracttobuildthefirst",
  "plant.29",
  "The second plan had set a target of 6 million tonnes of steel. The output",
  "wasneededtoprovideinputstootherplannedindustries.Butitwasalsoaway",
  "of promoting forced savings. As one economist famously put it, \u2018you can\u2019t",
  "eat steel\u2019. While the second plan was being finalized, the Indian government",
  "signedthreeseparateagreementsfortheconstructionofsteelplants.TheGer-",

  "MadhyaPradesh,theBritishoneinDurgapurinWestBengal.TheAmericans,",
  "much to their sorrow, had lost out. That the war-ravaged countries of Europe",
  "had grabbed two contracts was bad enough, that their hated Cold War rivals",
  "had taken the third was worse. Years later an American friend remembered",
  "how the decision that Bhilai was going to the Russians was communicated",
  "over the radio in tones of palpable sadness by the fabled broadcaster Ed Mur-",
  "row.30",
  "The Russians, of course, were delighted. Nikita Khrushchev visited",
  "Bhilai and called it the \u2018Magnitogorsk of India\u2019. Pravda ran lavish photo fea-",

  "us were helping build the future \u2013 a future one could almost see, touch, and",
  "feel.\u2019 Finally, in February 1959, under the benign eyes of the president of In-",
  "dia, the first flush of molten iron came out of a blast furnace in Bhilai. All",
  "around there were tears of joy and rejoicing. Those who were there long re-",

  "IV",
  "In the economic modernization of India, large dams occupied a rather special",
  "place. They would, on the one hand, emancipate agriculture from the tyranny",
  "of the monsoon and, on the other, provide the electric power to run the new",
  "industries mandated by the five-year plans. Jawaharlal Nehru was enchanted",
  "by dams, which he called \u2018the temples of modern India\u2019. His fascination was",
  "sharedbymillionsofhiscountry-men,whotoocametoveneratethesetower-",
  "ing new monuments built in mud and concrete.",
  "Indian intellectuals greatly admired the Tennessee Valley Authority, the",
  "integrated project that was a cornerstone of Franklin Roosevelt\u2019s New Deal.",
  "But they also admired the massive multipurpose projects undertaken in the",
  "Soviet Union. In the 1940s, anticipating Independence, scientists and engin-",
  "eers made trips to America and Russia to acquaint themselves at first hand",
  "withhowdamswerebuilt.Theyweredeeplyimpressedwithwhattheysaw.34",
  "On either side of the Iron Curtain, these projects represented \u2018the triumph",
  "of science, technology, foresight and centralized government over politics,",
  "petty local authorities and powers, ignorance, superstition, and backward-",
  "ness\u2019. They represented, indeed, \u2018the salvation of the nation through rational-",
  "ity and strength\u2019.35Like North America and Russia, the subcontinent had numerous large",
  "rivers.Dammingandtamingtheseriverswouldkillthreebirdswithonestone;",
  "generating electricity, providing water for irrigation and preventing flooding.",
  "Afteraparticularly lethal boutoffloodingontheGodavari inthemonsoonof",
  "1953, a leading engineer wrote to a leading politician that this was a river",
  "with enormous potential for good. The destruction caused by floods of",
  "this year has, however, demonstrated that if these flood waters are not",
  "harnessed for beneficial use, they will constitute a potential threat to the",
  "well-beingofthepeople.Properlyconserved,thesefloodwaterswillsat-",
  "isfy all the needs of the Godavari basin and leave ample reserves, which",
  "integratedwiththeKrishnawaterswillenableirrigationandpowerbene-",
  "fits to be extended right down to Madras and further south . . . No effort",
  "should therefore be spared in harnessing of the Godavari waters, in op-",
  "timum integration with the Krishna, nor extraneous reasons permitted to",
  "delay or jeopardise their consummation.36",
  "Here was a proselytizing technocrat speaking to the already converted. For",
  "while the Godavari was still undammed, most of the other major rivers had",
  "already come under the hand of man. Among the massive dam projects under",
  "way were those on the Mahanadi, Rihand, Tungabhadra, Damodar and Sutlej",
  "rivers.",
  "In the mid-1950s the political scientist Henry Hart wrote a lyrical ac-",
  "count of the transformation of \u2018New India\u2019s Rivers\u2019. For Hart, these projects",
  "were \u2018the greatest of the monuments of free India\u2019; to them \u2018men and women",
  "come, in a pilgrimage growing season by season, to see for themselves the",
  "dams and canals and power stations\u2019.",
  "In the book, there is a particularly fine description of the construction of",
  "the Tungabhadra dam. When finished, the dam would embody 32 million cu-",
  "bicfeetofmasonry;theselaidattherateof40,000cubicfeetaday,everyday",
  "for five years. The sheer scale could properly be conveyed only by means of",
  "analogy. \u2018Imagine the masonry in Tungabhadra Dam\u2019, wrote Hart, \u2018being laid",
  "as a highway, 20 feet wide, 6 inches thick. It would extend from Luck now to",
  "Calcutta, or from Bombay to Madras.\u201937",
  "Without question the most prestigious of all these schemes was the",
  "Bhakra\u2013Nangal project in northern India. Again, its scale is best narrated in",
  "numbers. At 680 feet, the Bhakra dam was the second highest in the world;",
  "only the Grand Coulee Dam, on the Colorado river, was higher. The concreteand masonry that would finally go into it was estimated at 500 million cu-",
  "bic feet, \u2018more than twice the cubic contents of the seven great pyramids of",
  "Egypt\u2019. The project would generate nearly a million kilowatts of electricity,",
  "while the water from the reservoir would irrigate 7.4 million acres of land,",
  "thiscarried incanals forwhoseexcavation 30million cubic yardsofmudand",
  "stone had to be removed.38",
  "This project was a form of compensation for the refugee farmers from",
  "West Punjab, a substitute for the canal colonies they had left behind on the",
  "other side of the border. These peasants, predominantly Sikh, had \u2018a martyr-",
  "like yearning to recreate within their own lifetimes the prosperity of which",
  "theyhavebeencruellydeprived\u2019.Bhakra-Nangalgavethem\u2018thefieldandthe",

  "themmore\u2013forinadditiontothewatertherewaspower,fromwhichthePun-",
  "jabis could, if they so chose, for the first time build an industrial future for",
  "themselves.",
  "The Bhakra\u2013Nangal project was described in minute detail in a special",
  "issue of the Indian Journal of Power and River Valley Development. The",
  "issue opened with a set off our most revealing photographs. The first showed",
  "the densely wooded site before work began \u2013 it carried the caption, \u2018River",
  "Sutlej at Bhakra in its primeval splendour \u2013 the site as it was\u2019. The second",
  "showed crane-like structures in the water and a low bridge slung across the",
  "gorge: this was \u2018Exploratory drilling in river bed with drills mounted on pon-",
  "toons \u2013 the first invasion\u2019. The third photo, taken apparently in the dry sea-",
  "son, showed hillsides by now quite bare, with trucks and bulldozers on the",
  "riverbed. Thus \u2018Concreting of the Dam begins \u2013 man lays the foundation for",
  "changing nature\u2019. In the last photo, the dam had begun to rise, aided by ma-",
  "chines of a shape and size never before seen in India. This was \u2018Excavation",
  "with heavy machines in progress in pit-area \u2013 the struggle with nature\u2019.39",
  "The men and women who worked at Bhakra were all Indian, with one",
  "exception. This was an American, Harvey Slocum. Slocum had little formal",
  "education;startingoutasalabourerinasteelmill,hehadrisentotheposition",
  "of construction superintendent on the Grand Coulee dam. Slocum joined the",
  "Bhakra team as chief engineer in 1952 and imprinted upon it his own dis-",
  "tinctive style of working. Officers and workers of all levels were mandated to",
  "dress uniformly. Slocum himself was at the site at 8 a.m. sharp, staying there",
  "until late evening. A stern disciplinarian, he could not abide the sloth and in-",
  "efficiency that was rampant around him. Once, when the telephone system",
  "brokedown,hewrotetotheprimeministerinforminghimthat\u2018onlyGod,not",

  "atetheproject.Asheflickedontheswitchofthepowerhouse,Dakotasofthe",
  "Indian air force dipped their wings overhead. Next he opened the sluice gates",
  "of the dam. Seeing the water coming towards them, the villagers downstream",
  "set off hundreds of home-made crackers. As one eyewitness wrote, \u2018For 150",
  "miles the boisterous celebration spread like a chain reaction along the great",
  "canalandthebranchesanddistributariestotheedgesoftheRajasthanDesert,",
  "long before the water got there.\u201941",

  "In the push to industrialize India, a key role had to be played by technology",
  "andtechnologists.SincehisdaysasastudentatCambridge,JawaharlalNehru",
  "had been fascinated by modern science. \u2018Science is the spirit of the age and",

  "researchlaboratories wassetup.These,followingtheFrenchmodel,werees-",
  "tablished independently, outside of the existing universities. Within the ambit",
  "of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research were some two dozen",
  "individual institutes. There was a strong utilitarian agenda at work, with sci-",
  "entists in these laboratories encouraged to develop new products for Indians",
  "rather than publish academic papers in foreign journals.43",
  "An Indian scientist whom Nehru patronized early and consistently was",
  "the brilliant Cambridge-educated physicist Homi Bhabha. Bhabha founded",
  "and directed two major scientific institutions. The first was the Tata Institute",
  "of Fundamental Research in Bombay whose work, as its name implies, was",
  "aimedmostlyatbasicresearch.Ithadworld-classdepartments ofphysicsand",
  "mathematics and also, in time, housed India\u2019s first mainframe computer. The",
  "second was the Atomic Energy Commission, mandated to build and run In-",
  "dia\u2019s nuclear power plants. This was handsomely funded by the government",
  "with an annual budget, in 1964, of about Rs100 million.44Many new engineering schools were also started. These included the",
  "flagship Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs), five of which were inaugur-",
  "atedbetween1954and1964.Likethenewlaboratories,thenewcollegeswere",
  "intended to augment indigenous technical capability. Both Nehru and Bhabha",
  "were determined to lessen India\u2019s dependence on the West for scientific ma-",
  "terialsandknow-how.Theybelievedthat\u2018ifanitemofequipmentwasimpor-",
  "ted from abroad, all one got was that particular instrument. But if one built it",
  "oneself, an all-important lesson in expertise was learnt as well\u2019.45",
  "VI",
  "The industrial bias of Indian planning was tempered by a range of pro-",
  "grammes promoting agrarian uplift. On the morning of 2 October 1952 (Ma-",
  "hatma Gandhi\u2019s birthday), the president of India inaugurated a nationwide",
  "series of community development programmes with abroad-cast over the ra-",
  "dio. Fifty-five projects were launched across India that day, these funded",
  "jointlybythegovernmentsofIndiaandtheUnitedStates.Amongtheschemes",
  "to be promoted by community development were roads and wells, cattle wel-",
  "fare and improved methods of cultivation.",
  "The projects were launched by ministers, chief ministers, and commis-",
  "sioners. These dignitaries helped remove earth for building roads and laid",
  "foundation stones for schools and hospitals. In Alipur village, twelve miles",
  "out of Delhi on the road to Karnal, Jawaharlal Nehru dug into the earth to",
  "help prepare a road. \u2018With verve and vigour he plunged into the work, having",
  "taken his jacket off.\u2019 His companion, the American ambassador, also carried",
  "some baskets of earth. Not everyone was as agile as these two. When a well-",
  "dressed official attempted to emulate the prime minister the villagers shouted",
  "\u2018Sarparl!Sarparl\u2019\u2013meaning,\u2018Carrythebasketsonyourhead,youfool,not",
  "with your hands!\u2019 Speaking to the villagers, Nehru said that community de-",
  "velopment would bring about a rural revolution by peaceful means, not, as in",
  "other places, by the breaking of heads.46",
  "Howdidtheseschemesworkinpractice?Twoyearsaftertheybegan,the",
  "anthropologist S. C. Dube studied a community development project in west-",
  "ern Uttar Pradesh. He looked at the project from the viewpoint of the village-",
  "level worker (VLW), the government functionary mandated with taking new",
  "ideas to the peasants.ByDube\u2019saccount,these\u2018agentsofchange\u2019certainlyhadenergyanden-",
  "terprise. They got up at the crack of dawn, and worked all day. Among their",
  "duties were the demonstration to the villagers of the merits of new seeds and",
  "chemical fertilizers. These were tried on sample plots, the peasants looking",
  "onastheVLWexplainedscientificmethodsofdibbling.Differentcropswere",
  "sown, and different combinations of fertilizers used. The VLW also offered",
  "the villagers free angrezi khad (English manure) for use on their fields.",
  "It appears that the peasants of the UP were somewhat ambivalent about",
  "the new techniques. Here is a conversation between the VLW and a farmer",
  "known only by his initials, \u2018MS\u2019:",
  "VLW: What do you think of the new seed?",
  "What can I think? If the government thinks it is good, it must be",
  "MS:",
  "good.",
  "VLW: Do you think it is better than the local variety?",
  "Yes.Itresistsdiseasemuchbetter.Itcanstandfrostandrain,and",
  "MS:",
  "there is more demand for it in the market.",
  "VLW: What about yield?",
  "MS: I cannot say. Some people say it is more, others say it is not.",
  "VLW: Some people say it is not as good in taste.",
  "They are right. It is not half as good. If the roti [bread] is served",
  "hot it is more or less the same, but if we keep it for an hour or so",
  "MS:",
  "it gets as tough as hide. No, it is not as good in taste. People say",
  "that we all get very weak if we eat this wheat.",
  "VLW: What is your experience?",
  "Many more people suffer from digestive disorders these days.",
  "Our children have coughs and colds. Perhaps it is because of the",

  "tion. With irrigation came new crops such as paddy and sugar cane. These",
  "were sold outside the village for a handsome return. Paddy gave a profit after",
  "expenses of Rs136 per acre; sugar cane as much as Rs980 per acre. These",
  "changes in local economics fostered changes in lifestyle as well. Before the",
  "canals arrived, the residents of Wangala wore scruffy clothes and rarely ven-",

  "Independence, the different states passed legislation abolishing the zamindari",
  "system which, under the British, had bestowed effective rights of ownership",

  "the Soviets only underlined the importance of the state direction of economic",
  "development.52",
  "Tobesure,thereweredissenters.IntheWesttherewasFriedrichHayek,",
  "who advocated a retreat of the state from economic activity. His ideas,",
  "however, were treated with benign \u2013 and sometimes not-so-benign \u2013 con-",
  "tempt. (He could not even get a position in the Department of Economics in",
  "the University of Chicago, being placed instead in the \u2018Committee on Social",
  "Thought\u2019.) And in India there was B. R. Shenoy, the sole economist in the",
  "panel of experts who disagreed with the basic approach of the second five-",
  "year plan. As one commentator wrote, Shenoy \u2018appeared to be committed to",
  "laissez-faire methods in so doctrinaire a manner that no one, outside certain",
  "business circles, took much note of his criticisms\u2019.53",
  "In truth, Shenoy\u2019s arguments went beyond a mere belief in laissez faire.",
  "While he opposed the \u2018general extension of nationalisation on principle\u2019, his",
  "main criticism of the plan was that it was overambitious. It had, he thought,",
  "seriously overestimated the rate of savings in the Indian economy. The short-",
  "fall in funds would have to be made up by deficit financing, contributing to",
  "greater inflation.54",
  "Another dissenter was the Chicago economist Milton Friedman. Visiting",
  "India in 1955 at the invitation of the government, he wrote a memorandum",
  "setting out his objections to the Mahalanobis model. He thought it too math-",
  "ematical: obsessed by capital\u2013output ratios, rather than by the developmentof human capital. He deplored the emphasis in industrial policy on the two",
  "extremes \u2013 large factories that used too little labour and cottage industries",
  "that used too much. As he saw it, the \u2018basic requisites\u2019 of economic policy",
  "in a developing country were \u2018a steady and moderately expansionary monet-",
  "ary framework, greatly widened opportunities for education and training, im-",
  "proved facilities for transportation and communication to promote the mobil-",
  "ity not only of goods but even more important of people, and an environment",
  "that gives maximum scope to the initiatives and energy of farmers, business-",
  "men, and traders\u2019.55",
  "Independently of Friedman, a young Indian economist had taken up one",
  "aspect of this critique \u2013 the neglect of education. The constitution mandated",
  "free and compulsory schooling for children up to the age of fourteen. But the",
  "sums allocated for this by the second plan, wrote B. V. Krishnamurti, were",
  "\u2018absurdly low\u2019. He called for a \u2018substantial increase\u2019 in the allotment for edu-",
  "cation, the budget being balanced by an \u2018appropriate curtailment in the outlay",
  "onheavyindustries\u2019.Attentiontodetailwasalsocrucial\u2013totheenhancement",
  "ofthesocialprestigeoftheschoolteacher,tohighersalariesforthem,tobetter",
  "buildings and playgrounds for the children. As Krishnamurti argued:",
  "A concerted effort on these lines to educate the mass of the population,",
  "speciallyintheruralareas,wouldundoubtedlyhavefar-reachingbenefits",
  "of a cumulatively expansionist character. This would greatly lighten the",
  "task of the Government in bringing about rapid economic development.",
  "For in a reasonable time, one could expect that the ignorance and iner-",
  "tia of the people would crumble and an urge to improve one\u2019s material",
  "conditions by utilising the available opportunities would develop. If this",
  "were to happen, the employment problem would take care of itself. The",
  "peopleofthecountrywouldbegintomovealongthelinesofthoseinthe",
  "advanced democratic countries such as Great Britain and Switzerland.56",
  "IfB.V.Krishnamurtihadbeenaprofessorinthecentreofpower,Delhi,rather",
  "than a lowly lecturer in Bombay, he might have got a hearing. In Friedman\u2019s",
  "case,hishighpositionandprestigewereoffsetbyforeigneconomistsofequal",
  "distinction but of opposing views. He was to them what B. R. Shenoy was to",
  "Indian economists \u2013 a lone free-marketeer drowned out by a chorus of social",
  "democrats and leftists.57",
  "A critique of a different kind came from the Marxists. They thought that",
  "the Mahalanobis model gave not too little importance to the market, but toomuch.Thesecondplan,theyfelt,shouldhavemandatedathoroughgoingpro-",
  "cess of nationalization, whereby the state would not merely start new indus-",
  "tries, but take under its wing the private firms already in operation. They",
  "wanted the working class to be involved with planning, on the model of the",
  "\u2018people\u2019s democracies\u2019 of Eastern Europe.58",
  "Then there were the Gandhians, who provided a precocious ecological",
  "critiqueofmoderndevelopment.Inthevanguardofthis\u2018earlyenvironmental-",
  "ism\u2019 were two of the Mahatma\u2019s closest disciples, J. C. Kumarappa and Mira",

  "should be managed from the point of view of water conservation rather than",
  "revenue maximization (by protecting natural multispecies forests rather than",
  "themonocultural standsfavouredbythestate). These specific criticisms were",
  "part of a wider understanding of the world of nature. As Mira Behn wrote in",
  "1949:",
  "The tragedy today is that educated and moneyed classes are altogether",
  "outoftouchwiththevitalfundamentalsofexistence\u2013ourMotherEarth,",
  "and the animal and vegetable population which she sustains. This world",

  "may get huge returns for a time, but ultimately will come desolation. We",

  "OnemoderntechnologytheGandhianshaddeepreservationsaboutwerelarge",
  "dams. They thought them costly and destructive of nature. But, as Indians",
  "were soon finding out, dams were destructive of human community as well.",
  "By the early 1950s reports began appearing of the sufferings of those dis-",
  "placed by dams. In the summer of 1952, when the Hirakud authorities issued",
  "eviction notices to the residents of the 150 villages the project would sub-",
  "merge, they met with stiff resistance. A reporter on the spot concluded that",
  "\u2018the prosperity of Hirakud will be built on the sacrifice of such people who",

  "The free-market critique; the human capital critique; the ecological critique \u2013",
  "these make for fascinating reading today. But at the time these notes of dis-",
  "sent were scattered, and they were politically weak. There was then an over-",
  "whelming consensus in favour of a heavy industry-oriented, state-supported",
  "model of development. This was a consensus among intellectuals; no fewer",
  "than twenty-three of the twenty-four expert economists asked to comment on",
  "the Mahalanobis plan agreed with it in principle.61",
  "Thisconsensuswassharedbylargesectionsoftherulingclassaswell.In",

  "Congress nationalism suffered a body blow at Independence. Freedom",

  "Ambedkar. Both were of a modernist cast of mind, and both were trained in",

  "anotherclauseintheconstitution:thefreedomtopropagateandpractiseone\u2019s",
  "religion.2",
  "These arguments were forcefully refuted by B. R. Ambedkar. As he saw",
  "it, \u2018if personal laws are to be saved, . . . in social matters we will come to a",
  "standstill\u2019. In traditional societies, religion presumed to hold a \u2018vast, expans-",
  "ive jurisdiction so as to cover the whole of life\u2019. But in a modern democracy",
  "this licence had to be curtailed, if only \u2018in order to reform our social system,",
  "which is so full of inequities, so full of inequalities, discriminations and other",
  "things, which conflict with our fundamental rights\u2019. To assuage the misgiv-",
  "ings, Ambedkar said that the state might choose to apply a uniform civil code",
  "by consent, that is, only to those who chose voluntarily to submit to it.3",
  "As it happened, during the last years of their rule the British had be-",
  "latedly initiated the framing of a uniform code for Hindus. This sought to re-concile the prescriptions of the two principal schools of law \u2013 the Mitakshara",
  "and the Dayabhaga \u2013 and their numerous local variations. A committee had",
  "been setup in 1941 chaired by Sir B. N. Rau, who was also to play a crucial",
  "roleindraftingtheIndianConstitution.ThecommitteetouredIndia,soliciting",
  "a wide spectrum of Hindu opinion on the changes they proposed. Their pro-",
  "gress was interrupted by the war, but by 1946 they had prepared a draft of a",
  "personal law code to be applied to all Hindus.4",
  "That the Hindus were singled out was in part because they were the",
  "largest community, and in part because there was a vigorous reform move-",
  "ment among them. Mahatma Gandhi, in particular, had challenged the dis-",
  "criminations of caste and gender, by seeking the abolition of untouchability",
  "and bringing women into public life. Although there remained an influential",
  "orthodox section, modernist Hindus had campaigned strongly for laws that",
  "would make caste irrelevant and enhance the rights of women.",
  "In 1948 the Constituent Assembly formed a Select Committee to review",
  "the draft of a new Hindu code. It was chaired by B. R. Ambedkar, the law",
  "minister. The code drafted by the Rau Committee was revised by Ambedkar",

  "Despiteitsname,the\u2018Hindu\u2019CodeBillwastoapplytoSikhs,Buddhists",

  "thePrivyCouncil,[and]whichformabewilderingmotleytothecommonman",
  "andgiverisetoconstantlitigation\u2019.Thecodificationhadadualpurpose:first,",
  "to elevate the rights and status of Hindu women; second, to do away with the",
  "disparities and divisions of caste. Among the notable features of the proposed",
  "legislation were:",
  "1. The awarding, to the widow and daughter, of the same share as the",
  "son(s) in the property of a man dying intestate (which in the past had",
  "passed only to his male heirs). Likewise, a Hindu woman\u2019s estate, previ-",
  "ously limited, was now made absolute, to be disposed of as she wished.",
  "2. The granting of maintenance to the wife who chose to live separately",
  "from the husband if he had a \u2018loathsome disease\u2019, was cruel to her, took",
  "a concubine, etc.",
  "3. Abolition of the rules of caste and sub-caste in sanctifying a marriage.",
  "All marriages between Hindus would have the same sacramental as wellas legal status, regardless of the castes to which the spouses belonged.",
  "Aninter-castemarriagecouldnowbesolemnizedinaccordancewiththe",
  "customs and rites of either party.",
  "4. Allowing either partner to file for and obtain divorce on certain",
  "grounds, such as cruelty, infidelity, incurable disease, etc.",
  "5. Making monogamy mandatory.",
  "6. Allowing for the adoption of children belonging to a different caste.",
  "These changes went very far in the direction of gender equity. Later, much",
  "later, feminist scholars were to argue that they did not go far enough, that",
  "they exempted agricultural properties from their provisions, for example, or",
  "that the advantages conferred on female heirs by the new laws were greater",
  "in the case of self-acquired property as compared to property that was inher-",
  "ited.5 But from the viewpoint of Hindu orthodoxy the changes had already",
  "gone far enough. They constituted radical departures from the main body of",
  "Hindu law, where the son had a much larger claim on his father\u2019s property as",
  "compared to the wife and daughter, where marriage was considered a sacra-",
  "ment and hence indissoluble, where the man was allowed to take more than",
  "one wife, and where marriage was governed strictly by the rules of caste.",
  "In defending these changes, Ambedkar was at times rather defensive.",
  "Thus he argued that the Shastras, the Hindu holy texts, did not give the",
  "husband \u2018an unfettered, unqualified right to polygamy\u2019. The \u2018right to marry",
  "a second time has been considerably limited by the [ancient law maker]",
  "Kautilya\u2019.Again,thecustomarylawofthevariouslowcastes,orshudras,had",
  "always allowed divorce. As for the woman\u2019s right to property, some schools",
  "allowed her a quarter share in her father\u2019s property; all Ambedkar had done",
  "was to \u2018raise [the daughter] up in the share of heirs\u2019, by making her share full",
  "and equal to that of the son.6",
  "Ambedkar was here putting the best possible, or most liberal, spin on",
  "Hindu texts and traditions. But alternative interpretations were possible, and",
  "certainly more plausible. Not surprisingly, Ambedkar\u2019s proposals provoked",
  "\u2018loud denunciations\u2019 from the orthodox, who viewed them as \u2018a complete ab-",
  "rogation of the Hindu customs and traditions\u2019, an unacceptable interference",
  "with the rules of caste and the traditional relations between the sexes.7",
  "A doughty opponent of the bill was the Constituent Assembly\u2019s own",
  "president, Rajendra Prasad. In June 1948, shortly after the Select Committeehad been set up, Prasad warned the prime minister that to introduce \u2018basic",
  "changes\u2019 in personal law was to impose the \u2018progressive ideas\u2019 of a \u2018micro-",
  "scopic minority\u2019 on the Hindu community as a whole. Nehru answered that",
  "the Cabinet had declared itself in favour of the bill, that \u2018personally, I am en-",
  "tirely in favour of the general principles embodied in it\u2019. To scrap the legisla-",
  "tion now would be to give rise to the suspicion that the Congress was \u2018a re-",
  "actionary and a very conservative body\u2019; nor would it go down well \u2018in the",
  "mind of foreigners outside India\u2019. Prasad shot back that the opinions of the",
  "\u2018vast bulk of [the] Hindu public\u2019 were more important than the views of for-",
  "eigners.8",
  "Within the Assembly there were other opponents as well. They stalled",
  "and thwarted the proceedings until Nehru, in high dudgeon, told them that to",
  "him the passing of the bill had become a matter of prestige. Prasad, in re-",
  "sponse, drafted a letter warning the prime minister that this would be \u2018un-",
  "justandundemocratic\u2019,asthis\u2018fundamentalandcontroversiallegislation\u2019had",

  "March1949,anAll-IndiaAnti-Hindu-Code-BillCommitteehadbeenformed.",
  "This held that the Constituent Assembly had \u2018no right to interfere with the",
  "personal laws of Hindus which are based on Dharma Shastras\u2019. Sixty (male)",
  "members of the Delhi Bar issued a statement objecting to the codification of",
  "Hindu law, on the grounds that \u2018the mass of the Hindus believe in the Divine",
  "Origin of their personal laws\u2019.",
  "The Anti-Hindu-Code-Bill Committee was supported by conservative",
  "lawyers as well as by conservative clerics. The influential Shankaracharya of",
  "Dwarkaissuedan\u2018encyclical\u2019againsttheproposedcode.Religion,hesaid,\u2018is",
  "the noblest light, inspiration and support of men, and the State\u2019s highest duty",
  "is to protect it\u2019.",
  "The Anti-Hindu-Code-Bill Committee held hundreds of meetings",
  "throughout India, where sundry swamis denounced the proposed legislation.",
  "The participants in this movement presented themselves as religious warriors",
  "(dharmaveer)fightingareligiouswar(dharmayudh).TheRashtriyaSwayam-sevak Sangh threw its weight behind the agitation. On 11 December 1949,",
  "the RSS organized a public meeting at the Ram Lila grounds in Delhi, where",
  "speaker after speaker condemned the bill. One called it \u2018an atom bomb on",
  "Hindusociety\u2019.AnotherlikenedittothedraconianRowlattActintroducedby",
  "the colonial state; just as the protests against that act led to the downfall of",
  "the British, he said, the struggle against this Bill would signal the downfall of",
  "Nehru\u2019s government. The next day a group of RSS workers marched on the",
  "Assembly buildings, shouting \u2018Down with Hindu code bill\u2019 and \u2018May Pan-",
  "dit Nehru perish\u2019. The protesters burnt effigies of the prime minister and Dr",
  "Ambedkar, and then vandalized the car of Sheikh Abdullah.",
  "The leader of the movement against the new bill was one Swami Karp-",
  "atriji Maharaj. We know little of this swami\u2019s antecedents, except that he was",
  "from north India and appeared to be knowledgeable in Sanskrit. His opposi-",
  "tiontotheBillwascolouredanddeepenedbythefactthatitwasbeingpiloted",
  "by Ambedkar. He made pointed references to the law minister\u2019s caste, sug-",
  "gesting that a former Untouchable had no business meddling in matters nor-",
  "mally the preserve of the Brahmin.",
  "In speeches in Delhi and elsewhere, Swami Karpatri challenged",
  "Ambedkar to a public debate on his interpretations of the Shastras. To the",
  "law minister\u2019s claim that the Shastras did not really favour polygamy, Swami",
  "Karpatri quoted Yagnavalkya: \u2018If the wife is a habitual drunkard, a confirmed",
  "invalid,acunning,abarrenoraspendthriftwoman,ifsheisbitter-tongued,if",
  "shehasgotonlydaughtersandnoson,ifshehatesherhusband,[then]thehus-",
  "band can marry a second wife even while the first is living.\u2019 The swami sup-",
  "pliedtheprecisecitationforthisinjunction:thethirdverseofthethirdchapter",
  "of the third section of Yagnavalkya\u2019s smriti (scripture) concerning marriage.",
  "He did not, however, tell us whether the injunction also allowed the wife to",
  "take another husband if the existing one was a drunkard, bitter-tongued, a",
  "spend-thrift, etc.",
  "ForSwamiKarpatri,divorcewasprohibitedinHindutradition,while\u2018to",
  "allow adoption of a boy of any caste is to defy the Shastras and to defy prop-",
  "erty\u2019. Even by the most liberal interpretations, the woman\u2019s inheritance was",
  "limited to one-eighth, not a half as Ambedkar sought to make it. The bill was",
  "altogether in violation of the Hindu scriptures. It had already evoked \u2018terrible",
  "opposition\u2019, and the government could push it through only at its peril. The",
  "swami issued a dire warning: \u2018As is clearly laid down in the Dharmashastras,",
  "to forcibly defy the laws of God and Dharma very often means great harm to",
  "the Government and the country and both bitterly rue the obstinate folly.\u201910III",
  "In December 1949, having agreed upon a constitution, the Constituent",
  "Assembly made way for a provisional Parliament, which was to be in place",
  "until thefirstgeneral election. Through1950and1951,NehruandAmbedkar",
  "made several attempts toget the HinduCode Bill passed into law.But the op-",
  "position was considerable, both within Parliament and outside it. To quote J.",
  "D.M.Derrett,\u2018everyargumentthatcouldbemusteredagainsttheprojectwas",
  "garnered,includingmanythatcancelledeachotherout\u2019.The\u2018offerofdivorce",
  "to all oppressed spouses became the chief target of attack, and the cry that re-",
  "ligion was in danger was raised by many whose real objection to the Bill was",
  "that daughters were to have equal shares with sons\u2019.11",
  "Within the provisional Parliament, orthodox members claimed that the",
  "Hindu laws had stayed unchanged from time immemorial. \u2018The rules of con-",
  "ductanddutiesofmeninourcountryaredeterminedbytheVedas\u2019,saidRam-",
  "narayan Singh. Despite the challenges down the ages \u2013 posed by Buddhism,",
  "IslamandChristianity\u2013\u2018theVedicreligiondidnotperish\u2019...[the]Vedicreli-",
  "gion is still there\u2019. But now, complained Ramnarayan Singh, \u2018we have Pandit",
  "Nehru\u2019s administration whose representative Dr Ambedkar wants to abrogate",
  "with a single stroke all those rules which have existed since the beginning of",
  "the world\u2019.",
  "Some parliamentarians argued that the government should frame and",
  "have passed an Indian code rather than a specifically Hindu one. \u2018I do not be-",
  "lieve that only Hindu women are oppressed\u2019, said Indra Vidyavachaspati. By",
  "passing the bill in its present form, the state would \u2018give encouragement to",
  "[the]evilofcommunalism\u2019.Ifitwasnotmadeapplicabletoallsectionsofthe",
  "populations, insisted Vidyavachaspati, then \u2018the feeling of communalism will",
  "arise and what should have been a boon will turn into a curse\u2019.",
  "Other members were happy enough with the bill as it was. \u2018While I ad-",
  "mire those who want to have one Civil Code for the whole of India\u2019, said",
  "Thakur Das Bhargava, \u2018I do not think that it would be a practical proposi-",
  "tion to have one Civil Code for Muslims, Christians, Jews, etc.\u2019. For Muslim",
  "members had already expressed their opposition to any tampering with their",
  "personal code, which they believed to be the revealed word of Allah himself.",
  "To ask at this stage for a uniform code was seen as a stalling tactic, diverting",
  "attentionfromthereformsourgentlyrequiredwithinthemajoritycommunity.",
  "As Dr Ambedkar put it, \u2018those who until yesterday were the greatest oppon-",
  "ents of this Code and the greatest champions of the archaic Hindu Law as itexists to-day\u2019, now claimed that they were \u2018prepared for an All-India Civil",
  "Code\u2019. This was because they hoped that while it had already taken \u2018four or",
  "five years to draft the Hindu Code [it] will probably take ten years to draft a",
  "Civil Code\u2019.",
  "Ambedkar knew that while there were enough influential Hindus \u2013 such",
  "as Jawaharlal Nehru \u2013 who were behind progressive legislation, among the",
  "Muslims the liberal contingent was nowhere near as strong. The government,",
  "he said, could not be so \u2018foolish\u2019 as \u2018not to realize the sentiments of different",
  "communities in this country\u2019. That was why the code at present dealt only",
  "withtheHindus.12",
  "Ofcourse,notallHinduswereoftheliberalpartyeither.Thereservations",
  "oftheorthodox,asexpressedinParliament,werecarriedforwardinthestreets",
  "by the cadres of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh. They brought batches of",
  "volunteers into New Delhi, to shout slogans against the Hindu Code Bill and",
  "court arrest. Among their larger aims were the dismemberment of Pakistan",
  "and the unseating of Jawaharlal Nehru \u2013 as they shouted, \u2018Pakistan tod do\u2019,",
  "\u2018Nehru Hakumat Chhod Do\u2019.",
  "The main speaker at these RSS-organized shows was usually Swami",
  "Karpatriji Maharaj. Addressing a meeting on 16 September 1951, the swami",
  "challenged the prime minister to a debate on the proposed bill. \u2018If Pandit",
  "Nehru and his colleagues succeed in establishing that even one section of the",
  "proposed Hindu Code is in accordance with the Shastras\u2019, said Karpatri, \u2018I",
  "shall accept the entire Hindu Code\u2019. The next day, in pursuance of this chal-",
  "lenge, the swami and his followers marched on Parliament. The police pre-",
  "vented them from entering. In the ensuing scuffle, reported a Hindu weekly,",
  "\u2018policepushedthemback[and]Swamiji\u2019sdanda[stick]wasbroken,whichis",
  "like the sacred thread, [the] religious emblem of the sannyasis\u2019.13",
  "Coincidentally, just two days before Swami Karpatriji\u2019s march, the pres-",
  "ident had written the prime minister along letter of protest against the bill. As",
  "in 1948 and 1949, now too Rajendra Prasad felt that the present Parliament,",
  "based like its predecessor on a restricted franchise, was \u2018not competent to en-",
  "act a measure of such a fundamental nature\u2019. The bill, argued the president,",
  "was\u2018highlydiscriminatory\u2019,foritappliedtoonlyonecommunity,theHindus.",
  "Either the same laws governing marriage and property should be applied to",
  "all Indians, or else the existing customary laws of the different communities",
  "should be left untouched. Prasad wrote ominously that \u2018he proposed to watch",
  "theprogressofthemeasureinParliamentfromdaytoday\u2019.Ifthebillwasstill",
  "passed, he would insist on his \u2018right to examine it on its merits. . . before giv-",
  "ing assent toit\u2019.14Nehru wrote back saying that in his view there was \u2018a very widespread",
  "expression of opinion in the country in favour of the Bill\u2019. But the president\u2019s",
  "opposition had him worried, for it presaged a possible stand-off between the",
  "governmentandtheheadofstate.HeshowedPrasad\u2019slettertoseveralexperts",
  "ontheconstitution.Theyassuredhimthatthepresidentwasboundtoactwith",
  "\u2018the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers and cannot act independently",
  "of that advice\u2019. As they saw it, the position of the president of India was even",
  "weaker than that of the British monarch.15",
  "Despite this advice, Nehru chose not to challenge the president. In any",
  "case, the progress of the bill in the provisional Parliament had been painfully",
  "slow. An immense number of objections and amendments had been tabled. It",
  "took the better part of a year to have a mere four clauses passed. In the end",
  "\u2018the session ended, the bill was virtually talked out, and it lapsed\u2019.16",
  "The man who was most hurt by this failure was the law minister. Dr",
  "Ambedkar had staked his reputation on the bill, meeting criticism and",
  "calumnywithequalresolution.ThatNehruhadfinallychosentogiveintothe",
  "opposition pained him deeply. In October 1951 he resigned from the Union",
  "Cabinet.HeintendedtoannouncehisdecisionintheHouse,butwhentheDe-",
  "puty Speaker asked for a copy of his speech beforehand, he walked out in a",
  "huff and released it to the press instead.",
  "Ambedkar gave several reasons for his decision to resign. He had been",
  "in poor health, for one. For another, the prime minister had failed to repose",
  "adequate trust in him. Despite having a PhD in economics (from the London",
  "SchoolofEconomics,noless)hehadbeenleftoutofdiscussionsonplanning",
  "and development. A third reason was his growing reservations about the gov-",
  "ernment\u2019s foreign policy, particularly with regard to Kashmir. A fourth reas-",
  "on was that the condition of his fellow Scheduled Castes continued to be",
  "wretched. Despite the coming of political independence, and a constitution",
  "protecting their rights, they faced the \u2018same old tyranny, the same old oppres-",
  "sion, the same old discrimination\u2019.",
  "Ambedkar came in the end to the issue which had finally provoked him",
  "to resign. He had, he said, set his cap on having the Hindu Code Bill passed",
  "beforetheendoftheParliament.Hehadtriedhardtoconvincetheprimemin-",
  "ister about the urgency of the matter. But Nehru did not give him the kind of",
  "support he had hoped for. Facing opposition within his own party, the prime",
  "minister, complained Ambedkar, had not \u2018the earnestness and determination\u2019",
  "required to overcome it.17IV",
  "In the first months of 1952 the recent debates on the Hindu Code Bill cast",
  "their shadow as India held its first general election. Feeling let down by the",
  "Congress, Dr Ambedkar had founded his own Scheduled Caste Federation in",
  "opposition to it. As for the prime minister, in his own constituency of Alla-",
  "habadhewasopposedbyaleaderofthenownotoriousAnti-Hindu-Code-Bill",
  "Committee.",
  "This was Prabhu Dutt Brahmachari. He was an ascetic and celibate, to",
  "signal which he wore saffron. Brahmachari\u2019s candidature was supported by",
  "the Jana Sangh, the Hindu Mahasabha and the Ram Rajya Parishad. His cam-",
  "paign was run on a single-item agenda \u2013 no tampering with Hindu tradition.",
  "He printed pamphlets detailing the prime minis attempts to interfere with that",
  "tradition, challenging him to an open debate on the subject.18",
  "Nehru sensibly refused. He won his seat with a massive margin, while",
  "the Congress got a comfortable majority overall. Nehru saw this, in part, as",
  "a mandate for his campaign against communalism. Soon after the Parliament",
  "was convened he resurrected the Hindu Code Bill.",
  "Keeping the earlier protests in mind, the original bill was now broken",
  "up into several parts. There were separate bills dealing with Hindu marriage",
  "and divorce, Hindu minority and guardianship, Hindu succession, and Hindu",
  "adoptions and maintenance. These component parts retained the rationale and",
  "driving force of the original unified proposal. The main thrust was to make",
  "caste irrelevant to Hindus with regard to marriage and adoption, to outlaw",
  "polygamy, to allow divorce and dissolution of marriage on certain specified",
  "grounds and to greatly increase a woman\u2019s share of her husband\u2019s and her",
  "father\u2019s property.19",
  "The prime minister was in the vanguard of the pro-reform movement,",
  "telling Parliament that \u2018real progress of the country means progress not only",
  "on the political plane, not only on the economic plane, but also on the social",
  "plane\u2019.TheBritishhadalliedthemselveswith\u2018themostconservativesections",
  "of the community they could find\u2019. The conjoining of tradition and colonial-",
  "ism meant that \u2018our laws, our customs fall heavily on the womenfolk\u2019. Thus",
  "\u2018differentstandardsofmoralityareappliedtomenandwomen\u2019.Menwereal-",
  "lowed more than one wife, but when a woman wished for a divorce she was",
  "challenged by men, only \u2018because men happen to be in a dominant position. I",
  "hope they will not continue in that dominant position for all time.\u2019Hindu customs and laws were hypocritical as well as unjust. Women",
  "were urged to model themselves on mythic figures of devotion and fidelity",
  "but, said Nehru, \u2018I do not seem to remember men being reminded in the same",
  "manner of Ramachandra and Satyavan, and urged to behave like them. It is",
  "only the women who have to behave like Sita and Savitri; the men may be-",
  "have as they like.\u201920",
  "Nehruworkedhardtoconvincehiscolleaguesoftheimportanceofthese",
  "measures. He wrote to one of his senior ministers, a Brahmin who tended to-",
  "wards the orthodox, that \u2018we have to remember that in the acknowledged so-",
  "cial code and practice of India, as it has existed thus far, there was no lack",
  "of moral delinquency as well as extreme unhappiness. There were two codes,",
  "one for the man and the other for the woman. The woman got the worst of it",
  "always.\u2019 To a young first-time MP Nehru wrote that \u2018we should concentrate",
  "on the passage through Parliament of the Marriage and Divorce Bills and the",
  "Succession Bill. These are the really important ones. The bills dealing with",
  "adoption and guardianship, etc. are relatively unimportant.\u201921",
  "By now the Anti-Hindu-Code-Bill Committee had lost its momentum.",
  "After the 1952 election the names of Swami Karpatriji Maharaj and Prabhu",
  "Dutt Brahamachari do not appear in the newspapers or police records. There",
  "were no longer any protests on the streets, but there were still criticisms",
  "aplenty in Parliament. The orthodox MPs saw the new bills as designed to",
  "destroyHinduculture.Forthem,thelawsofManuandYagnavalkyawereim-",
  "mutable and unchangeable, as relevant in 950 as in 1950.22",
  "BC AD",
  "But there was also an opposition that was less vulgar and more con-",
  "sidered; representing what we might call Hindu conservatives rather than",
  "Hindu reactionaries. Consider thus the views of the distinguished historian",
  "Radha Kumud Mookerji. He felt that the new proposals, particularly the pro-",
  "visions allowing divorce, were",
  "againsttheveryspiritofHinducivilization...TheBillisinspiredbythe",
  "westernviewoflifewhichattachesmorevaluetotheromanceofmarital",
  "relations and married life than to parenthood in which marriage attains",
  "itsfruition.TheHindusystemconceivesofparenthoodassomethingthat",
  "is permanent, unchangeable, and inviolable . . . The Bill seeks to change",
  "popular psychology as to the sanctity of marriage and family and loosen",
  "the ties of family as the very foundations of society. It thinks more of",
  "husbandandwifethanthefatherandmotherinwhomtheyaretobeper-",
  "manently merged to protect the child and the future of the race.23This argument did not go uncontested. A woman member felt that \u2018the effect",
  "of a broken home is less injurious than that of a disharmonious home. Chil-",
  "dren are of a very receptive mind and the scenes that they may see of neglect",
  "and quarrel between the parents . . . are bound to leave their mark. If \u2018the",
  "home has lost peace\u2019, remarked another member, there was no point \u2018forcing",
  "[husbandandwife]tolive together\u2019;itwasbetter toallow \u2018separation inare-",
  "spectable fashion\u2019.24",
  "In the Lok Sabha the opposition to the reforms was led by the brilliant",
  "Hindu Mahasabha lawyer N. C. Chatterjee. If this was indeed a secular state,",
  "argued Chatterjee, what was the need for a \u2018Hindu\u2019 Marriage and Divorce",
  "Act? Why not make the same law apply for all citizens? Thus, if the govern-",
  "menthonestlybelievedinthevirtuesofmonogamy,that\u2018thisisablessingand",
  "polygamy is a curse, then why not rescue our Muslim sisters from that curse",
  "andfromthatplight?\u2018Youhavenotthecourage\u2019,Chatterjeetoldthelawmin-",
  "ister, \u2018to be logical and to be consistent.\u201925",
  "The socialist J. B. Kripalani likewise felt that by prescribing monogamy",
  "only for the Hindus, the government was being hypocritical. \u2018You must bring",
  "it also for the Muslim community,\u2019 said Kripalani. \u2018Take it from me that the",
  "Muslim community is prepared to have it but you are not brave enough to do",
  "it.\u2019 But his own wife, the Congress MP Sucheta Kripalani, thought that the",
  "Muslimswerenotyetready.For\u2018weknowtherecentpasthistoryofourcoun-",
  "try. We know what trouble we have had over our minority problem. That is",
  "why I think the Government today is not prepared to bring one Uniform Civil",
  "Code. But I hope the day will soon come in the future when we shall be able",
  "to have one.\u201926",
  "Theelectionof1952hadreturnedtoParliamentanarrayofarticulateand",
  "confident women Congress MPs. These, naturally, saw the opposition to the",
  "legislation as the work of reactionaries. Subhadra Joshi, speaking in Hindi,",
  "launched abroad side against the custom of arranged marriages, which virtu-",
  "ally soldwomeninto sharmkizindagi,alife ofshame anddegradation. Shiv-",
  "rajvati Nehru noted that, while male politicians talked grandly of economic",
  "and political reform, they were not willing to make a single change in the",
  "sphere of social life and custom. In Hindu society the man was free and sov-",
  "ereign (purn swatantra); but the woman was bonded \u2013 to him. Even now, the",
  "husband was prone to treat his wife as a pair of slippers on his feet, to be dis-",
  "carded at will.27",
  "In support of the reforms were several Scheduled Caste members, who",
  "knewbetterthananyoneelsehowHindu\u2018custom\u2019maskedamultitudeofsins.",
  "One MP said that if the orthodox had their way, they wouldstart amending the Constitution so as to do away with all the mischief",
  "done by this Congress Government, and certain new fundamental rights",
  "will be added. The first of them will be that all Hindu women will have",
  "the wonderful and glorious right of burning themselves on the funer-",
  "al pyres of their husbands. The second fundamental right would be that",
  "the cow will be declared a divine being, . . . and all Indians, including",
  "Muslims, Christians and so on will be compelled to worship the cow.28",
  "Thecommunists,fortheirpart,thoughtthenewlawswerenotradicalenough.",
  "In the Lok Sabha, B. C. Das termed them \u2018a mild, moderate attempt at social",
  "reform with all the hesitancy and timidity characteristic of all social meas-",
  "ures sponsored by this Government\u2019. Still, those who opposed this \u2018moder-",

  "he passed away. His sometime colleague Jawaharlal Nehru spoke in tribute in",

  "NehruwasdeterminedtoeffectchangesinthelawsofhisfellowHindus,",
  "yet prepared to wait before dealing likewise with the Muslims. The aftermath",
  "of Partition had left the Muslims who remained in India vulnerable and con-",
  "fused. At this stage, to tamper with what they considered hallowed tradition \u2013",
  "the word of Allah himself \u2013 would make them even less secure. Thus, when",
  "he was asked in Parliament why he had not brought in a uniform civil code",
  "immediately, Nehru answered that, while such a code had his \u2018extreme sym-",
  "pathy\u2019, he did not think that \u2018at the present moment the time is ripe in India",
  "for me to try to push it through. I want to prepare the ground for it and this",
  "kind of thing is one method of preparing the ground.\u201939",
  "Others viewed this caution more cynically. As Dr Shyama Prasad",
  "Mookerjee pointed out in the provisional Parliament, \u2018it is nobody\u2019s case that",
  "monogamy is good for Hindus alone or for Buddhists alone or for Sikhs",
  "alone\u2019. Why not then have a separate bill prescribing monogamy for all cit-",
  "izens? Having asked the question, Dr Mookerjee supplied this answer: \u2018I am",
  "not going to tread on this question because I know the weaknesses of the pro-",
  "moters of the bill. They dare not touch the Muslim minority. There will be so",

  "As we have seen in Chapter 4, by 1949 Sheikh Abdullah was in firm con-",
  "troloftheadministration ofJammu andKashmir.Butthestatus oftheterritory",
  "was still under dispute. The United Nations had called for a plebiscite and was",
  "trying to get India and Pakistan to meet the conditions for holding it.",
  "In February 1950 the UN Security Council asked both countries to with-",
  "draw their armies from the state. As before, both sides stalled. India asked for",
  "the Pakistanis to take their troops out first while Pakistan demanded that the",
  "National Conference government be removed from office. India had begun to",
  "regret taking the matter to the United Nations in the first place. By 1950 it was",
  "quite prepared to hold on to its part of the disputed state, and let Pakistan take",
  "thehindmost.TheIndianConstitution,whichcameintoeffectinJanuary1950,",
  "treated Kashmir as part of the Indian Union. However, it guaranteed the state",
  "a certain autonomy; thus Article 370 specified that the president would consult",

  "and communications.1AsforPakistan,politicians thereheldthattheirclaimneedednocertific-",

  "Pakistan would remain incomplete until the whole of Kashmir has been liber-",
  "ated\u2019. Two weeks later, a serving prime minister observed that \u2018for Pakistan,",
  "Kashmir is a vital necessity; for India it is an imperialistic adventure\u2019.2",
  "On both sides of the border the governmental positions were echoed and",
  "amplified by the press. In the summer of 1950 the British broadcaster Lionel",

  "had many friends in both India and Pakistan. Visiting them and speaking also",
  "to their friends, he found that on either side of the international boundary \u2018the",
  "visitor is assailed by arguments and harangues to prove that the other country",
  "is not only wrong but diabolically wrong, and mischievously to boot\u2019. He ob-",
  "servedthat\u2018thetoneoftheIndianPresstendstobealittlepatronizing,sweetly",
  "reasonable but nevertheless obstinate, and rather consciously self-righteous\u2019.",
  "On the other hand, \u2018the tone of the Pakistan Press and Pakistan leaders tends",
  "to be resentful, arrogant and sometimes aggressive\u2019. Pakistani hostility was",
  "compounded by the fear that powerful forces in India wanted to reconquer or",
  "reabsorb their land in a united Akhand Bharat.",
  "Fielden summarized the respective points of view: \u2018In clinging to Kash-",
  "mir, India wants to weaken Partition; in claiming it, Pakistan wants to make",
  "Partition safe.\u2019 On the issue of Kashmir both sides were absolutely rigid.",
  "Thus, \u2018to fight to the last ditch for [Kashmir] is the slogan of all Pakistanis;",
  "not to give way on it is rapidly becoming the fixed idea in India.\u2019",
  "Fielden ended his analysis with a warning. In the long run, he pointed",
  "out, \u2018the most important thing\u2019 about the Kashmir conflict was \u2018the expense",
  "in armaments in which both countries are getting involved. This means that",
  "social services in both countries are crippled, and since both countries, apart",
  "fromtheirrefugees,havemillionsofthepoorestpeopleintheworld,itiseasy",
  "to see how this can lead to disaster.\u20193",
  "The United Nations had tried and failed to solve the dispute. Could an-",
  "other \u2018third party\u2019 succeed? In January 1951, at a meeting at 10 Downing",
  "Street, the Australian Prime Minister Sir Robert Menzies suggested that a",
  "plebiscitebeheldunderCommonwealthauspices.TheBritishprimeminister,",
  "Clement Attlee, appeared to favour the idea, but Nehru said any settlement",
  "must have the concurrence of the state government of Sheikh Abdullah. The",
  "Pakistani prime minister dismissed that government as \u2018puppets appointed by",
  "Nehru [whom] he could change any time\u2019. In reply, Nehru noted that \u2018the",
  "Pakistan press was full of this religious appeal and calls for Jehad. If this wasthe kind of thing that was going to take place during a plebiscite, then there",
  "would be no plebiscite but civil upheaval, not only in Kashmir, but elsewhere",

  "be of immense value in the struggle against communism?",
  "We still can\u2019t say, and it seems Abdullah was equally unsure at the time,",
  "for he now went back to the Indian government to negotiate with them the",
  "terms of Kashmir\u2019s autonomy. The state, it was decided, would have its own",
  "constituent assembly, where the terms by which it would associate with In-",
  "dia would be finalized. In January 1951 Abdullah wrote to the minister of",
  "statesthat,asheunderstoodit,theJammuandKashmirConstituentAssembly",
  "woulddiscuss\u2018thequestionofaccessionoftheState,thequestionofretention",
  "or abolition of the Ruler as the Constitutional Head of the State and the ques-",

  "would\u2018takedecisionsonallissuesspecifiedabove\u2019,decisionsthegovernment",
  "of India must treat as \u2018binding on all concerned\u2019. This suggested that even",
  "Kashmir\u2019s accession to India was not final. As an alarmed minister of states",
  "notedinthemarginsoftheletter,theSheikh\u2019sinterpretation was\u2018perhapsgo-",
  "ing beyond what we said\u2019.7",
  "TheSheikh,asever,presumedtospeakforthestateofJammuandKash-",
  "mir as a whole. In truth, while he was still revered in the Valley, he was be-",
  "coming quite unpopular among the Hindu of the Jammu region, who were",
  "keen to merge their part of the state with the Indian Union as quickly as pos-",
  "sible. In 1949 a Praja Parishad (Peoples\u2019 Party) was formed to represent the",
  "interestsoftheJammuHindus.Itwasledbyaseventy-year-oldveteran,PremNath Dogra. Characteristically, Sheikh Abdullah dismissed the opposition in",
  "Jammu as a bunch of \u2018reactionaries\u2019.8",
  "In October 1951 elections were held to the Kashmir Constituent",
  "Assembly.ThePrajaParishadhaddecidedtocontestbut,earlyon,thenomin-",
  "ation papers of several of their candidates were found to be invalid. In protest",
  "they chose to boycott the election. All seventy-five seats were won by Ab-",
  "dullah\u2019s National Conference. All but three of their candidates were returned",
  "unopposed.9",
  "Sheikh Abdullah\u2019s opening speech in the Constituent Assembly ran for",
  "a full ninety minutes. Reading from a printed English text, the Sheikh dis-",
  "cussed,onebyone,theoptionsbeforethepeopleofKashmir.Thefirstwasto",
  "join Pakistan, that \u2018landlord-ridden\u2019 and \u2018feudal\u2019 theocracy. The second was",
  "to join India, with whom the state had a \u2018kinship of ideals\u2019 and whose gov-",
  "ernment had \u2018never tried to interfere in our internal autonomy\u2019. Admittedly,",
  "\u2018certain tendencies have been asserting themselves in India which may in the",
  "future convert it into a religious State wherein the interests of the Muslims",
  "will be jeopardized\u2019. On the other hand, \u2018the continued accession of Kashmir",
  "to India\u2019 would promote harmony between Hindus and Muslims, and margin-",
  "alize the communalists. \u2018Gandhiji was not wrong\u2019, argued the Sheikh, \u2018when",
  "he uttered words before his death which [I] paraphrase: \u201cI lift up mine eyes",
  "unto the hills, from whence cometh my help\u201d.\u2019",
  "Abdullah came, finally, to \u2018the alternative of making ourselves an",
  "Eastern Switzerland, of keeping aloof from both States, but having friendly",
  "relationswiththem\u2019.Thiswasanattractiveoption,butitdidnotseempractic-",
  "al. How would a small, landlocked country safeguard its sovereignty? As the",
  "Sheikh reminded his audience, Kashmir had once been \u2018independent\u2019 of both",
  "India and Pakistan; between 15 August and 22 October 1947, when its inde-",
  "pendence had been destroyed by the tribal invasion. What was the guarantee",
  "that a sovereign Kashmir \u2018may not be victim of a similar aggression\u2019?10",
  "Thus, the Sheikh rejected the option of independence as impractical, and",
  "theoptionofjoiningPakistanasimmoral.TheywouldjoinIndia,butonterms",
  "of their own choosing. Among these terms were the retention of the state flag",
  "and the designation of the head of government as prime minister. Neither was",
  "acceptable to the Praja Parishad of Jammu. Asking for the complete integ-",
  "ration of Kashmir into India, they had adopted the slogan: \u2018Ek Vidhan, ek",
  "Pradhan, ek Nishan\u2019 (One Constitution, One Head of State, One Flag).",
  "In January 1952, shortly before Abdullah was due to speak in Jammu",
  "town, Hindu students protested against the National Conference flag being",
  "flown alongside the Indian tricolour. They were arrested and later expelledfromtheircollege.Thissparkedawaveofsympathyprotestsculminatingina",

  "their aged leader, Prem Nath Dogra, although he had not participated in the",

  "The government in Delhi, fearful of a countrywide Hindu backlash, per-",

  "agreed,ifreluctantly.On10Aprilhemadeaspeechinwhichhesaidhisparty",
  "would accept the Indian Constitution \u2018in its entirety once we are satisfied that",
  "the grave of communalism has been finally dug\u2019. He darkly added: \u2018Of that",
  "we are not sure yet. The Sheikh said that the Kashmiris \u2018fear what will hap-",
  "pen to them and their position if, for instance, something happens to Pandit",
  "Nehru\u2019.11",
  "Both the timing and venue of Abdullah\u2019s speech were significant. It",
  "was made in Ranbirsinghpura, a town only four miles from the border with",
  "Pakistan. And India had just come through a general election the result of",
  "which appeared to vindicate Jawaharlal Nehru and his policies. The speech",
  "was widely reported, and caused considerable alarm. Why was the man who",
  "hadoftenissuedchitscomplimentingIndiaforitssecularismsuddenlyturning",
  "so sceptical?",
  "The Sheikh\u2019s change of mind coincided with a visit to Kashmir by the",
  "veteran British journalist Ian Stephens. Stephens, who had been editor of the",
  "Calcutta Statesman during the troubles of 1946\u20137, was known to be a strong",
  "supporter of Pakistan. He thought that the Kashmir Valley, with its majority",
  "Muslim population, properly belonged to that country. Still, he was sensitive",
  "to the dilemmas of its leader. He had long talks with Abdullah, whom he saw",
  "as \u2018a man of pluck and enlightenment, standing for principles good in their",
  "way; a victim, like so many of us, of the unique scope and speed and confu-",
  "sion of the changes in 1947, and now holding a perhaps uniquely lonely and",
  "perplexing post\u2019. His was a regime upheld by \u2018Indian bayonets, which meant",
  "mainly Hindu bayonets\u2019. Admittedly, \u2018in many ways it was a good regime:",
  "energetic, full of ideas, staunchly non-communal, very go-ahead in agrarian",
  "reform\u2019. But, concluded Stephens, \u2018to the eye of history it might prove an un-",
  "natural one\u2019.12",
  "IIIOnce, Abdullah had been Nehru\u2019s man in Kashmir. By the summer of 1952,",
  "however, it was more that Nehru was Abdullah\u2019s man in India. The Sheikh",
  "had made it known that, in his view, only the prime minister stood between",
  "India and the ultimate victory of Hindu communalism.",
  "Meanwhile, discussions continued about the precise status of Kashmir",
  "vis-\u00e0-vistheIndianUnion.InJulytheSheikhmetNehruinDelhiandalsohad",
  "a round of meetings with other ministers. They hammered out a compromise",
  "known as the Delhi Agreement, whereby Kashmiris would become full cit-",
  "izens of India in exchange for an autonomy far greater than that enjoyed by",
  "other states of the Union. Thus the new state flag (devised by the National",
  "Conference) would for \u2018historical and other reasons\u2019 be flown alongside the",
  "national flag. Delhi could not send in forces to quell \u2018internal disturbances\u2019",
  "without the consent of Srinagar. Where with regard to other states residuary",
  "powersrestedwiththecentre,inthecaseofKashmirthesewouldremainwith",
  "the state. Crucially, those from outside the state were prohibited from buying",
  "land or property within it. This measure was aimed at forestalling attempts",
  "to change the demographic profile of the Valley through large-scale immigra-",
  "tion.13",
  "Theseweremajorconcessions,buttheSheikhpressedforgreaterpowers",

  "ness and sorrow of the common man\u2019. For \u2018if he is under the delusion that he",
  "can retain his office with the help of his few supporters, he is mistaken\u2019.14",
  "The \u2018reactionary elements\u2019 referred to here were the Hindus of Jammu.",
  "They had restarted their agitation, with an amended if equally catchy slogan:",
  "\u2018Ek Desh mein Do Vidhan, Do Pradhan, Do Nishan \u2013 nahin chalenge, nahin",
  "chalenge\u2019 (Two Constitutions, Two Heads of State, Two Flags \u2013 these in one",
  "State we shall not allow, not allow). Processions and marches, as well as",
  "clashes with police, became frequent. Once more the jails of Jammu began to",
  "fill with the volunteers of the Praja Parishad.",
  "The Hindus of Jammu retained a deep attachment to the ruling family,",
  "andtoMaharajaHariSinghinparticular.Theyresentedhisbeingdeposedand",
  "were displeased with his son for being \u2018disloyal\u2019 by agreeing to replace him.",
  "But their apprehensions were also economic-namely,that the land reforms re-",
  "cently undertaken in the Kashmir Valley would be reproduced in Jammu. Inthe Valley, zamindars had been dispossessed of land in excess of the ceiling",
  "limit. Since this was fixed at twenty-two acres per family, their losses were",
  "substantial. The land seized by the state had been vested chiefly in the hands",
  "ofthemiddlepeasantry.Theagricultural proletariat hadnotbenefited toquite",
  "the same extent. Still, the land reforms had gone further and been more suc-",
  "cessful than anywhere else in India.15",
  "As it happened, the large landlords in the Valley were almost all Hindu.",
  "This gave an unfortunate religious hue to what was essentially a project of",
  "socialist redistribution. This was perhaps inevitable; despite the sincerity of",
  "the Sheikh\u2019s secularist professions, they could not nullify the legacies of his-",
  "tory. At one time the state had been controlled by the Dogras of Jammu, who",
  "happened to be Hindu; now it was controlled by the National Conference,",
  "whichwasbasedintheValleyandwhoseleaderandmostofitsmemberswere",
  "Muslim.16",
  "IV",
  "Throughtheyears1950\u20132,astherestofIndiabecameacquaintedwithitsnew",
  "constitution and had its first elections, Jammu and Kashmir was beset by un-",
  "certainty on two fronts. There were the unsettled relations between the state",
  "and the Union, and there was the growing conflict between the Muslim-ma-",
  "jority Kashmir Valley and the Hindu-dominated Jammu region. Here was a",
  "situation made to order for a politician in search of a cause. And it found one",
  "in Dr Syama Prasad Mookerjee, who was to make the struggle of the Dogras",
  "of Jammu his own.",
  "Dr Mookerjee had left Jawaharlal Nehru\u2019s Cabinet to become the",
  "founder-president of the Bharatiya Jana Sangh. His new party fared poorly at",
  "thegeneralelectionof1952\u2013onlythreeofitsmemberswereelectedtoParlia-",
  "ment. The troubles in Kashmir came at an opportune time for Dr Mookerjee",
  "and the Jana Sangh. Here was a chance to lift the dispirited cadres, to forget",
  "the disappointments of the election and reinvent the party on the national",
  "stage.",
  "Dr Mookerjee began his charge with a series of blistering attacks on the",
  "government in Parliament. \u2018Who made Sheikh Abdullah the King of Kings",
  "in Kashmir?\u2019 he asked sarcastically. The Sheikh had apparently said that they",
  "wouldtreatboththeprovincialandnationalflags\u2018equally\u2019;this,saidtheJana",
  "Sangh leader, showed a \u2018divided loyalty\u2019 unacceptable in a sovereign coun-try. Even if the Valley wanted a limited accession, Jammu and the Buddhist",
  "region of Ladakh must be allowed to integrate fully if they so chose. But a",
  "better solution still would be to make the whole state a part of India, without",

  "Which, of course, is what Sheikh Abdullah was disposed to do. Through",
  "the winter of 1952/3 the Praja Parishad and the state government remained",
  "locked in conflict. Protesters would remove the state flag from government",

  "will be nothing short of national disgrace and humiliation if we fail to regain",
  "this lost portion of our own territory.\u2019",

  "wasmoreblunt;ashesawit,\u2018thePrajaParishadisdeterminedtoforceasolu-",

  "Mookerjee asked Nehru and Abdullah to release the Praja Parishad lead-",

  "again challenged Nehru to go to war with Pakistan: \u2018Please do not sidetrack",
  "theissueandletthepublicofIndiaknowhowandwhen,ifatall,wearegoing",
  "to get back this portion of our cherished territory.21",
  "Eventually the exchange ran a ground on a matter of pride. Nehru",
  "thought the Parishad should call off the movement as a precondition to talks",
  "with the government; Mookerjee wanted the government to offer talks as a",
  "precondition to the movement calling off the struggle. When the government",
  "refused to bend, Mookerjee decided to take the matter to the streets of Delhi.",
  "Beginning in the first week of March, Jana Sangh volunteers courted arrest",
  "in support of the demands of the Praja Parishad. The protesters would collect",
  "outside a police station and shout slogans against the government and against",
  "the prime minister, thereby violating Section 188 of the Indian Penal Code.",
  "The satyagraha was co-ordinated by Dr Mookerjee from his office in",
  "Parliament House. Participating were members of what the authorities were",
  "calling the \u2018Hindu communal parties\u2019: the Jana Sangh, the Hindu Mahasabha",
  "andtheRamRajyaParishad.BytheendofApril19531,300peoplehadbeen",
  "arrested. Intelligence reports suggest that they came from all parts of India,",
  "yet were overwhelmingly upper caste: Brahmins, Thakurs, Banias.22",
  "It was nowsummer,tourist season in the Valley.Among the first visitors",
  "to arrive, in late April, was the American politician Adlai Stevenson. He had",
  "come to Kashmir to sail on the Dal lake and see the snows, but also to meet",
  "Sheikh Abdullah. They met twice, for upwards of two hours each time. The",
  "content of these conversations were not revealed by either side, but some In-",
  "dians assumed it was all about independence. A Bombay journal otherwise",
  "known to be sympathetic to the United States claimed that Stevenson had",
  "assured Abdullah of much more than moral support. A loan of $15 million",
  "would be on hand once Kashmir became independent; besides, the US would",
  "ensure that \u2018the Valley would have a permanent population of at least 5,000American families, that every houseboat and hotel would be filled to capa-",
  "city,that Americans wouldbuyupall the art andcraft output ofthe dexterous",
  "Kashmiri artisans, that within three years every village in Kashmir would be",
  "electrified and so on and so forth\u2019.23",
  "Stevenson later denied that he had encouraged Abdullah. When the",
  "Sheikh offered the \u2018casual suggestion that independent status might be an al-",
  "ternativesolution\u2019,Stevensonstayedsilent;hedidnot,heclaimed,give\u2018even",
  "unconscious encouragement regarding independence, which did not seem to",
  "me realistic . . . I was listening, not talking\u2019.24",
  "So the Sheikh was once more contemplating independence. But inde-",
  "pendence for what? Not, most likely, the whole of the state of Jammu and",
  "Kashmir. One part (the north) was in Pakistani hands; another part (Jammu)",
  "was in the grip of a prolonged agitation. Abdullah\u2019s own papers are closed to",
  "scholars and he is silent on the subject in his memoirs, but we can plausibly",

  "V",
  "Not long after Stevenson, another politician came seeking to fish in troubled",
  "waters. On 8 May Dr Syama Prasad Mookerjee boarded a train to Jammu,",
  "en route to Srinagar. He had planned to take his satyagraha deep into enemy",
  "territory. Anticipating trouble, the state government issued orders prohibiting",
  "him from entering. Mookerjee disregarded the order and crossed the border",
  "on the morning of the 11th. The police requested him to return, and when he",
  "refused arrested him and took him to Srinagar jail.",
  "Before the Praja Parishad movement, Dr Mookerjee had been a lifelong",
  "constitutionalist. A Bengali bhadralok of the old school, he was comfortable",
  "inasuitandtie,sippingaglassofwhisky.Duringtheentirenationalistmove-",

  "had long held, in the words of his biographer, that \u2018legislatures were the only",
  "forum for giving vent to diverse viewpoints on Government policies\u2019. That",
  "belief sat oddly with Dr Mookerjee\u2019s support for the protests of the Praja Par-",
  "ishad. And now he was sanctioning and leading a street protest himself.Why then did Dr Mookerjee resort to methods with which he was un-",
  "familiar? He told his follower (and future biographer) Balraj Madhok that he",
  "was convinced that this was the only language the prime minister understood.",

  "taken lightly, for it had been in a similarly surcharged atmosphere that Ma-",

  "their old friendship and India\u2019s ties to Kashmir. He asked Abdullah to come",
  "down to Delhi and meet him. The Sheikh did not oblige. Then Nehru sent",
  "Maulana Abul Kalam Azad (the most senior member of the Cabinet) to Srin-",
  "agar, but that did not help either. The Sheikh now seemed convinced of two",

  "ernment of India, he said that \u2018a time will, therefore, come when I will bid",
  "them good-bye\u2019.33",
  "The Sheikh\u2019s turnabout greatly alarmed the prime minister. Writing to a",
  "colleague, Nehru said the developments in Kashmir were particularly unfor-",
  "tunate, for \u2018anything that happens there has larger and wider consequences\u2019.",
  "For the \u2018problem of Kashmir [was] symbolic of many things, including our",
  "secular policy in India\u2019.34",
  "By now the government of Kashmir was divided within itself, its mem-",
  "bers (as Nehru observed), liable \u2018to pull in different directions and proclaim",
  "entirely different policies\u2019. This was in good part the work of the government",
  "ofIndia\u2019sIntelligenceBureau.OfficersoftheBureauhadbeenworkingwith-",
  "in the National Conference, dividing the leadership and confusing the ranks.",
  "Some leaders, such as G. M. Sadiq, were left-wing anti-Americans; they dis-",
  "approved of the Sheikh\u2019s talks with Stevenson. Others, like Bakshi Ghulam",
  "Mohammed, had ambitions of ruling Kashmir themselves.35",
  "There was now an open rift within the National Conference between the",
  "pro-India and pro-independence groups. The latter were led by the Sheikh\u2019s",
  "close associate Mirza Afzal Beg. The former were in close touch with the",
  "sadr-i-riyasat, Karan Singh. It was rumoured that Sheikh Abdullah would de-",
  "clare independence on 21 August \u2013 the day of the great Id festival \u2013 follow-",
  "ing which he would seek the protection of the United Nations against \u2018Indian",
  "aggression\u2019.36 Two weeks before that date Abdullah dismissed a member of",
  "his Cabinet. This gave the others in the pro-India faction an excuse to move",
  "against him. Led by Bakshi Ghulam Mohammed, they wrote the Sheikh a let-",
  "ter accusing him of encouraging sectarianism and corruption. A copy of theletter was also sent to Karan Singh. He, in turn, dismissed Abdullah and in-",
  "vited Bakshi Ghulam Mohammed to form a government in his place.",
  "Abdullah was served his walking papers in the early hours of the morn-",
  "ing. When he was woken up and handed the letter of dismissal, the Sheikh",
  "flew into a rage. \u2018Who is the sadr-i-riyasat to dismiss me?\u2019, he shouted. \u2018I",
  "made that chit of a boy sadr-i-riyasat.\u2019 The police then told him that he had",
  "not just been dismissed, but also placed under arrest. He was given two hours",
  "to say his prayers and pack his belongings before being taken off to jail.",
  "Why was Abdullah humiliated so? Did he have to be dismissed in the",
  "deadofnight,anddidhethenhavetobeplacedunderdetention?KaranSingh",
  "later recalled that this was done because \u2018Bakshi Ghulam Mohammed made",
  "it quite clear that he could not undertake to run the Government if the Sheikh",
  "and Beg were left free to propagate their views\u2019. In other words, he was safe",
  "and quiet in jail, whereas as a free man, put out of office, he would quickly",
  "mobilize popular sentiment in hisfavour.37",
  "Then, and later, it was widely believed that the arrest of Abdullah was",
  "masterminded by Rafi Ahmad Kidwai. Kidwai was a left-leaning member of",
  "theCabinet, andaclose friendofNehru\u2019s.InDelhi itwasthoughtthat hisde-",
  "siretohumiliatetheSheikhhaditsrootsinthefactthatAbdullahwascurrying",
  "favour with the Americans. In Kashmir, however, it was held that this was a",
  "plain, if misguided, act of revenge. Back in 1947 Kidwai\u2019s brother had been",
  "murderedbyaKashmiriinthehillstationofMussoorie.DeposingtheSheikh",
  "was away of settling accounts.38",
  "Did Jawaharlal Nehru himself sanction the arrest of his friend Sheikh",
  "Abdullah? Nehru\u2019s biographer thinks he did not know beforehand, whereas",
  "hischiefofintelligence suggestshedid.Onethingisclear,however:oncethe",
  "deed was done he did nothing to countermand it.39",
  "Like his predecessor, the new prime minister of Kashmir was a larger-",
  "than-life figure. He was known commonly as the Bakshi, much as his pre-",
  "decessor was known as the Sheikh. Born in 1907 in modest circumstances,",
  "Ghulam Mohammed began his political career by organizing a union of car-",
  "riage drivers in Srinagar. That, and four terms in Hari Singh\u2019s jails, gave him",
  "sterling nationalist credentials. However, by temperament and orientation he",
  "wasquitedifferentfromtheSheikh.Onewasamanofideasandidealism,the",
  "other a man of action and organization. When the raiders attacked in Octo-",
  "ber 1947, it was Abdullah who gave the rousing speeches while the Bakshi",
  "placed volunteers in position and watched out for potential fifth-columnists.",
  "After 1947, while Abdullah dealt with Nehru and Delhi, the Bakshi \u2018kept the",
  "structure of the State intact, at a time when the whole Government had col-lapsedandwasnon-existent\u2019.AstwoKashmiriacademicswrotein1950,\u2018be-",

  "as he well understood, keeping Delhi on his side. Ten days after he had as-",

  "them that \u2018the ties between Kashmir and India are irrevocable. No power on",
  "earthcanseparatethetwo.Next,speakinginSrinagartoameetingofNational",
  "Conference workers, the Bakshi argued that \u2018Sheikh Abdullah played direc-",
  "tly into the hands of foreign invaders by entertaining the idea of an independ-",
  "ent Kashmir\u2019.That, he said, was \u2018a dangerous game, pregnant with disastrous",
  "consequencesforKashmir,India,andPakistan\u2019.SinceKashmirlackedthere-",
  "sources to defend itself, independence was a \u2018crack-brained idea\u2019, calculated",
  "only to make the state a centre of superpower intrigue. It was an idea \u2018which",
  "can devastate the people\u2019.41",
  "As prime minister, Bakshi Ghulam Mohammed adopted a populist style,",
  "holding a darbar (court) every Friday, where he heard the grievances of the",
  "public. An early move was to raise the procurement price of paddy. Next, he",
  "madeschooleducationfree,sanctionednewengineeringandmedicalcolleges",
  "and abolished customs barriers between Jammu and Kashmir and the rest of",
  "India.",
  "In October 1954 the All-India Newspaper Editors Conference was held",
  "in Srinagar. The state government pulled out all the stops, placing the guests",
  "in the best hotels and throwing parties at which the finest Kashmiri delicacies",
  "were served. A grateful editor wrote that, although the new regime had been",
  "in place only for a year, \u2018it can be safely said that the Bakshi Government has",
  "in some fields, brought in more reforms than did Sheikh Abdullah\u2019s in its six",
  "years of existence\u2019. After the public and the press it was the turn of the pres-",

  "Within and outside Kashmir the Bakshi was viewed as something of a",
  "usurper. Relevant here are the contents of two secret police reports on Friday",
  "prayers in Delhi\u2019s Jama Masjid. On 2 October 1953 the prayers were atten-",
  "ded by two members of Parliament from Kashmir. When they were asked by",
  "a Muslim cleric to organize a meeting on the situation in Kashmir, the MPs",
  "answeredthatthetimewasnotright,fortheywereworkingbehindthescenes",

  "report noted, \u2018the Muslims who had congregated there, including some Kash-",
  "miris, were talking against Bakshi Ghulam Mohammed in whispering tones.",
  "They said that he had become the Prime Minister of Kashmir after putting his",

  "VII",
  "In the 1950s, as in the 1940s, the Valley of Kashmir was troubled and un-",
  "settled. Behind the troubles of the 1940s lay the indecision of the Maharaja",
  "\u2013 who refused to accede to either Pakistan or India while there was still time",
  "\u2013 and the greed and fervour of the tribal raiders who invaded the state. Be-",
  "hind the troubles of the 1950s were the ambitions of Sheikh Abdullah and S.",
  "P. Mookerjee. Neither was willing to play within the rules of constitutional",
  "democracy. Both raised the political stakes and both, tragically, paid for it.",
  "The developments in Kashmir were worrisome not just to Indians. The",
  "British general who had been in charge of the Indian army in 1947 thought",

  "The developments of 1952\u20133 had raised sharp questions about India\u2019s",

  "ive since the mid nineteenth century, successfully converting several tribes to",
  "Christianity.",
  "At this time the Naga hills formed part of Assam, a province very diverse",
  "even by Indian standards, sharing borders with China, Burma and East",
  "Pakistan,dividedintouplandandlowlandregionsandinhabitedbyhundredsof",
  "different communities. In the plains lived Assamese-speaking Hindus, connec-",
  "ted by culture and faith to the greater Indian heartland. Among the important",
  "groups of tribes were the Mizos, the Khasis, the Garos, and the Jaintias, who",
  "took (or gave) their names to the mountain ranges in which they lived. Also in",
  "the region were two princely states, Tripura and Manipur, whose populations",
  "were likewise mixed, part Hindu and part tribal.",
  "Among the tribes of north-east India the Nagas were perhaps the most",
  "autonomous.TheirterritorylayontheIndo-Burmeseborder-indeed,therewere",
  "almost as many Nagas in Burma as in India. Some Nagas had contact withHindu villages in Assam, to whom they sold rice in exchange for salt. Yet the",
  "Nagas had been totally outside the fold of the Congress-led national move-",
  "ment. There had been no satyagraha here, no civil disobedience \u2013 in fact, not",
  "one Gandhian leader in a white cap had ever visited these hills. Some tribes",
  "had fiercely fought the British, but over time the two sides had come to view",
  "each other with mutual respect. For their part, the British affected a certain",
  "paternalism, wishing to \u2018protect their wards from the corrosive corruptions of",
  "the modern world.",
  "The Naga question really dates to 1946, the year the fate of British India",
  "was being decided in those high centres of imperial power, New Delhi and",
  "Simla. As elections were held across India, as the Cabinet Mission came and",
  "went, as the viceroy went into conclave with leaders of the Congress and the",
  "Muslim League, in their own obscure corner of the subcontinent some Na-",
  "gas began to worry about their future. In January 1946 a group who were",
  "\u2018educated Christians and spoke expressive English formed the Naga Nation-",
  "al Council, or NNC. This had the classic trappings of a nationalist movement",
  "in embryo: led by middle-class intellectuals, their ideas were promoted in a",
  "journal of their own, called The Naga Nation, 250 copies of which were mi-",
  "meographed and distributed through the Naga country.1",
  "The NNC stood for the unity of all Nagas, and for their \u2018self-determin-",
  "ation\u2019, a term which, here as elsewhere, was open to multiple and sometimes",
  "mutually contradictory meanings. The Angami Nagas, with their honourable",
  "martial tradition and record of fighting all outsiders (the British included),",
  "thoughtitshouldmeanafullyindependentstate:\u2018agovernmentoftheNagas,",
  "for the Nagas, by the Nagas\u2019. On the other hand, the Aos, who were more",
  "moderate, thought they could live with dignity within India, so long as their",
  "land and customs were protected and they had the autonomy to frame and en-",
  "force their own laws.",
  "The early meetings of the NNC witnessed a vigorous debate between",
  "these two factions which spilled over into the pages of the Naga Nation. A",
  "youngAngamiwrotethat\u2018theNagasareanationbecausewefeelourselvesto",

  "people to live with us.\u2019 An Ao doctor answered that the Nagas lacked the fin-",
  "ances, the personnel and the infrastructure to become a nation. \u2018At present\u2019,",

  "cial system, said Nehru, to save them from being \u2018swamped by people from",
  "otherparts ofthecountrywhomight gothere toexploit them totheir ownad-",

  "according to our own genius and taste. We shall enjoy home rule in our coun-",

  "The radicals, however, still stood out for complete independence. In this",
  "theywerehelpedbysomeBritishofficials,whowereloathtohavethesetribes",

  "of the north-east be constituted as a \u2018Crown colony\u2019, ruled directly from Lon-",
  "don, and not linked in anyway to the soon-to-be independent nation of India.3",
  "Others advised their wards that they should strike out for independence, as",
  "the state of India would soon break up anyway. As the Superintendent of the",
  "Lushai hills wrote in March 1947,",
  "My advice to the Lushais, since the very beginning of Lushai politics at",
  "theendoftheWar,hasbeenuntilveryrecentlynottotroublethemselves",
  "yet about the problem of their future relationship to the rest of India:",
  "nobody can possibly foretell what India will be like even two years from",

  "I would not encourage my small daughter to commit herself to vows of",
  "lifelongspinsterhood;butIwouldregarditasanevenworsecrimetobe-",
  "troth her in infancy to a boy who was himself still undeveloped.4",
  "In June1947 a delegation of the NNC met the governor of Assam, Sir Akbar",
  "Hydari, to discuss the terms by which the Nagas could join India. The two",
  "sides agreed that tribal land would not be alienated to outsiders, that Naga re-",
  "ligious practices would not be affected and that the NNC would have a say",
  "in the staffing of government offices. Next, an NNC delegation went to Del-",
  "hi, where they met Nehru, who once more told them that they could have",
  "autonomy but not independence. They also called on Mahatma Gandhi, in a",
  "meeting of which many versions have circulated down the years. In one ver-",
  "sion,GandhitoldtheNagasthattheycoulddeclaretheirindependenceifthey",
  "wished; that no one could compel them to join India; and that if New Delhi",
  "sent in the army, Gandhi himself would come to the Naga hills to resist it. He",
  "apparently said, \u2018I will ask them to shoot me first before one Naga is shot.\u20195The version printed in the Collected Works of Mahatma Gandhi is less dra-",
  "matic;here,Gandhiisreportedassaying,\u2018Personally,Ibelieveyouallbelong",
  "to me, to India. But if you say you don\u2019t, no one can force you.\u2019 The Ma-",

  "\u2018Learn all the handicrafts\u2019, said the Mahatma, \u2018that\u2019s the way to peaceful in-",
  "dependence. If you use rifles and guns and tanks, it is a foolish thing.\u20196",
  "The most vocal spokesmen for independence were the Angamis from",
  "Khonomah, a village which, back in 1879\u201380, had fought the British army",
  "to a standstill and whose residents were \u2018known and feared\u2019 across the Naga",
  "hills.7 A faction styling itself the Peoples\u2019 Independence League was putting",
  "up posters calling for complete independence, in terms borrowed (with ac-",
  "knowledgement) from American freedom fighters: \u2018It is my living sentiment,",
  "and by the blessing of God it shall be my dying sentiment \u2013 Independence",
  "nowandIndependenceforever\u2019(JohnAdams);\u2018Thisnation,underGod,shall",
  "have a new birth of freedom\u2019 (Abraham Lincoln); \u2018Give me liberty, or give",
  "me death!\u2019 (Patrick Henry).8",
  "Meanwhile,theBritishRajdepartedfromNewDelhiandthenewIndian",
  "state began to consolidate itself. The secretary to the governor of Assam told",
  "the Nagas that they were too few to successfully rebel against a nation of 300",

  "The parable did not go down well with the educated Nagas. \u2018Bones,",
  "bones,\u2019 remarked one angry NNC member. \u2018Does he think that we are dogs?\u2019",
  "However, the same warning was issued in more palatable form by Charles",
  "Pawsey, the departing deputy commissioner and an official whom the Nagas",
  "both loved and admired. Also writing in the Naga Nation, Pawsey underlined",

  "IIAs the Naga intelligentsia was struggling to define its \u2018independence\u2019, the",
  "Constituent Assembly of India was meeting in New Delhi. Among the topics",
  "for discussion was the place of tribals in a free and democratic India. On 30",
  "July 1947 Jaipal Singh informed the Assembly of \u2018some very unhappy devel-",
  "opments\u2019 which were brewing in the Naga hills. Jaipal had been receiving \u2018a",
  "telegram per day\u2019, the \u2018latest telegram becoming more confounded than the",
  "previous one. Each one seems to go one step further into the wilderness.\u2019 As",
  "he saw it, the Nagas had been \u2018misguided\u2019 into the belief that their status was",
  "akin to that of the princes, and that like them they could reclaim their sov-",
  "ereignty once the British left. When the Naga delegation had come to Delhi",
  "to meet Nehru and Gandhi, they had also met Jaipal, who apprised them of",
  "the \u2018blunt fact that \u2018the Naga Hills have always been part of India. Therefore,",
  "there is no question of secession.\u201910",
  "Jaipal Singh was, of course, a tribal himself, one of several million such",
  "whose homes lay in the hilly and forest belt that ran right across the heart of",
  "peninsularIndia.Knownas\u2018adivasis\u2019(originalinhabitants),thecentralIndian",
  "tribals were somewhat different from those that dwelt in the north-east. Like",
  "them, they were chiefly subsistence agriculturists who depended heavily on",
  "the forests for sustenance. Like them, they had no caste system and were or-",
  "ganized in clans; like them, they manifested far less gender inequality than in",
  "supposedly more \u2018advanced parts of the country. However, unlike the Nagas",
  "and their neighbours, the tribes of central India had long-standing relations",
  "with Hindu peasant society. They exchanged goods and services, sometimes",
  "worshipped the same Gods and had historically been part of the same king-",
  "doms.",
  "These relations had not been uncontentious. With British rule, the areas",
  "inhabited by tribes had been opened up to commercialization and coloniza-",
  "tion. The forests they lived in suddenly acquired a market value; so did the",
  "rivers that ran through them and the minerals that lay beneath them. Some",
  "parts remained untouched, but elsewhere the tribals were deprived of access",
  "to forests, dispossessed of their lands and placed in debt to money lenders.",
  "The \u2018outsider\u2019 was increasingly seen as one who was seeking to usurp the re-",
  "sources of the adivasis. In the Chotanagpur plateau, for example, the non-tri-",
  "bal was known as diku, a term that evoked fear as well as resentment.11",
  "The Constituent Assembly recognized this vulnerability, and spent days",
  "debating what to do about it. Ultimately, it decided to designate some 400",
  "communities as \u2018scheduled tribes\u2019. These constituted about 7 per cent of the",
  "population,andhadseatsreservedfortheminthelegislatureaswellasingov-",
  "ernment departments. Schedule V of the constitution pertained to the tribesthat lived in central India; it allowed for the creation of tribal advisory coun-",
  "cils and for curbs on moneylending and on the sale of tribal land to outsiders.",
  "Schedule VI pertained to the tribes of the north-east; it gestured further in the",
  "direction of local autonomy, constituting district and regional councils, pro-",
  "tecting local rights in land, forests and waterways and instructing state gov-",
  "ernments to share mining revenues with the local council, a concession not",
  "granted anywhere else in India.",
  "Jaipal Singh thought that these provisions would have real teeth only if",
  "thetribalscouldcometoforgeaseparatestatewithintheUnion.Hecalledthis",
  "putativestateJharkhand;inhisvisionitwouldincorporatehisownChotanag-",
  "pur plateau, then in Bihar, along with contiguous tribal areas located in the",
  "provinces of Bengal and Orissa. The proposed state would cover an area of",
  "some 48,000 square miles and have a population of 12 million people.12 The",
  "idea caught the imagination of the youth of Chotanagpur. Thus, in May 1947,",
  "the Adivasi Sabha of Jamshedpur wrote to Nehru, Gandhi and the Constitu-",
  "ent Assembly urging the creation of a Jharkhand state out of Bihar. \u2018We want",
  "Jharkhand Province to preserve and develop Adivasi Culture and Language\u2019,",
  "said their memorandum, \u2018to make our customary law supreme, to make our",
  "lands inalienable, and above all to save ourselves from continuous exploita-",
  "tion.\u201913",
  "In February 1948 Jaipal Singh delivered the presidential address to the",
  "All-India Adivasi Mahasabha, an organization that he had led since its incep-",
  "tion a decade previously. He spoke here of how, after Independence, \u2018Bihari",
  "imperialism\u2019 had replaced \u2018British imperialism\u2019 as the greatest problem for",
  "the adivasi. He identified the land question as the most crucial, and urged the",
  "speedy creation of a Jharkhand state. Notably, he simultaneously underlined",
  "hiscommitmenttotheIndianUnionbyspeakingwithfeelingaboutthe\u2018tragic",
  "assassination of Gan-dhiji\u2019, and by raising a slogan that combined local pride",
  "with a wider Indian patriotism: \u2018Jai Jharkhand! Jai Adivasi! Jai Hind!\u201914",

  "cess beyond its own imaginings, winning three seats to Parliament and thirty-",
  "three to the state\u2019s Assembly. These victories all came in the tribal regions of",
  "Bihar, where it comprehensively trounced the ruling Congress Party. At the",
  "polls at any rate, the case for Jharkhand had been proved.III",
  "Jaipal Singh and his Jharkhand Party offered one prospective path for the tri-",
  "bals: autonomy within the Indian Union, safeguarded by laws protecting their",
  "landandcustomsandbythecreationofaprovinceinregionswherethetribals",
  "were in a majority. The Naga radicals offered another: an independent, sov-",
  "ereign state carved out of India and quite distinct from it. Among the Nagas",
  "this view was upheld most insistently by the Angamis and, among them, by a",
  "certainresidentofKhonomahvillage,yetanotherofthoseremarkablemakers",
  "of Indian history who is still to find his biographer.",
  "The man in question was Angami Zapu Phizo, with whose name the",
  "Naga cause was to be identified for close to half a century. Born in 1913,",
  "Phizo was fair and slightly built, his face horribly twisted following a child-",
  "hood paralytic attack. Educated by the Baptists, and a poet of sorts \u2013 among",
  "his compositions was a \u2018Naga National Anthem\u2019 \u2013 he sold insurance for a",

  "delegation that met Mahatma Gandhi in New Delhi in July 1947. Three years",
  "later he was elected president of the NNC and committed the Nagas to \u2018full",
  "Independence\u2019. He quelled the doubters and nay-sayers, who wanted an ac-",
  "commodation with India. Many young Nagas were willing to go all the way",
  "with Phizo. Travelling in the area in December 1950, the Quaker Horace Al-",
  "exander met two NNC members whose \u2018minds are obsessed with the word",
  "\u201cindependence\u201d, and I do not believe that any amount of argument or appeals",
  "to the [Indian] constitution, still less any threat, will shake them out of it\u2019.16",

  "cises in totalitarian states, where, for example, 99.99 per cent of the Russian",
  "people are said to have endorsed Stalin as Supreme Leader. Still, there is nodoubt that Phizo himself wanted independence, and so did numerous of his",
  "followers.",

  "the wheels of history\u2019. He told them that \u2018the Nagas were as free as any In-",
  "dian\u2019, and under the constitution they had \u2018a very large degree of autonomy",
  "in managing their own affairs\u2019. He invited Phizo and his men to \u2018submit pro-",

  "said, \u2018we will continue our struggle for independence, and one day we shall",
  "meet [Nehru] again for a friendly settlement\u2019 (as representatives of a separate",
  "nation). The free state he had in mind would bring together 200,000 Nagas in",
  "India, another 200,000 in what he called \u2018no-man\u2019s land\u2019, and 400,000 who",
  "were presently citizens of Burma.19",
  "Afterwards the Jharkhand leader Jaipal Singh hosted a lunch for Phizo",

  "The extremists gained control of the NNC; petitions and demonstrations were",
  "abandoned, and preparations made for an armed uprising. The rebels began",
  "transporting weapons to a safe haven in the Tuensang area. In June 1954 the",
  "Assam Rifles attacked a village believed to be sympathetic to the guerrillas.",
  "In September some rebels declared the formation of a \u2018federal government of",
  "Nagaland\u2019.",
  "By now killings and counter-killings were occurring with fair regularity.",
  "There were villages loyal to the government which were targeted by the",
  "rebels; villages sympathetic to the freedom struggle which were attacked by",
  "theauthorities. AdivisionoftheIndianarmywascalled intoquelltherevolt,",

  "Naga leader returned to the jungle. However, one of his key aides, T. Sakhrie,",
  "had come round to the view that the Nagas could not ever hope to defeat the",
  "Indian army. Having made their point, the NNC guerrillas should lay down",
  "their weapons and their leaders seek an honourable settlement with the gov-",
  "ernment in New Delhi.",
  "Phizo, on the other hand, had pledged himself to a \u2018war that would not",
  "admitoftruces,retreatsorcompromises\u2019.Thesuggestionthathenegotiateof-",
  "fended him greatly; not least because Sakhrie was, like him, an Angami from",
  "Khonomah, indeed from the same khel or clan of Merhuma. \u2018Phizo was ab-",
  "solutely furious with Sakhrie\u2019s softening posture\u2019, which came when many",
  "young men were flocking to the rebel cause, with the guerrilla army at an all-",

  "no chance against the mighty Indian nation. He began touring the villages,",
  "preaching against Phizo\u2019s extremism and warning that violence would only",
  "beget more violence.29",
  "In January 1956 T. Sakhrie was dragged out of bed, taken to the jungle,",
  "tortured,thenkilled.ItwaswidelybelievedthatPhizohadorderedthemurder,although he denied it. In any event, the message had gone home \u2013 this is how",
  "betrayers to the cause would be treated. In March afresh announcement of a",
  "federal government of Nagaland was made. A national flag was designed and",
  "commanders appointed for the different regions of the designated homeland.",
  "Then, in July, occurred a killing that hurt India\u2019s image as much as Sakhrie\u2019s",
  "murder had hurt the NNC. A group of soldiers, having just beaten off a rebel",
  "ambush, were returning to Kohima. The town was under curfew; no one was",
  "supposedtobeoutonthestreets.Catchingsightofasolitaryoldman,thesol-",
  "diers ordered him off the road. When the man protested the jawans beat him",
  "with rifle-butts and finally pushed him off a cliff.",
  "The walker that the soldiers had so callously killed was a doctor named",
  "T. Haralu. He was, in fact, the first allopathic practitioner in the Naga hills",
  "and,assuch,knownandreveredinandaroundKohima.Hiskillingdissipated",
  "any propaganda advantage the Indians might have received from Sakhrie\u2019s",
  "murder. For if that death had \u2018intensified defections from [the NNC] to New",
  "Delhi, exactly the reverse happened by the killing of Dr Haralu\u2019.30",
  "Meanwhile, the army presence had increased considerably. The newly",
  "named Naga Hills Force consisted of one regiment of mountain artillery, sev-",
  "enteen battalions of infantry and fifty platoons of Assam Rifles. The rebels",
  "also had their own military structure \u2013 headed by a commander-in-chief (a",
  "brilliantstrategistnamedKaito)withfourcommandersunderhim,theirtroops",
  "grouped into battalions and companies. The Nagas were equipped with Brit-",
  "ish and Japanese rifles, and with Sten guns and machine guns, all part of",
  "the massive debris left behind after the Second World War. The rebels also",
  "used locally made muzzle-loaders and, in hand-to-hand combat, the tradition-",
  "al Naga sword or dao.",
  "To add to the regular Naga forces there were highly effective bands of",
  "irregulars,dividedinto\u2018volunteerparties\u2019,\u2018courierparties\u2019and\u2018women\u2019svo-",
  "lunteer organizations\u2019. The last-named were nurses who could, when called",
  "upon, fight very well indeed. And there was also the silent support of the",
  "ordinary villager. As part of their counter-insurgency operations, the Indian",
  "army brought isolated hamlets together in \u2018grouped villages\u2019; the residents",
  "hadtosleephereatnight,goingoutinthemorningtoworkinthefields.Inten-",
  "ded to break the chain of information from peasant to rebel, this tactic merely",
  "increased the army\u2019s unpopularity among the Nagas.31",
  "By the middle of 1956 a full-scale war was on in the Naga hills. In a",
  "statement to Parliament in the last week of July, the home minister, Govind",
  "BallabhPant,admittedthattheIndianarmyhadlost68menwhilekilling370",
  "\u2018hostiles\u2019. Pant accused Phizo of murdering Sakhrie \u2013 whom he called the\u2018leader of the sensible and patriotic group\u2019 \u2013 and of \u2018leading them [the Na-",

  "TheIndian(andinternational)presswasnotcoveringtheconflict,butwe",
  "can get a sense of its scale from letters written by a Naga doctor to the last",
  "British deputy commissioner of the Naga hills, Charles Pawsey. A letter of",
  "June1956describesatourintheinteriorwhere\u2018everynightwelookedupand",
  "saw villages burning in the hills \u2013 set alight by either the rebels or the army,",
  "no one knows.\u2019 As for the rebel leader,",
  "Phizo is being absolutely horrible to any Naga Government servant he",
  "catches, and even more so to any Naga who was on his council and",
  "has left him, as many have, because of his extreme methods . . . Many",
  "dobashis [headmen] have vanished and no one knows whether they are",
  "in hiding or Phizo\u2019s got them. Of course, their position is very difficult,",
  "for if they go about Government business Phizo gets them, and if they",
  "don t, the Government gets them.",
  "Two months later, the Naga doctor wrote to Pawsey that",
  "As I see it, .5 per cent of the Nagas are with Phizo; 1 per cent are more",
  "moderate, and want to break away from Assam and come under Delhi,",
  "and 98.5 per cent just want to be left alone\u2019 . . . Of course the way the",
  "army has behaved and is behaving means that now voluntary co-opera-",
  "tion between the Nagas and any Government is beyond hope.",
  "The methods of the army, he added, were such that they \u2018will affect Naga/In-",
  "dian relations for the next 50\u2013100 years\u2019.33",
  "In August 1956 there was an extended debate in the Lok Sabha on the",
  "situation in the Naga hills. A Meitei member from Manipur recounted how,",
  "onarecentvisittotheregion,theconvoyofvehicles hewastravelling inwas",
  "attacked by the rebels. Based on his enquiries, it appeared that \u2018it is very dif-",
  "ficulttobringthemroundtoourwayofthinkingandwaysoflife;moreespe-",
  "cially, Phizo is a hard nut to crack\u2019. He agreed that the Nagas could not \u2018have",
  "separate independence\u2019, yet thought that they should immediately be granted",
  "a separate state within the Indian Union.The next speaker was the Socialist MP Rishang Keishing, who mounted",
  "a fierce attack on the army for burning villages and killing innocent people",
  "(KeishingwashimselfaThangkulNagafromManipur).\u2018Thearmymenhave",
  "shown an utter disregard for the sentiments of the local Nagas, for, they have",
  "triedtoterrifythembycarryingthenakedcorpsesoftheNagaskilledbythem.",
  "When Phizo had met Nehru in 1951 and 1952, said Keishing, \u2018the parties did",
  "not try to understand each other\u2019s mind and the atmosphere was soon viti-",
  "ated and tempers lost\u2019. He wished \u2018that the prime minister had displayed here",
  "the same amount of patience and psychological insight for which he is fam-",
  "ous in the field of international diplomacy\u2019. In the years since, brutal meth-",
  "ods had been used by both sides. \u2018Who can boast of an untarnished record?\u2019",
  "askedKeishing.\u2018Whocandareflingthefirststoneandassertthattheyarenot",

  "commended\u2018animmediatedeclarationofgeneralamnesty\u2019,thesendingofan",

  "Phizo\u2019smentoagree toatruce, \u2018because thecontinuation ofhostilities means",
  "the ruins of innocent citizens\u2019.",
  "The prime minister, in reply, admitted that there had been some killings",
  "\u2013 including that of Dr Haralu, \u2018which has distressed us exceedingly\u2019 \u2013 but",
  "claimed \u2018that by far the greater part of the burning is done by the Naga hos-",
  "tiles\u2019. He argued that the government was seeking the co-operation ofthe Na-",
  "gasandthat,ashehadseveraltimestoldPhizo,NewDelhiwasalwayswilling",
  "to consider suggestions to improve the working of the Sixth Schedule, which",
  "allowed tribal areas great autonomy in the management of their land and re-",

  "parliamentarians to the Naga hills. And he insisted that \u2018it is no good talking",
  "to me about independence [for the Nagas] . . . I consider it fantastic for that",
  "little cornerbetween ChinaandBurmaandIndia\u2013apartofitisinBurma\u2013to",

  "In December 1956 a publication issued by the Indian High Commission",
  "in London reported the \u2018success\u2019 of army operations in the Naga hills. It",
  "claimed that the military had broken the back of the rebel resistance and was",
  "now \u2018engaged in mopping-up operations\u2019. The news appears to have been",
  "swallowed whole, for weeks later the Manchester Guardian ran an item with",
  "theheadline:\u2018NagaRebellionVirtuallyOver\u2019.TheIndiangovernment,itsaid,",
  "was taking steps \u2018to arrive at some understanding with the Naga moderates,",
  "whose ranks are swelling steadily\u2019. There was, however, no evidence of any",
  "independent confirmation of this new dawn said to be emerging.35V",
  "Through the 1950s the Jharkhand movement carried on its campaign for a",
  "provincewithinIndiarunforandbyadivasis.WhentheStatesReorganization",
  "Commission visited the area in January 1955, they were met everywhere by",
  "processionists shouting \u2018Jharkhand alag prant!\u2019 (Jharkhand must be a separ-",
  "ate state). As one participant in the protests recalled, the \u2018Jharkhand demand",
  "was writ large on every Adivasi face\u2019.36",
  "Across the country, in Manipur, a struggle was afoot to have that former",
  "chiefdom declared a full-fledged state of the Indian Union. Back in 1949 a",
  "popular movement had forced the Maharaja to convene an assembly elected",
  "onthebasisofuniversaladultfranchise.Buttheassemblywasdissolvedwhen",
  "ManipurmergedwithIndia.Theterritorywasnowdesignateda\u2018PartC\u2019state,",
  "which meant that it had no popularly elected body and was ruled by a chief",
  "commissioner responsible directly to Delhi.",
  "Manipur covered an area of 8,600 square miles. There was a mere 700",
  "square miles of valley, inhabited by 380,000 Meiteis owing allegiance to",
  "the Vaishnava traditions of Hinduism. The larger, hilly section was home to",
  "180,000 Naga and Kuki tribals. It was one such tribal, the aforementioned",
  "Rishang Keishing, whoin1954beganamovement forrepresentative govern-",
  "ment in Manipur. Keishing and his fellow socialists daily picketed the office",
  "of the chief commissioner in Imphal. Thousands of satyagrahis courted ar-",
  "rest, many of them women. But the government would not yield. Speaking in",
  "Parliament, the home minister said that the time was not ripe for the creation",
  "of legislative assemblies in Part C states such as Manipur and Tripura. \u2018These",
  "states\u2019, he said, \u2018are strategically situated on the borders of India. The people",
  "are still comparatively politically backward and the administrative machinery",
  "in these States is still weak.\u201937",
  "One does not know whether the Naga National Council took cognizance",
  "of the struggles for Jharkhand and Manipur, and of New Delhi\u2019s reluctance",
  "to give in to them. In any case, Phizo and his men were holding out for",
  "something much more ambitious \u2013 not just a province within India, but a na-",
  "tion outside it. The demand might have been \u2018absurd\u2019, yet it inspired numer-",
  "ous Nagas to abandon their villages and join the guerrillas.",
  "Atthistime,themid-1950s,therewereroughly200,000Nagasinthedis-",
  "trict that bore their name. There were alike number in the adjoining districts",
  "of NEFA, with another 80,000 in Manipur. Half a million Nagas in all, with",
  "perhaps just 10,000 of them participating full time in the struggle. However,weakness in numbers was amply compensated by strength of will. A small",
  "community of rebels had forced the Indian state to send in large contingents",
  "of military to suppress it.",
  "FewIndiansoutsidethenorth-eastknewoftheNagaconflictatthetime,",
  "and virtually no foreigners. Yet the conflict had serious implications for the",
  "unity of the nation, for the survival of its democracy and for the legitimacy of",
  "itsgovernment.Fornowhereelseinthecountry,noteveninKashmir,hadthe",
  "army been sent in to quell a rebellion launched by those who were formally",
  "citizens of the Indian state.",
  "In its first decade, this state had faced problems aplenty \u2013 among them",
  "oppositional movements based on class, religion, language and region. These",
  "had been handled by reason and dialogue or, in very rare instances, by the",
  "use of regular police. The conflict in the Naga hills, on the other hand, would",
  "not admit of such resolution. There was a fundamental incommensurability",
  "betweenwhattheNNCwasdemandingandwhatthegovernmentofIndiawas",
  "willing to give them. This was an argument which, it seemed, could be ended",
  "only by one party prevailing, militarily, over the other.",
  "Jawaharlal Nehru keenly understood the uniqueness of the Naga situ-",
  "ation.WritingtohisCabinetcolleaguesinMarch1955,healertedthemto\u2018the",
  "rather difficult problem in our tribal areas of the North East . . . [where] we",
  "have not succeeded in winning the people of these areas. In fact, they have",
  "been drifting away. In the Naga Hills district, they have non-cooperated for",
  "thelastthreeandahalfyearsanddonesowithgreatdisciplineandsuccess.38",
  "A year later, Nehru wrote to the chief minister of Assam that while the",
  "army would be deployed so long as the rebels had arms and were willing to",
  "use them, \u2018there is something much more to it than merely the military ap-",
  "proach\u2019. While \u2018there can be no doubt that an armed revolt has to be met by",
  "force\u2019, said Nehru, \u2018our whole past and present outlook is based on force by",
  "itself being no remedy. We have repeated this in regard to the greater prob-",
  "lems of the world. Much more must we remember this when dealing with our",
  "own countrymen who have to be won over and not merely suppressed.\u201939",

  "Otherwise, Nehru\u2019s regime seemed secure and stable. It had been democrat-",
  "ically elected, with a comfortable majority, while behind its foreign and do-",
  "mestic policies rested a wide national consensus. Soon, however, other chal-",

  "ing known to some as the \u2018Sepoy Mutiny\u2019 and to others as the \u2018First War of",
  "Indian Independence\u2019.",
  "Like 1757 and 1857, 1957 was also a year of momentous importance in",
  "the history of modern India. For it was in that year that India held its second",
  "generalelection.AftertheendoftheSecondWorldWar,dozensofAfricanand",
  "Asian nations won freedom from their European colonizers. From their incep-",
  "tion, or very soon afterwards, most of these new nations became autocracies",
  "ruledbycommunists,themilitaryorunaffiliateddictators.Indiawasoneofthe",
  "very few exceptions and, because of its size and social complexity, the really",
  "remarkable one. Before and after the great gamble of 1952 a series of provin-",
  "cial elections were held, in which the verdict of the ballot was honoured. Still,",
  "for India to certifiably join the league of democracies there had to be a second",
  "general election to follow the first. This was held over a period of three weeks",
  "in the spring of 1957.",
  "Sukumar Sen still served as chief election commissioner. Though fortuit-",
  "ous, the continuity was important, because the man who had designed the sys-tems couldtest afreshhowwell theyworked.Theevidence suggests that they",

  "In all, 193 million Indians were registered to vote; of which slightly",
  "less than half actually did. The ballots they marked collectively consumed",
  "197 tonnes of paper. Keeping them in line were 273,762 policemen, aided by",
  "168,281 village chowkidars (watchmen).",

  "II",
  "As in 1952, the 1957 election was in essence a referendum on the prime min-",
  "ister and his ruling party. Nehru was, again, the chief ideologue, propagand-",
  "ist and vote-catcher for the Congress. Helping him behind the scenes was his",
  "only child, Indira Gandhi. Estranged from her husband Feroze, she and her",
  "two sons stayed with her widowed father in his spacious official residence,",
  "Teen Murti House.2 Mrs Gandhi was often the last person the prime minister",
  "saw in the evening and the first he saw in the morning. Serving as his officialhostess,shemetandmixedwiththehighofthislandandofmanyothers.Her",
  "health, previously frail, had noticeably improved. Contemporary photographs",
  "show her once sickly frame to have filled out; the improvement obvious not",
  "just in her appearance, but in her manner as well. A recent biographer has",
  "linked this improvement to the new antibiotic drugs then entering the market,",
  "which cured the tuberculosis shewas thought to suffer from. 3",
  "WhatweknowofMrsGandhi\u2019smedicalconditionisbasedonintelligent",

  "were not restricted to her own gender; she presided over meetings held in",
  "Bombay to hasten the liberation of Goa from Portuguese rule.",
  "To those who knew her in her pre-political days, Indira Gandhi some-",

  "getic participation in the election campaign of 1957:",
  "When voting finished today, large numbers of our Congress workers",
  "turned up at Anand Bhawan, including many women. Indu has specially",

  "cialists on the left. Both those parties were now in disarray, caused in part",
  "by the departure of their charismatic leaders. S. P. Mookerjee was dead and",
  "Jayaprakash Narayan had abandoned politics for social service. Across north-ern India the Congress was virtually unchallenged. It won 195 seats in the",

  "Itsoveralltriumphnotwithstanding,therewereworryingsignsforaparty",

  "the Indo-Gangetic plain a variety of challenges were taking shape. In Orissa",
  "the Congress was opposed by the Ganatantra Parishad \u2013 a grouping of loc-",
  "al landlords \u2013 which, with the parties of the left, reduced it to a tally of 7",
  "seats out of 20. In Bombay province, once the heartland of Indian national-",
  "ism,theCongresswon38seatsoutofatotalof66.Mostoftheotherswentto",

  "Samiti garnered 5.5 million votes to the Congress\u2019s 5.3 million.) These losses",
  "were reproduced in the local elections which followed, with the Samiti cap-",
  "turing the municipalities of the great historic cities of Poona and Bombay.",
  "A regional challenge was also brewing in the south. This took the shape",
  "of the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (or DMK), a party which grew out of the",
  "Dravidian movement started by E. V. Ramaswami Naicker. Known as \u2018Peri-",

  "the first they took part in. Although they won but a handful of seats \u2013 these",
  "mostly in the assembly polls \u2013 their creeping successes were worrying, since",

  "From the late nineteenth century Kerala had been in a state of social fer-",
  "ment. These changes were being directed by four kinds of actors. First, there",
  "were the missionaries who, because of the Christian influence, found it easi-",
  "er to work here than in other parts of British India. Their Churches promoted",
  "modern education through a vast, interconnected network of schools and col-",
  "leges.Second,therewerethesuccessiveMaharajasofCochinand(especially)",

  "thedominant landed caste; andtheSreeNarayana Dharma Paripalana, named",
  "for Narayana Guru, the legendary leader of the Ezhavas, the caste of toddy-",
  "tappers ranked low in the ritual hierarchy. These too ran their educational in-",
  "stitutions, as well as societies devoted to welfare and charity. Finally, there",
  "werethepoliticalparties,whichincludedtheCongress,ofcourse,andalsothe",
  "Communist Party of India.8",
  "The Kerala unit of the CPI was strongly rooted in the local soil. Its most",
  "influential leaders had started life in the Congress, then graduated leftwards.",
  "They started peasant unions to demand security for tenants and labour unions",
  "to demand better wages and working conditions for the landless. They insti-",
  "tuted \u2018reading rooms\u2019 where intellectuals communicated radical ideas to their",
  "underprivileged audiences. Theatre and dance were also pressed into the ser-",
  "vice of left-wing propaganda. Through the late 1930s and beyond the com-",
  "munists made steady gains, their ideas and manifest idealism appealing to a",
  "divided society further hit by depression and war.",
  "In a country generally riven by inequality, Kerala still stood out for",
  "the oppressiveness of its caste system. Here, the lowest of the low were not",
  "merely \u2018untouchable\u2019 , but even \u2018unseeable\u2019 . When a Namboodiri Brahmin",
  "approached,aParaiyalabourerhadtocryoutinadvance,lestthesightofhim",
  "pollute his superior. Yet the combined efforts of the missionaries, the princes,",
  "the caste societies and the communists had seriously undermined traditional",
  "structures of authority. In a mere half-century, between 1900 and 1950, de-",
  "fiance had replaced deference as the idiom of social exchange in the Kerala",
  "countryside.9",
  "When, after 1947, universal suffrage came to the state, the communists",
  "were in a very goodposition to exploit it. But instead they went underground,followingordersfromMoscow.Theyresurfacedintimeforthe1952election,",
  "and made a decent showing. Through the 1950s they worked steadily at ex-",
  "panding their influence. In February 1956, less than a year before the Indian",
  "general election, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union had its 20th Con-",
  "gress. Here Khrushchev famously denounced Stalin, and in passing also en-",
  "dorsed the possibility of a peaceful transition to socialism. In the general sec-",
  "retary\u2019s words, \u2018The winning of a stable parliamentary majority backed by a",
  "mass revolutionary movement of the proletariat and of all the working people",
  "could create for the working class of a number of capitalist and former colo-",
  "nial countries the conditions needed to secure fundamental social changes.\u201910",
  "There would, of course, be no elections in the Soviet Union, but Big",
  "Brother now did not mind, indeed perhaps approved of, participation in elec-",
  "tions by comrades elsewhere. (This shift was caused in part by imperatives of",
  "foreign policy \u2013 competing with their fellow superpower for allies, the Russi-",
  "ans had to cultivate ex-colonial regimes that were of ten unsympathetic to re-",
  "volutionary communism.) The communists in Kerala could now throw them-",
  "selves more energetically into their campaign. Their manifesto declared that",
  "they wished only to make this a \u2018democratic and prosperous state\u2019 , by start-",
  "ing new industries, increasing food production, raising wages of workers in",
  "factories and farms, nationalizing plantations, building houses and streamlin-",
  "ing schools. The party of protest sought to become a party of governance; a",
  "transitionwhich,ittoldthevoter,itsstewardshipoflocalbodieshadprepared",
  "it for. As the manifesto declared,",
  "the people also know that the administration of many municipalities and",
  "of the Malabar District Board under the leadership of the Communist",
  "Party is better than before, and that both the panchayats [village coun-",
  "cils]whichwonawardsfromPrimeMinisterNehruforgoodadministra-",
  "tion are under the leadership of the Communist Party. These experiences",
  "have made it clear that the Communist Party is capable not only of unit-",
  "ing the people for conducting agitation, but that it can also take over and",
  "run the administration successfully.11",

  "Virtually the first act of the new government was to commute the sen-",

  "The aims of the Agrarian Relations Bill introduced by EMS\u2019s govern-",
  "ment were modest: not the socialization or collectivization of land, not even",
  "thebestowingoflandtitlestothelandless,merelytheprovidingofstabilityoftenuretothemassofsmallpeasantswhocultivatedholdingsownedbyabsent-",

  "ceiling on ownership and redistribute the surplus land thus garnered. These",
  "wereimportantmeasures,helpinghundredsofthousandsofpoorpeasants,but",
  "still somewhat short of what the Red catechism prescribed. The contradiction",
  "was resolved by recourse to the \u2018stages\u2019 theory of classical Marxism. It was",
  "argued that rural India was still \u2018semi-feudal\u2019. All non-feudal classes were to",
  "be rallied around the proposed reforms which, when in place, would unleash",
  "agrarian capitalism, the next, necessary stop in the high road to socialism.17",
  "The standard history of Kerala communism is subtitled \u2018a study in polit-",
  "ical adaptation\u2019 (to bourgeois democracy). Reformism in agriculture was",
  "one manifestation of this; a second, which must surely have confused the",
  "cadres more, was the encouragement of private enterprise. The party\u2019s mani-",
  "festo had threatened the nationalization of plantations, many of them foreign-",
  "owned. After the election this was quietly abandoned. Then, within its first",
  "few months in office, the Kerala government invited India\u2019s largest capitalist",
  "house, the Birlas, to setup a rayon factory in Mavoor. The entrepreneurs were",
  "assured subsidized supplies of bamboo \u2013 to be gifted to the Birlas at one",
  "rupee per tonne, when the prevailing market price was perhaps a thousand",
  "times as much. This project constituted, on the capitalist\u2019s side, a breaking",
  "of ranks, for the Indian industrial class detested the communists. Their hope",
  "wasthatthecentralgovernmentwouldbelikewiseexercisedbytheRedmen-",
  "ace; that \u2018Home Minister Pant and his New Delhi group [of Congress politi-",
  "cians] comes down on the Kerala Communists with a heavy hand and knocks",
  "them out of office\u2019.18 The pragmatic Birlas, however, were responding to the",
  "factthattheCPIcontrolledtradeunionsinimportantindustrialcentresoutside",
  "Kerala. To start a plant here was to buy peace here \u2013 as well as elsewhere. As",
  "one columnist archly commented, it was hard to believe that the clan\u2019s patri-",
  "arch, Ghanshyamdas Birla, had succumbed to the \u2018superlative charm of Chief",
  "Minister Namboodiripad\u2019; it was more likely that he was \u2018getting ready for a",
  "Communist triumph in Bengal, where his interests are concentrated\u2019.19",
  "In office, as in opposition, the communists attracted a wide range of in-",
  "terested comment, this ranging from the warmly approbatory to the viciously",
  "hostile. There were those who wrote of an emerging new dawn, in terms re-",
  "miniscent of the opening pages of George Orwell\u2019s Homage to Catalonia,",
  "with its sincere salute to the soul of man under socialism. On the first an-",

  "for recruitment, and by prescribing salaries and humane working conditions.",
  "It also gave the state the powers to take over schools that did not abide by the",
  "bill\u2019s provisions.23",
  "The opposition to the bill was led by the Church, whose own powers \u2013",
  "moral as well as material -depended crucially on its control of educational in-",

  "As it happened, the minister of education, Joseph Mundaserry, had spent",
  "decades teaching in a Catholic college in Trichur. He knew the corruptions of",
  "the system, and his bill was in some respects a brave attempt to correct them.",
  "However, his government sought to go further than modernize the manage-",
  "ment; it wanted also to introduce changes in the curriculum. New textbooks",
  "were prepared which sought subtly \u2013 and not so subtly \u2013 to present history",
  "through communist lenses. The lenses used by Christian pedagogues were",

  "tain themselves in power, they dissolved the Duma on the ground that it",
  "was reactionary. Local Soviets who did not support the Bolsheviks were",
  "also disbanded. Private schools were forbidden and education was taken",

  "Here were two alternative visions of the kind of society Kerala should be-",
  "come; masquerading as two alternative readings of the Russian Revolution.",
  "One can see how the Christian version would enrage the Communists, and",
  "vice versa. Inanyevent, the textbook rowadded fuel toanalready well-burn-",
  "ing fire. For by this time the Christians opposing the bill had been joined by",
  "theNairs,theothercommunity thatloomedlargeintheeconomic lifeofKer-",
  "ala. Where the Christians had always supported the Congress, the Nairs were",
  "split down the middle; about half of them had voted for the communists, the",
  "other half against. However, since the Nair Service Society also ran schools",
  "and colleges, the new bill helped tilt them against the communists and into a",
  "somewhat opportunistic alliance with theChristians.26",
  "More opportunistic still was the local Congress Party. Defeated in the",
  "election, it saw in the resentment against the Educational Bill a chance to re-",
  "gain power. Its leaders proposed an anti-communist popular front, an idea at-",
  "tractive to \u2018the reactionary Catholic Church, landlords, planters and the other",
  "disgruntled elements\u2019, but a seeming betrayal of the socialistic philosophy of",
  "its leaders at the centre.27 Through the latter part of 1958 there were a series",
  "of strikes and protest marches in Kerala. In one incident in Trichur the police",
  "fired on a crowd of Congress Party members, killing six.28",
  "Feeling besieged, E. M. S. Namboodiripad was compelled to state his",
  "case through the pages of the country\u2019s most popular English-language",
  "weekly. Their \u2018opponents were scandalised\u2019, he said, because his government",

  "was eighty), Mannath reminded them of Bhishma Pitamah, the octogenarian",
  "warriorwhohadledthePandavasintotheirowndharmayuddh,orholywar.32",
  "The clash in Kerala is perhaps best understood in terms of the political",
  "theorist W. H. Morris-Jones\u2019s characterization of the three \u2018idioms\u2019 of Indian",
  "politics. The first of these idioms was the \u2018modern\u2019, basing itself on universal",
  "ideas offreedom andjustice, andexpressed inParliament, thelawcourts,and",
  "the English-language press. The second was the \u2018traditional\u2019, which emphas-",
  "ized primordial loyalties, the interests of one\u2019s caste or religion.",
  "In its first phase the Education Bill controversy was, like so much else",
  "inmodernIndia,simply aclash between themodernandtraditional idioms of",
  "politics. But Mannath Padmanabhan brought with him yet a third idiom: the",
  "\u2018saintly\u2019 .Morris-Jones himself sawthisidiom asoperating \u2018atthemargin\u2019 of",
  "Indian politics \u2013 as in the social work of Vinoba Bhave. Mannath, however,",
  "brought this idiom into a direct engagement with the other two \u2013 as,long be-",
  "fore, and to even more spectacular effect, had Mahatma Gandhi. The people",
  "of Kerala followed him in part for the same reasons that the people of India",
  "had followed Gandhi; namely, that his personal integrity was unimpeachable,",
  "and that he had never sought or held political office.33Mannath\u2019s arrival gave a huge boost to the movement, which soon con-",
  "tained, in the patriarch\u2019s words, \u2018everyone in Kerala who is not a Commun-",
  "ist\u2019. On 1 May 1959 a conference of community organizations met at Chan-",
  "ganacherry to form a Vimochana Samara Samiti, or Liberation Committee,",
  "under Mannath\u2019s leadership. Over the next month its members carried their",
  "message into schools and colleges, churches and temples, into the homes of",
  "fisherfolk, peasants, merchants and workers.",
  "By early June thousands of volunteers were ready to court arrest. Now",

  "a modern pluralist state.",
  "Now, a decade later, the Congress was once more under attack from the",
  "far edges of the political spectrum. The left\u2019s challenge this time was demo-",
  "cratic, and hence potentially more dangerous. For if EMS\u2019s government was",

  "Asithappened,therewasalsoanewchallengefromtheright.Thiscame",
  "from C. Rajagopalachari, \u2018Rajaji\u2019, the veteran Congress politician who had",
  "previouslyservedasgovernorofBengal,governorgeneralofIndiaandUnion",
  "home minister. In 1952 the Congress asked Rajaji to take over as chief minis-",
  "terofMadrasprovince.HestayedinthatpostuntilApril1954,whenhisparty",
  "indicated that they wanted the powerful backward-caste leader K. Kamaraj to",
  "replace him. Now Rajaji settled down in a small house to spend his days, he",
  "said, reading and writing. (He was an accomplished short-story writer in his",
  "nativeTamil,andhadalsowrittenmasterfulversionsoftheRamayanaandthe",
  "Mahabharata.)",
  "However, philosophy and literature proved inadequate substitutes for",
  "public affairs. Thus Rajaji was moved to comment from time to time on the",
  "nuclear arms race between Russia and America, with regard to which he took",
  "a line not dissimilar to Nehru\u2019s. Then, when the second five-year plan com-",
  "mitted the government of India to a socialist model of economics, he began",
  "commenting on domestic affairs too. Here, however, he came to be increas-",
  "ingly at odds with the prime minister.",
  "The differences were in part political. Rajaji felt that the Congress had",
  "become complacent in the absence of a strong opposition. In October 1956",
  "he made public his belief that there should be an opposition group within the",
  "Congress, without which \u2013 so he feared \u2013 the party \u2018would simply degenerate",
  "intoahuntinggroundforeverykindofambitionandself-seeking\u2019.43Thepro-",
  "posal was rejected; so the veteran turned to promoting an opposition outside",
  "the Congress instead. In May 1958 he published an article with the provocat-",
  "ivetitle\u2018Wanted:IndependentThinking\u2019.Thisarguedthat\u2018probablythemaincause for the collapse of independent thinking\u2019 in India was \u2018the long reign",
  "of popular favourites without any significant opposition\u2019. However, a healthy",
  "democracy required \u2018an opposition that thinks differently and does not just",
  "want more of the same, a group of vigorously thinking citizens which aims",
  "at the general welfare, and not one that in order to get more votes from the",
  "so-calledhave-nots,offersmoretothemthanthepartyinpowerhasgiven,an",
  "opposition that appeals to reason . . .\u201944",
  "The differences between Nehru and Rajaji were also economic. Rajaji",
  "worried that the second five-year plan would lead to an excessive centraliz-",
  "ation of state power. He was disturbed by the massive increases in taxation,",
  "conceived in the interests of the public sector, but which might only serve to",
  "\u2018discourage and deject citizens and wither the private sector\u2019. In his view, the",
  "plan must \u2018be conceived as a supplement to rather than a substitute for the",
  "market economy\u2019.45",
  "In May 1959, and touching eighty, Rajaji launched a new political party,",
  "the Swatantra Party. This party focused its criticisms on the \u2018personality cult\u2019",
  "around the prime minister, and on the economic policies of the ruling Con-",
  "gress. Its founding statement asked for a \u2018proper decentralized distribution of",
  "industry\u2019throughthenurturingof\u2018competitiveenterprise\u2019and,inagriculture,",
  "for the encouragement of the \u2018self-employed peasant proprietor who stands",
  "for initiative and freedom\u2019. It rejected the \u2018techniques of so-called socialism\u2019",
  "and the \u2018bringing into being of \u201cStatism\u201d.\u201946",
  "A democracy run by a single party automatically becomes a tyranny;",
  "such was Rajaji\u2019s rationale for starting Swatantra. For \u2018the Congress Party",
  "has so far run without a true Opposition. It has run with accelerators and no",
  "brakes.\u201947 This party started by an octogenarian quickly gathered momentum.",
  "Those whojoined upincluded captains ofindustry,naturally,but also peasant",
  "leaders worried by Congress threats to promote \u2018co-operative farming\u2019. Al-",
  "though conventionally described as \u2018conservative\u2019, the party was in fact a",
  "curious amalgam of free-market liberals and agrarian leaders seeking an al-",
  "ternative to the Congress.48",
  "Congresscheerleaders dismissedSwatantraasapartyof\u2018rightreaction\u2019.",
  "The prime minister himself affected an airy disdain. When asked at a press",

  "Kanpurownedbyanindustrialist named Haridas Mundhra.Whenthefinance",

  "this questionable transaction with the mystery man of India\u2019s business under-",
  "world\u2019 . There was, Feroze Gandhi concluded, \u2018a conspiracy to beguile the",
  "[state-owned] Corporation of its funds\u2019.50",
  "Bowingtothecriticism,thegovernmentannouncedaCommissionofIn-",
  "quiry into the affair. In fact there were two separate and successive enquiries,",
  "each headed by an eminent judge. Their findings were not complimentary to",
  "the Congress government. The LIC had a publicly stated \u2018blue-chip\u2019 policy,",
  "which committed it to investing money only in firms of high reputation and",
  "sound management. The Mundhra companies were neither; yet the Corpora-",
  "tion had seen fit to make its largest ever investment in its stock. The officials",

  "The proceedings of these Commissions were held in Delhi and Bombay,",

  "People flocked to the hearings, there to see the minister and his officials",
  "fumble under questioning or contradict one another. The final reports of the",
  "judges were damning, and exacted a price: both the minister and his secretary",
  "were forced to demit office.51",
  "The judicial probe into the LIC investment in the Mundhra companies,",

  "Chou En-lai had made his mark as \u2018an urbane and skilful diplomat\u2019, appear-",

  "were Asian\u2019.5",
  "In1955ChouandNehrumighthavebeendividedonlybypoliticalideo-",
  "logy. By 1958 they were divided also by national interest. In December of",
  "that year the Indian prime minister wrote the first of a long series of letters",
  "to Chou. Nehru began by expressing admiration for China\u2019s economic pro-",
  "gress before turning, gingerly and gently, to the question of the border. When",
  "they met in 1956, recalled Nehru, the Chinese leader had indicated that he",
  "thought the McMahon Line was a legacy of British imperialism, but \u2018because",
  "of the friendly relations\u2019 between China and India, his government would,",
  "after consulting with the local Tibetan authorities, give it recognition. Chou",
  "had then confirmed Nehru\u2019s impression that \u2018there was no major boundary",
  "disputebetweenChinaandIndia\u2019.ButnowcamethismapinChinaPictorial,",
  "whose borderline \u2018went right across Indian territory\u2019.",
  "A month later Chou En-lai replied, stating that \u2018historically no treaty",
  "or agreement on the Sino-Indian boundary has ever been concluded\u2019. The",
  "McMahon Line was \u2018a product of the British policy of aggression against the",
  "Tibet Region of China\u2019. Juridically speaking, \u2018it cannot be considered legal\u2019.",
  "The Indians had protested about a road in an area which, in Chou\u2019s opinion,\u2018has always been under Chinese jurisdiction. \u2018All this shows that [contrary",
  "to Nehru\u2019s claim] border disputes do exist between China and India\u2019. That",
  "was the context in which the China Pictorial map should be viewed. Chou",
  "suggested that both sides temporarily maintain the status quo, pending a final",
  "\u2018friendly settlement\u2019 on the border question.",
  "On 22 March 1959 Nehru wrote back. He was \u2018somewhat surprised\u2019 to",
  "hear that the frontier between India and the \u2018Tibet Region of China\u2019 was not",
  "accepted by Peking, for it had the sanction of several specific agreements.",
  "These included those forged between Kashmir and Lhasa in 1842 and, in",
  "the east, the McMahon Line agreed upon in 1913-14. Besides, there were",
  "clear natural features, watersheds and mountain tops, that defined the bor-",
  "ders between the two countries. There might be gaps here and there, but, said",
  "Nehru, for \u2018much the larger part of our boundary with China, there is suffi-",
  "cientauthoritybasedongeography,traditionaswellastreatiesforthebound-",
  "ary as shown in our published maps\u2019. The letter ended with the hope that \u2018an",
  "early understanding in this matter will be reached\u2019.",
  "Before Chou En-lai could reply, the Dalai Lama fled to India. This",
  "greatly complicated matters, as the Chinese were deeply resentful of the pop-",
  "ular welcome given him by large sections of the Indian public. For this they",
  "blamed New Delhi. Had not the granting of an audience by Nehru himself",
  "given an unfortunate legitimacy to the Tibetan leader? Peking\u2019s position was",
  "that the Tibetan revolt, far from being a popular uprising, was the product of",
  "\u2018fugitive upper-class reactionaries\u2019 aided by the \u2018American imperialists\u2019 and",
  "the \u2018Chiang Kai-shek clique\u2019. Sections of the Chinese media went so far as to",
  "claim that the Indian town of Kalimpong was the \u2018commanding centre of the",
  "revolt\u2019, that the Delhi government was being influenced by \u2018imperialist pro-",
  "paganda and intrigues\u2019 and that \u2018Sino-Indian friendship was being destroyed",
  "from the Indian side\u2019.6",
  "There was some propaganda activity by Tibetan refugees in Kalimpong,",
  "the import of which was, however, greatly exaggerated by the Chinese. In",
  "fact,muchlouderprotestshademanatedfromIndiansources,inparticularthe",
  "politician turned social worker Jayaprakash Narayan. \u2018JP\u2019 was a fervent ad-",
  "vocate for Tibetan independence, a cause also supported by other, less dis-",
  "interested elements in Indian politics, such as the Jana Sangh, which wanted",
  "New Delhi openly to ally with the United States in the Cold War and seek",
  "its assistance in \u2018liberating\u2019 Tibet.7 But, as the foreign secretary assured the",
  "Chinese ambassador a month after the Dalai Lama\u2019s flight into exile, \u2018India",
  "hashadandhasnodesiretointerfereininternalhappeningsinTibet\u2019.Theex-",
  "iledleader\u2018willbeaccordedrespectfultreatmentinIndia,butheisnotexpec-ted to carry out any political activities from this country\u2019. This was the gov-",
  "ernment\u2019s position, from which some Indians would naturally dissent. For, as",
  "the foreign secretary pointed out, \u2018there is by law and Constitution complete",
  "freedom of expression of opinion in Parliament and the press and elsewhere",
  "in India. Opinions are often expressed in severe criticism of the Government",
  "of India\u2019s policies.\u2019",
  "This was not a nuance Peking could easily understand. For, at least in",
  "public, there could not be any criticism of the government\u2019s policies within",
  "China. The difference between these two political systems \u2013 call them \u2018total-",
  "itarianism\u2019 and \u2018democracy\u2019 \u2013 was most strikingly reflected in an exchange",
  "about an incident that took place in Bombay on 20 April. According to the",
  "Chinese version \u2013 communicated to New Delhi by Peking in a letter dated 27",
  "April \u2013 a group of protesters raised slogans and made speeches which",
  "branded China\u2019s putting down of the rebellion in her own territory, the",
  "Tibetan Region, as [an] imperialist action and made all sorts of slanders.",
  "What is more serious is that they pasted up a portrait of Mao Tse-tung,",
  "Chairman of the People\u2019s Republic of China, on the wall of the Chinese",
  "Consulate-General and carried out wanton insult by throwing tomatoes",
  "and rotten eggs at it. While these ruffians were insulting the portrait, the",
  "Indian policemen stood by without interfering with them, and pulled off",
  "the encircling spectators for the correspondents to take photographs . . .",
  "This incident in Bombay constituted, in Peking\u2019s view, \u2018a huge insult to the",
  "headofstateofthePeople\u2019sRepublicofChinaandtherespectedandbeloved",

  "for a possible engagement with China, but Krishna Menon insisted that the",

  "organs such as the Bombay weekly Blitz, which claimed that Thimayya had",

  "sided with him in his battle with the defence minister were Blitz\u2019s great (and",
  "undeniably pro-American) rival, the weekly Current, as well as large sections",
  "of the non-ideological press. The normally pro-government Hindustan Times",
  "said that \u2018Krishna Menon must go\u2019, not Thimayya. It accused the minister of",
  "reducing the armed forces to a \u2018state of near-demoralization\u2019 by trying to cre-",
  "ate, at the highest level, a cell of officers who would be personally loyal to",
  "him.14",
  "Some hoped that the outcry over Thimayya\u2019s resignation would force",
  "Krishna Menon to also hand in his papers. Writing to the general, a leading",

  "troops started \u2018shielding armed Tibetan bandits\u2019 and began \u2018pressing forward",
  "steadily across the eastern section of the Sino-Indian boundary\u2019.Nehru replied almost at once, saying that the Indians \u2018deeply resent this",
  "allegation\u2019 that \u2018the independent Government of India are seeking to reap",
  "a benefit\u2019 from British imperialism. He pointed out that between 1914 and",
  "1947noChinesegovernmenthadobjectedtotheMcMahonLine.Herejected",
  "the charge that India was shielding armed Tibetans. And he expressed \u2018great",
  "shock\u2019 at the tone of Chou\u2019s letter, reminding him that India was one of thefirst countries to recognize the People\u2019s Republic and had consistently sought",
  "to be friend it.19",
  "By this time, the India\u2013China exchange comprised bullets as well as",
  "letters. In late August 1959 there was a clash of arms at Longju, along the",
  "McMahon Line in the eastern sector. Then in late October1959 an Indian",
  "patrol in the Kongka Pass area of Ladakh was attacked by a Chinese detach-",
  "ment. Nine Indian soldiers were killed, and as many captured. The Chinese",
  "maintainedthattheIndianshadcomedeliberatelyintotheirterritory;theIndi-",

  "ably, till this time responsibility for the border with China had rested not with",

  "CentralReservePoliceinthewest.Regularmilitaryforcesweremassedalong",
  "theborderwithPakistan,whichwasconsideredIndia\u2019smainandperhapssole",

  "vision was pulled out of Punjab and sent to NEFA. This was a considerable",
  "change; trained for tank warfare in the plains, the 4th would now have to op-",
  "erate in a very different terrain altogether.",
  "Through this new \u2018forward policy\u2019, the Indian government aimed to in-",
  "habit no-man\u2019s-land bysiting a series ofsmall posts along orclose to the bor-",
  "der. The operation was much touted in Delhi, where maps sprung up in De-",
  "fenceMinistryofficeswithlittlebluepinsmarkingwherethesepostshadbeen",
  "located. Not to be found on these maps were the simultaneous attempts by",
  "the Chinese to fill in the blanks, working from their side of what was now a",
  "deeply contested border.20",
  "IV",
  "By 1959, at least, it was clear that the Indian and Chinese positions were irre-",
  "concilable. The Indians insisted that the border was, for the most part, recog-",
  "nizedandassuredbytreatyandtradition; theChinesearguedthatithadnever",
  "really been delimited. The claims of both governments rested in part on the",
  "legacy of imperialism; British imperialism (for India), and Chinese imperial-",
  "ism(overTibet)forChina.Inthissense,bothclaimedsovereigntyoverterrit-",
  "ory acquired by less-than-legitimate means.In retrospect, it appears that the Indians underestimated the force of",
  "Chinese resentment against \u2018Western imperialism\u2019. In the first half of the",
  "twentiethcentury,whentheircountrywasweak,ithadbeensubjecttoallsorts",
  "of indignities by the European powers. The McMahon Line was one of them.",
  "Nowthat,underthecommunists,Chinawasstrong,itwasdeterminedtoundo",
  "the injustices of the past. Visiting Peking in November 1959, the Indian law-",
  "yer Danial Latifi was told by his Chinese colleagues that \u2018the McMahon Line",
  "had no juridical basis\u2019. Public opinion in China appeared \u2018to have worked it-",
  "self up to a considerable pitch\u2019 on the border issue. Reporting his conversa-",
  "tions to Jawaharlal Nehru, Latifi tellingly observed, \u2018As you know, probably",
  "too well, it is difficult in any country to make concessions once the public",
  "has been told it [the territory under dispute] forms part of the national home-",
  "land.\u201921",
  "It is also easy in retrospect to see that, after the failure of the Tibetan re-",
  "volt, the government of India should have done one or both of the following:",
  "(i) strengthened its defences along the Chinese border, importing arms from",
  "the West if need be; (ii) worked seriously for afresh settlement of the border",
  "with China. But the non-alignment of Nehru precluded the former and the",
  "force of public opinion precluded the latter. In October 1959 the Times of In-",
  "diacomplained thattheprimeminister hadshown\u2018anover-scrupulousregard",
  "for Chinese susceptibilities and comparative indifference towards the anger",
  "and dismay with which the Indian people have reacted\u2019.22 Another newspaper",
  "observed that Nehru was \u2018standing alone against the rising tide of national re-",
  "sentment against China\u2019.23",
  "As Steven Hoffman has suggested, the policy of releasing White Papers",
  "limited Nehru\u2019s options. Had the border dispute remained private the prime",
  "minister could have used the quieter back-channels of diplomatic comprom-",
  "ise. But with the matter out in the open, sparking much angry comment, he",
  "could only \u2018adopt those policies that could conceivably meet with approval",
  "from an emotionally aroused parliament and press\u2019. The White Paper policy",
  "precluded the spirit of give and take, and instead fanned patriotic sentiment.",
  "The Kongka Pass incident, in particular, had led to furious calls for revenge",
  "from India\u2019s political class.24",
  "After the border clashes of September and October 1959, Chou En-",
  "lai wrote suggesting that both sides withdraw twenty kilometres behind the",
  "McMahon Line in the east, and behind the line of actual control in the west.",
  "Nehru, in reply, dismissed the suggestion as merely a way of legitimizing",
  "Chinese encroachments in the western sector, of keeping \u2018your forcible pos-",
  "session intact\u2019. The \u2018cause of the recent troubles\u2019, he insisted, \u2018is action takenfrom your side of the border\u2019. Chou now pointed out that, despite its belief",
  "that the McMahon Line was illegal, China had adhered to a policy of \u2018abso-",
  "lutely not allowing its armed personnel to cross this line [while] waiting for a",
  "friendly settlement of the boundary question\u2019. Thus,",
  "the Chinese Government has not up to now made any demand in regard",
  "to the area south of the so-called McMahon line as a precondition or in-",
  "terim measure, and what I find difficult to understand is why the Indian",
  "Government should demand that the Chinese side withdraw one-sidedly",
  "from its western frontier area.",

  "Lattimore astutely summed up the Indian dilemma. Since the boundary with",
  "China was self-evidently a legacy of British imperialism, the \u2018cession of a",

  "sent a note to the prime minister reminding him of the \u2018popular feeling\u2019 with",
  "regard to China. They asked for an assurance that in his talks with Chou",

  "Bhave, would be free of anger, bitterness and suspicion.",
  "It was not a message that went down well or widely. Five days before",
  "Chou En-lai was due, the Jana Sangh held a large demonstration outside theprime minister\u2019s residence. Protesters held up placards reminding Nehru not",
  "toforgetthemartyrs ofLadakh andnottosurrender Indianterritory.Thenext",

  "wheretheprimeminister waswarnedthatifhestruckadealwiththeChinese",
  "his \u2018only allies would be the Communists and crypto-Communists\u2019. In this",
  "climate, the respected editor Frank Moraes thought the talks were doomed",
  "to failure. The gulf between the two countries was \u2018unbridgeable\u2019, he wrote,",
  "adding: \u2018If Mr Chou insists on maintaining all the old postures, all that Mr",
  "Nehrucan tell him politely is to go back to Peking and think again.\u2019",
  "Nehru, however, insisted that the Chinese prime minister \u2018would be ac-",
  "cordedacourteouswelcomebefittingthebesttraditionsofthiscountry\u2019.Chou",
  "was then on a visit to Burma; an Indian viscount went to pick him up and",
  "fly him to Delhi. When he came in 1956, he had been given a stirring pub-",
  "lic reception; this time \u2013 despite the Indian prime minister\u2019s hopes \u2013 he ar-",
  "rived \u2018amidst unprecedented security arrangements\u2019, travelling from the air-",
  "port in a closed car. The Hindu Mahasabha organized a \u2018black flag\u2019 demon-",
  "stration against Chou, but his visit was also opposed by the more mainstream",
  "parties. Two jokes doing the rounds expressed the mood in New Delhi. One",
  "held that \u2018Hindi-Chini Bhai Bhai\u2019 had become \u2018Hindi-Chini Bye Bye\u2019; the",
  "otheraskedwhyKrishnaMenonwasnotintheIndiandelegationforthetalks,",
  "and answered, \u2018Because he is in Mr Chou En-lai\u2019s party.\u201932",
  "Chou En-lai spent a week in New Delhi, meeting Nehru every day, with",
  "and without aides. A photograph reproduced in the Indian Express after the",
  "second day of the talks suggested that they were not going well. It showed",
  "Chou raising a toast to Sino-Indian friendship, by clinking his glass with Mrs",
  "Indira Gandhi\u2019s. Mrs Gandhi was stylishly dressed, in asari, but was looking",
  "quizzically across to her father. On the other side of the table stood Nehru,",
  "capless, drinking deeply and glumly from a wine glass while avoiding Chou",
  "En-lai\u2019sgaze.TheonlyIndianshowinganyinterestatallwasthevice-presid-",
  "ent, S. Radhakrishnan, seen reaching across to clink his glass with Chou\u2019s.",
  "Chou En-lai and Nehru spent nearly twenty hours in conversation. The",
  "transcripts of their talks are still officially secret, but copies kept by a vigilant",
  "(or rule-breaking) official have been consulted by this writer. These highlight",
  "vividly the hurt and hostility that pervaded the discussion. Nehru began by",
  "recalling all that India had done for China, such as introducing its leaders to",
  "theAsia-AfricaconferenceatBandungandpushingitscaseintheUnitedNa-",
  "tions. In the light of these good turns, the Chinese \u2018infringement\u2019 of India\u2019s",

  "which was that in view of the friendship, ancient and modern, between Indiaand China, \u2018the activities of the Dalai Lama and his followers have far ex-",
  "ceeded the limits of political asylum\u2019.",
  "For two days Nehru and Chou traded charges and counter-charges. If",
  "the Indian insisted that the Himalaya had long been considered his country\u2019s",
  "natural as well as demographic frontier, then the Chinese dismissed the",
  "McMahon Line as a pernicious legacy of imperialism. Both prime ministers",
  "showed an excellent grasp of detail, each defending his case with impressive",
  "exactitude, each mentioning specific villages, valleys, hilltops, rivers, posts",
  "and treaties to make or advance his country\u2019s claims. Finally, Chou suggested",
  "thattheytryto\u2018seekasolution\u2019ratherthan\u2018repeatarguments\u2019.Asuitableset-",
  "tlement, in his view, would be that \u2018neither side should put forward claims to",
  "an area which is no longer under its administrative control\u2019. Some hours later",
  "hebecamemoreexplicit,whenhesaidthat\u2018intheeasternsector,weacknow-",
  "ledge that what India considers its border has been reached by India\u2019s actual",
  "administration. But, similarly, we think that India should accept that China\u2019s",
  "administrativepersonnelhasreachedthelinewhichitconsiderstobeherbor-",
  "der in the western sector\u2019.",
  "Again, suitably decoded, this meant \u2013 your case is stronger in the west,",
  "butourneedsaregreaterthere.Andwhileourcaseisstrongerintheeast,per-",
  "haps more of your interests are at stake there. Please keep Tawang and its en-",
  "virons, Chou was saying, for all we want is Aksai Chin and the road linking",
  "Sinkiang and Tibet.",
  "Chou advocated the retention and recognition of the status quo, but as",
  "Nehru pointed out in reply, that term was itself disputed. \u2018The question is,",
  "what is status quo?\u2019 said the Indian Prime Minister. For \u2018the status quo of",
  "today is different from the status quo of one or two years ago. To maintain",
  "today\u2019sstatusquowouldbeveryunfairifitisdifferentfromapreviousstatus",
  "quo. The solution suggested by Chou would justify what, in Nehru\u2019s (and In-",
  "dia\u2019s) view, were gains made illegally and by stealth by China.33",
  "Chou En-lai also met the home minister, G. B. Pant, and the vice-presid-",
  "ent, Dr S. Radhakrishnan, both of whom complained, more in sorrow than in",
  "anger, of China\u2019s lack of appreciation for all India had done to gain its com-",
  "munist government legitimacy in the eyes of the world. Chou was more com-",
  "batively challenged by the brilliant and opinionated finance minister, Morarji",
  "Desai. When the Chinese leader asked how the Indians could have allowed",

  "by various linguistic groups left dissatisfied by the recommendations of the",

  "to press the centre to give them the city of Bombay. Their case was artfully",

  "this was the way the Congress could makeup the losses of the 1957 election,",

  "of the Sikhs. Anyway, throughout 1960 and 1961 the evergreen Master Tara",

  "Christian pastors and church leaders, burning men and women alive, burning",
  "churches\u2019. His pamphlet demanded an end to the \u2018slaughter\u2019, and the recog-",
  "nition by the government of India of \u2018the sovereign and independent state of",
  "Nagaland\u2019. Phizo said that an independent Nagaland would \u2018wish to remain",
  "within the fold of the Christian nations, and the Commonwealth . . . [T]iny",
  "Nagaland is happy to be a follower of Jesus Christ, whom we have come to",
  "believe in as our Saviour\u2019.44",
  "Phizo was here simultaneously appealing to the British love of the un-",
  "derdog, to memories of the still recent war against fascism (with the Nagas",
  "placed in the role of the Jews, and the Indian government as the Nazis) and to",
  "the Christian sentiments of his audience. The rhetoric was somewhat artless,",
  "and yet surprisingly successful. His cause was taken up by David Astor, the",
  "liberal owner of the Observer newspaper who had played a stellar role in the",
  "fight against the Nazis. Phizo\u2019s charges were given wide play by the paper,",
  "and by several other journals too.45",
  "Always sensitive to the opinions of the British press, the government of",
  "India answered with a propagandist tract of its own. This said that while the",
  "primeministerhadassuredtheNagasof\u2018maximumautonomy\u2019,underPhizo\u2019s",
  "leadership, \u2018the Naga movement began to assume a violent character\u2019. The",

  "theirinternalaffairsinadditiontoalltheprivilegesofIndiancitizenship,suchas representation in Parliament, but they could not agree to an independent",
  "state for them\u2019.",
  "This was reasonably put, but the effect was spoilt by an appendix which",
  "cast Phizo as a villain motivated merely by frustration and failure:",

  "andsetbacks.HefailedintheMatriculationexamination.Hisattemptsto",

  "However, between the government of India and the leader of the Naga",
  "National Council stood a number of \u2018moderate\u2019 Nagas. These had banded to-",
  "gether in a Naga Peoples\u2019 Convention which, from 1957 onwards, had be-",
  "gun seeking a peaceful settlement to the problem. The Aos were prominent",
  "among these peacemakers, but there were representatives of other tribes too.",
  "On 30 July 1960 the Naga Peoples\u2019 Convention presented a memorandum to",
  "the prime minister demanding a separate state of Nagaland within the Indian",
  "Union.Thiswouldhaveitsowngovernor,chiefminister,councilofministers,",

  "elite, loath to let go of any part of their province. But with the Naga question",
  "nowsuccessfullyinternationalized,Nehruthoughtitprudenttomakethecon-",
  "cession. In the first week of August 1960 he announced in Parliament that a",
  "state of Nagaland was to be carved out of Assam. The decision to create this,",
  "the smallest state of the Union, gave rise to a series of responses that were in-",
  "teresting, varied and yet utterly predictable. The right-wing Jana Sangh saw",
  "thecreationofNagalandas\u2018anactfraughtwithexplosivepossibilities\u2019;itwas",
  "a concession to terror, \u2018tantamount to putting a premium on violence and re-",
  "bellion\u2019, a wanton encouragement to \u2018regionalism and parochialism\u2019 which",
  "would endanger \u2018the unity and integrity of the country\u2019 . Some other tribes in",
  "Assam, the Khasis, the Garos and the Jaintias, resolved to fight for a state of",
  "their own, to be called \u2018Eastern Frontier\u2019.48Also predictable was the response of Phizo\u2019s men. Some Naga intellec-",
  "tualsthoughtthatthegrantingofstatehoodwithinIndiawas\u2018notonlyallthey",
  "can hope to get but all they need to protect their social and political identity\u2019.",
  "But how was one to convince the ordinary villager of this? For, as one news-",
  "paper noted, the \u2018armed rebels can emerge from the jungle any night with ar-",

  "More worrying, at least to Nehru, was the resurgence of communal con-",
  "flict after a decade of comparative social peace. In June 1960 virulent anti-",
  "Bengali riots broke out in Assam. The victims were post-Partition refugees",
  "from East Bengal, who were accused of taking jobs from the Assamese and",
  "not speaking their language. Thousands of homes were destroyed and many",
  "Bengalis killed. Others fled across the border into refugee camps in West",
  "Bengal. The home minister, Lal Bahadur Shastri, flew to Assam to forge an",
  "uneasy peace which endorsed Assamese as the official state language while",
  "permitting the use of Bengali in the district where the migrants were in a ma-",
  "jority.51",
  "Then,inJanuary1961,areligiousriotbrokeoutinthecentralIndiancity",

  "rioting continued for days, spreading also to the countryside. It was the most",
  "serious such incident since Partition, its main sufferers being poor Muslims,",
  "mostly weavers and bidi (cigarette) workers.52The troubles on the border with China and the intensification of social",
  "conflict within the country gave rise to fresh concerns about the future of",
  "democratic India. In 1960 an American scholar published an impressively",
  "learned book with a simple title \u2013 India \u2013 but a portentous subtitle: The Most",
  "DangerousDecades.Thechapterandsectiontitleswerealsorevealing\u2013\u2018Will",
  "the Union Survive?\u2019 was one, \u2018Totalitarian Equilibrium?\u2019 another. The writer",
  "was disturbed by the divisions of caste, region, religion and language, and",
  "by the rise of Indian communism. There were, he felt, \u2018seemingly irresistible",
  "compulsions of totalitarian experiments of one sort or another in the nature of",
  "the Indian Union\u2019.53",
  "The following year, 1961, the writer Aldous Huxley visited India after",
  "a gap of thirty-five years. He was overwhelmed by what he found, namely,",
  "\u2018the prospect of overpopulation, underemployment, growing unrest\u2019. \u2018India",
  "is almost infinitely depressing\u2019, he wrote to a friend, \u2018for there seems to be",
  "no solution to its problems in any way that any of us [in the West] regard",
  "as acceptable.\u2019 Writing to his brother Julian, Huxley expressed the view that",
  "\u2018whenNehrugoes,thegovernmentwillbecomeamilitarydictatorship\u2013asin",
  "so many of the newly independent states, for the army seems to be the only",
  "highly organized centre of power\u2019.54",
  "TheverdictoftheBritishintellectualwasechoedbytheworkadayjourn-",
  "alist. Visiting India soon after Huxley, a reporter for the London Daily Mail",
  "thought that \u2018until now Nehru alone has been the unifying, cohesive force",
  "behind India\u2019s Government and foreign policy\u2019. But after he was gone, \u2018the",
  "powers of caste and religion, of Rightism and Leftism . . . could eventually",
  "split this country from top to bottom and plunge it back 100 years\u2019.55",

  "tions of their air space by Indian aircraft; an Indian note listed various incid-",
  "ents of ill-treatment of Indian citizens in Tibet.56",
  "These exchanges, published in successive White Papers by the govern-",
  "ment of India, led to a renewed call for Krishna Menon\u2019s head. Leading thecharge was J. B. Kripalani, the Socialist Party MP from Sitamarhi in Bihar.",
  "Scholar, teacher, khadi worker and rebel, Kripalani was an authentic hero of",
  "the Indian freedom struggle. His moral authority derived in part from the",
  "fact that he had come close to Gandhi while aiding him in the Champaran",
  "satyagrahaof1917,yearsbeforeNehruhimselfmadetheacquaintanceofthe",
  "Mahatma. Kripalani had also been president of the Congress and, of course,",
  "spent many years in jail for his cause.",
  "On 11 April 1961 Kripalani delivered what was described at the time as",
  "\u2018perhaps the greatest speech that has been made on the floor of that House",
  "since Independence\u2019. This was a blistering attack on the defence minister.",
  "Under Krishna Menon\u2019s stewardship, said Kripalani, \u2018we have lost 12,000",
  "square miles of our territory without striking a single blow\u2019. Army promo-",
  "tions, he claimed, were based not on merit but \u2018according to the whims and",
  "fancies of the defence minister or what will suit his political and ideologic-",
  "al purposes\u2019. Menon had \u2018created cliques [and] lowered the morale of our",
  "[armed] forces\u2019. In a stinging indictment, Kripalani charged the minister with",
  "\u2018wasting the money of this poor and starving nation\u2019, with \u2018the neglect of the",
  "defence of the country\u2019, and with \u2018having lent his support to the totalitarian",
  "and dictatorial regimes against the will of the people for freedom\u2019.",
  "Kripalaniendedhisspeechwithanappealtotheconscienceofthemem-",
  "bers of the ruling party. Recalling how, back in 1940, the Conservative mem-",

  "afraidoftheBritishbulletsandbayonetstoplacethegoodofthenationabove",
  "the good of the party\u2019. With this parting shot Kripalani sat down, to vigorous",
  "applause from the opposition benches.57",
  "Throughout the second half of 1961 the Indian Parliament witnessed a",
  "series of bitter debates about the dispute with China. The prime minister him-",

  "turning a blind eye to Chinese \u2018occupation\u2019 of Indian territory and of placing",
  "himself magisterially above the fray. \u2018In regard to border disputes\u2019, said one",
  "member, \u2018the prime minister has a tendency to act like an umpire in a cricket",
  "match rather than as one whose interests are involved\u2019. The criticisms had a",
  "personal, polemical, edge. For Nehru also served as foreign minister, and the",
  "policy of friendship with China was known to be his particular project. Unac-",
  "customed to such hostility, the prime minister became increasingly irritable,on one occasion going so far as to refer to his critics as \u2018childish and infant-",
  "ile\u2019. 58",
  "Bynow,therewereelementsinhisownpartywhohadmadeknowntheir",
  "view that the prime minister should take a stronger line on China. When an",

  "in was barren land, with no grass growing on it, a Congress MP added this",
  "telling supplement: \u2018No hair grows on my head. Does it mean that the head",
  "has no value?\u2019 This was widely viewed as a dig at Nehru who, of course, was",
  "completely bald himself.59",
  "VIII",
  "In the third week of December 1961 a detachment of the Indian army moved",
  "up to the borders of the Portuguese colony of Goa. For a decade now New",
  "Delhi had sought, by persuasion and non-violence, to convince Portugal to",
  "give up that territory. With those measures failing, Nehru\u2019s government de-",
  "cided to \u2018liberate\u2019 Goa by force.",
  "On the morning of 18 December Indian troops entered Goa from three",
  "directions: Sawantwadi in the north, Karwar in the south and Belgaum in the",
  "east.Meanwhile,aeroplanesdroppedleaflets exhortingtheGoansto\u2018becalm",

  "the locals, who pointed out where the Portuguese had laid mines. The colon-",
  "ists fired a few shots before withdrawing. In the smaller enclaves of Daman",
  "and Diu the resistance was somewhat stiffer. In all, some fifteen Indian sol-",
  "diers lost their lives, and perhaps twice as many Portuguese. Thirty-six hours",
  "after the invasion began, the Portuguese governor general signed a document",
  "of unconditional surrender.60",
  "TheWesternpresshadafielddaywiththisdisplayof\u2018Indianhypocrisy\u2019.",
  "Exposed for so long to lectures by Nehru and Krishna Menon, they now hit",
  "back by attacking the use of force by a nation that professed \u2018non-violence\u2019.",
  "The action was also represented as a breach of international law and, more",
  "absurdly, as a threat to Christians and Christianity in Goa.61 In fact, 61 per",
  "cent of Goa was Hindu, while prominent Goan Christians, such as the journ-",
  "alist Frank Moraes and the Archbishop Cardinal Gracias, had an honoured",
  "placeinIndianpubliclife.Therehadlongbeenanindigenousfreedommove-",
  "ment within Goa and many, perhaps most, Goans welcomed the Indian ac-tion. In any case, the Goans were now at liberty to choose their own leaders,",
  "something always denied them by the Portuguese.",
  "That Goa was legitimately part of India was not in dispute. That India",
  "had waited long enough before acting was also evident. Still, the timing of",
  "whatwascalled\u2018OperationVijay\u2019wasopentoquestion.Whydidittakeplace",
  "inDecember1961ratherthanDecember1960orDecember1962?Nehruper-",
  "haps thought he had waited long enough for the Portuguese to leave; fourteen",
  "whole years. And he was under pressure from both left and right on the issue;",
  "theJanaSanghandthecommunists,inarareshowofagreement,wereurging",
  "him to use the army to liberate the colony. Still, the suspicion lingered that",
  "the precise timing of the invasion was determined by the electoral needs of",
  "his colleague Krishna Menon. Before the troops went in, the defence minister",
  "inspected them on the border. As the New York Times reported, he was here",
  "\u2018conductingadoublecampaign:oneforthewarthatwasabouttocommence,",
  "theotherforthegeneralelectionthathadbeenscheduledforFebruary1962.62",
  "In that election, Krishna Menon would be opposed by his Parliamentary",
  "b\u00eate noire, Acharya Kripalani, who had announced that he would shift from",
  "thesafeseatofSitamarhiandtakeonthedefenceministerintheconstituency",
  "he represented, North Bombay. All the opposition parties (the communists",
  "excepted) announced that they would support him. A battle of prestige was",
  "brewing;sincetheprimeministerhadrefusedtodropMenonfromtheCabin-",
  "et, the opposition now hoped that he would be removed via the ballot box.",
  "Less than two months after his troops marched into Goa, Menon was in",
  "Bombay to fight his corner of the 1962 general election. Batting for him were",
  "the powerful Maharashtra chief minister Y. B. Chavan and senior members",
  "of the Union Cabinet. Even Menon\u2019s known critics in government, such as",
  "Morarji Desai and Jagjivan Ram, were commanded to go out and campaign",
  "on his behalf. Speaking on Kripalani\u2019s side were such stalwarts as C. Rajago-",
  "palachari, as well as many distinguished non-party men \u2013 lawyers, intellectu-",
  "als and industrialists.",
  "The contest was, among other things, a tribute to the cosmopolitan char-",
  "acter of Bombay, with a Malayali and a Sindhi competing for the affections",
  "of the people of a state not their own. The constituency was very heterogen-",
  "eous indeed \u2013 many Marathi and Gujarati speakers, but also many Bhaiyyas",
  "from UP, Goans, Sindhis and Tamilians. These various segments were wooed",
  "by both contestants, with the campaign manifesting an intensity commensur-",
  "ate to the stature of the disputants, and the importance of their dispute.",

  "The campaign was colourful, replete with evocative posters and savage",
  "slogans. The left-wing weekly Blitz ran a blistering campaign against a man",
  "they chose to refer to as \u2018Cripple-loony\u2019 . On the other side, Menon was lam-",
  "pooned by versifiers in several languages. One ditty went: Chini hamla hot\u00e9",

  "(As China advances, Menon sleeps/ Let him sleep if he must/ But call Kripa-",

  "In the general elections of 1952 and 1957 the Congress had made much of its",
  "being the party of the freedom struggle. In 1962, however, its campaign fo-",
  "cused more on what it had done since. Its policies, it said, had increased ag-",
  "ricultural and industrial production, enhanced education and life expectancy",
  "and promoted the unity of the country. Never having held power, the oppos-",
  "ition could not match these claims with counterclaims of their own.64 In the",
  "event, the Congress comfortably retained its majority in Parliament, winning",
  "361 seats out of 494 all told. The communists secured 29 seats, while the",
  "new opposition party, Swatantra, put up a decent show, returning 18 MPs. Inthe state of Madras there was a challenge from the quasi-secessionist DMK,",
  "whichwon7Parliamentary seats(togowith50intheLegislative Assembly).",
  "But on the whole the Congress Party was confirmed in its pre-eminence, and",
  "Jawaharlal Nehru entered into his fourth term as prime minister.",
  "The opposition within had been shown its place, but the opposition",
  "without remained. Throughout the spring and summer of 1962 clashes on the",
  "border continued. In July the Delhi journal Seminar ran a symposium on In-",
  "dia\u2019s defence policy. One contributor insisted that \u2018the People\u2019s Republic of",
  "China does not pose any military threat to our country\u2019. Another contributor",
  "was not so sure. This was General Thimayya, now retired, who noted that",
  "therewerethreatsfrombothPakistanandChina.Wherethecountrywasmod-",
  "erately well placed to meet an attack from the former, Thimayya could not",
  "\u2018even as a soldier envisage India taking on China in an open conflict on its",
  "own. China\u2019s present strength in manpower, equipment and aircraft exceeds",
  "our resources a hundred fold with the full support of the USSR, and we could",
  "never hope to match China in the foreseeable future. It must be left to the",
  "politicians and the diplomats to ensure our security\u2019. The \u2018present strength of",
  "the army and air forces of India\u2019, said the general, \u2018are even below the \u201cmin-",
  "imum insurance\u201d we can give to our people\u2019.65",
  "The implications were clear: either the diplomats should seek a treaty",
  "deal with China, or the politicians should canvass for military help from the",
  "Western bloc. But the rising tide of patriotic sentiment ruled out the first; and",
  "the non-alignment of the prime minister, strengthened by the anti-American-",
  "ism of his defence minister, ruled out the second.",
  "In the third week of July 1962 there were clashes between Indian and",
  "Chinese troops in the Galwan valley of Ladakh. Then, in early September, a",
  "conflict arose over the Dhola/Thag La ridge, in the valley of the Namka Chu",
  "river, some sixty miles west of Tawang. The region was where the borders of",
  "India, Tibet and Bhutan all met; the exact alignment of the McMahon Line",
  "was in dispute here. The Indians claimed the ridge fell south of the Line; the",
  "Chinese argued that it was on their side.66",
  "It was back in June that a platoon of the Assam Rifles had established a",
  "post at Dhola, as part of the still continuing forward policy. On 8 September",
  "the Chinese placed a post of their own at Thag La, which overlooked (and",
  "threatened) Dhola. Peking and New Delhi exchanged angry letters. On the",
  "ground, Indian commanders were divided as to what todo. Some said that the",
  "Chinese must be shifted from Thag La. Others said that it would be too diffi-",
  "cult, since the terrain was disadvantageous to the Indians (Thag La lay some",
  "2,000feetaboveDhola).Meanwhile,atthesiteitself,theChinesetroopstookto addressing homilies in Hindi via a megaphone. \u2018Hindi-Chini bhai bhai\u2019,",

  "In the event it was the enemy who acted first. A phoney war, which had",
  "lasted all of three years, was made very real on the night of 19/20 October,",
  "whentheChinesesimultaneouslylaunchedaninvasioninboththeeasternand",
  "western sectors. The \u2018blitzkrieg\u2019 across the Himalaya had come, as \u2018Pragmat-",
  "ist\u2019 had predicted it would. And, as he had feared, the Indians were unpre-",
  "pared. That night, wrote the New York Times, a \u2018smouldering situation burst",
  "into flame\u2019 as \u2018heavy battles broke out in both of the disputed areas. Massesof Chinese troops under the cover of thunderous mortar fire drove the Indians",
  "back on each front\u2019. Both sides had built up forces on the border, but \u2018inde-",
  "pendent observers laid the onslaught to the Chinese\u2019. The Chinese attacked",
  "in waves, armed with medium machine guns backed by heavy mortars. Two",
  "Chinese divisions were involved in the invasion, these using five times as",
  "many troops as had the Indians.69",
  "The Indians were \u2018taken by surprise\u2019 as the Chinese quickly overran",
  "many positions, crossed the Namkha Chu valley and made for the monastery",
  "in Tawang. Another detachment made for the eastern part of NEFA. Chinese",
  "troops moved deeper and deeper into Indian territory. Eight posts were repor-",
  "tedtohavefalleninLadakh;almosttwentyinNEFA.Tawangitselfhadcome",
  "under the control of the Chinese.70",
  "The ease with which the Chinese took Indian positions should not have",
  "come as a surprise. Their troops had been on the Tibetan plateau in strength",
  "from the mid-1950s, fighting or preparing to fight Khampa rebels. Unlike the",
  "Indians, they were well used to battles in the high mountains. Besides, access",
  "was much easier from the Tibetan side, the relatively flat terrain conducive to",
  "roadbuildingandtroopmovement.Thegeographicaladvantagewasalltothe",
  "Chinese. From Assam up to the McMahon Line the climb was very steep, the",
  "hills covered with thick vegetation and the climate often damp and wet. The",
  "Indian forward posts were hopelessly ill equipped; with no proper roads, they",
  "\u2018lived from air-drop to air-drop\u2019, dependent on supplies and for survival on",
  "sorties by helicopters.71",
  "The Indian problems were compounded by a vacuum of leadership. On",
  "18 October General Kaul had come down with acute chest pains. He was",
  "evacuated to Delhi and his corps was left leaderless for five days, by which",
  "time Tawang had fallen.",
  "On 24 October the Chinese halted their advance, while Chou En-lai",

  "Nehru\u2019s speech might be read as a belated acknowledgement of the cor-",

  "was an extreme expression of nationalism, rather than its nullification. The",
  "debate that followed took a full week; 165 members spoke, apparently a re-",
  "cord.75",
  "Back on the borders, the lull in the fighting was broken by a second",
  "Chinese offensive on 15 November. A 500-mile front was attacked in NEFA.",
  "There was a bitter fight in Walong, where soldiers from the Dogra and Ku-",

  "among the Indian commanders. Where should they make their first, and per-",

  "general advocated Bomdi Lal, a good sixty miles to the south, where supplies",
  "couldbeeasilysentupfromplains.Finally,itwasdecidedtostoptheChinese",
  "advance at Se La, a mere fifteen miles from Tawang.",
  "The decision to make the stand at Se La was Kaul s. When he fell ill,",
  "his place had been taken by Lieutenant General Harbaksh Singh, a highly re-",
  "garded commander with much field experience. But before Singh could ad-",
  "equately reorganize the defences, Kaul had flown back from Delhi to resume",
  "charge once more.",
  "The Chinese had occupied Tawang on 25 October. When they halted",

  "Meanwhile, battles broke out north of Se La, the Chinese again with the ad-",
  "vantage. The garrison commander, in panic, ordered withdrawal, and his bri-",

  "had already skirted Se La and cut off the road behind them. Large sections",

  "ination. Now their compounds were \u2018besieged by thousands of would-be re-",
  "cruits\u2019. Some were labourers and factory hands; others, unemployed gradu-",
  "ates. They all hoped that in this emergency \u2018the army will lower its physical",
  "requirements and give them food and lodging and a purpose in life\u2019.80It seems unlikely that these men would have made a better showing than",
  "those who had already fought, and lost. In any case, they did not get the",
  "chance. Poised to enter the plains of Assam, the Chinese instead announced",
  "a unilateral ceasefire on 22 November. In NEFA they pulled back to north of",
  "the McMahon Line. In the Ladakh sector they likewise retreated to positions",
  "they had held before the present hostilities began.",
  "WhydidtheChinesepackupandgohome?Somethoughttheywerede-",

  "While the end of the war can be thus explained, its origins are harder to",
  "understand. There were no White Papers issued from the Chinese side, and",
  "their records are not open \u2013 and perhaps never will be. All one can say is that",
  "behindsuchacarefullyco-ordinatedattacktheremusthavebeenseveralyears",
  "of preparation. As for its precise timing, a speculation offered at the time and",
  "which still seems plausible was that the two superpowers, the Soviet Union",
  "and the United States, were preoccupied with the Cuban missile crisis, allow-",
  "ing Peking its little adventure without fear of reprisal.",
  "The border war had underlined Chinese superiority in \u2018arms, commu-",
  "nications, strategy, logistics, and planning\u2019.82 According to Defence Ministry",
  "statistics, 1,383 Indian soldiers had been killed, 3,968 were taken prisoner,",
  "while 1,696 were still missing.83 These losses were small by the standards of",
  "modern warfare, yet the war represented a massive defeat in the Indian ima-",
  "gination. Naturally, the search began for scapegoats. Over the years, a series",
  "of self-exculpatory memoirs were published by the generals in the field. Each",
  "soughttoshifttheblameawayfromhimselfandtowardsanothercommander,",
  "ortowardsthepoliticians whohadneglected their warningsandissuedorders",
  "that were impossible to carry out. In his own contribution to the genre, Major",
  "General D. K. Palit \u2013 director general of military operations at the time of the",
  "war notes that in these memoirs \u2018there are striking inconsistencies; each had",
  "his own wicket to defend\u2019. Then he adds: \u2018Hindsight tends to lend rationality",
  "to events that in fact are innocent of coherence or logical sequence.\u201984",
  "AmongtheIndianpublic,theprincipalsentimentwasthatofbetrayal,of",
  "being taken for a ride by an unscrupulous neighbour whom they had naively",
  "chosen to trust and support. In his letters to Chou En-lai, Nehru expressed",
  "these feelings as well as anyone else. But for the deeper origins of the disputeone must turn to his earlier writings, in particular to an interview in which he",
  "spoke not as India\u2019s leader but as a student of world history. Back in 1959,",
  "Nehru had told Edgar Snow that \u2018the basic reason for the Sino-Indian dispute",
  "was that they were both \u201cnew nations\u201d, in that both were newly independent",
  "and under dynamic nationalistic leaderships, and in a sense were \u201cmeeting\u201d",
  "at their frontiers for the first time in history\u2019. In the past, \u2018there were buffer",
  "zones between the two countries; both sides were remote from the borders\u2019.",
  "Now, however, \u2018they were meeting as modern nations on the borders\u2019. Hence",
  "it\u2018wasnaturalthatacertaindegreeofconflictshouldbegeneratedbeforethey",
  "can stabilize their frontiers\u2019.85",
  "The India-China conflict, then, was a clash of national myths, national",
  "egos, national insecurities and \u2013 ultimately and inevitably \u2013 national armies.",
  "In this sense, however unique (and uniquely disturbing) it must have seemed",
  "to Indians, it was very representative. For competing claims to territory have",
  "beenanalltoocommonsourceofconflictinthemodernworld.Nehru\u2019scom-",
  "ments to Edgar Snow said as much. However, let us give the last word to",
  "an unlikely authority, the beat poet Allen Ginsberg. In March 1962 Ginsberg",

  "Asian country which really stands in their way is India and pari passu",

  "In response to the Indian request, President Kennedy sanctioned the supply",
  "of a million rounds for machine guns, 40,000 land mines and 100,000 mortar",
  "rounds.4 This fell far short of the Grand Alliance that his ambassador was",
  "recommending; yet it was far in excess of what other Americans thought",
  "New Delhi deserved. A bitter opponent of arms supply to India was Senator",
  "Richard B. Russell of Georgia, the long-serving chairman of the Senate",
  "Armed Forces Committee. A crusty old reactionary \u2013 doughtily opposed to",
  "desegregation and the like \u2013 Russell had previously termed India an \u2018unreli-",
  "ablefriend\u2019andcalledNehrua\u2018demagogueandahypocrite\u2019.Nowhetoldthe",
  "AssociatedPressthathewas\u2018againstgivingIndiaanyofourmodernweapons",
  "for the principal reason that we would be just giving them to the Chinese",
  "Communists\u2019. The Indians, said the senator, had \u2018put on a disgraceful exhib-",
  "ition in permitting themselves to be driven out of what should have been im-",
  "pregnablestrongholdsinthebordermountains.Theyseemincapableoffight-",
  "ing and if we supply them with weapons they will just fall into the hands of",
  "the Communists\u2019. While he was at present opposed to giving \u2018one dime of",
  "weapons to India\u2019, Russell said he might have a rethink if India\u2019s old rulers,",
  "the British, were prepared to \u2018take over the matter of re-organizing and re-",
  "training their militaryforces\u2019.5",
  "Russell sremarks werewidely reported intheUnited States aswell asin",
  "India.Thestormofcorrespondencethatitgeneratedisauniqueprismthrough",
  "which one can view US\u2014India relations. One would expect the two coun-",
  "tries to have been allies, if only because both were large and culturally di-",
  "verse democracies. However, their relations had been clouded by suspicion",
  "on both sides suspicion of India\u2019s non-alignment on one side, and of Amer-",
  "ican military aid to Pakistan on the other. It did not help that these were both",
  "preachypeoples,whoseforeignpolicyanddiplomacywereinvariablyaccom-panied by an unctuous self-righteousness. Where democratic ideals sought to",
  "bring the two countries closer together, pride and patriotism pulled them fur-",
  "ther apart.",
  "Thus, while Kennedy and Galbraith might have deplored Senator Rus-",
  "sell\u2019s stand, he received much support from across Middle America. A cor-",
  "respondent from Wichita, Kansas, thanked the senator for warning that it was",
  "\u2018very dangerous for the US to make a doormat of itself to a country whose",
  "leaders have shown little interest or support to the US except to take our",
  "moneyandaidandthenvilifyusateveryturn\u2019.AladyfromLoomis,Califor-",
  "nia, agreed that \u2018nothing should be sent to that pro-Communist hypocrite and",
  "political actor Nehru and his Communist ministers\u2019. A man from Plantation,",
  "Florida, thought that India\u2019s troubles were \u2018of their own consequences and",
  "making\u2019; namely, the \u2018Neutralist Policy\u2019 which they followed even while \u2018the",
  "Communists have swallowed millions of people\u2019 the world over. An 85-year-",
  "old Democrat from South San Gabriel endorsed Russell\u2019s \u2018objection to this",
  "country saddling its taxpayers with the upkeep of four hundred million ignor-",
  "ant, starving people of India, whose leaders including Nehru and others are",
  "strikingly procommunist and hostile to our form of government . . . Nehru s",
  "so-called neutralism . . . should teach this nation to let India stew in its own",
  "superstitious and ignorant juices.\u2019",
  "From his compatriots, Senator Russell received dozens of letters of con-",
  "gratulation, but only one of dissent. This was written by a Fulbright scholar",
  "based in Madras, who said it was time to undo the American policy of arm-",

  "Senator Russell\u2019s remarks brought to the fore the mutual misunderstand-",
  "ings between Indians and Americans as they had been up to 1962 \u2013 and bey-",
  "ond. Behind these lay different perceptions of foreign policy and national in-",
  "terest, and also a certain incompatibility of cultures. The two peoples ate,",
  "drank, sang, dressed and thought differently. As an admirer in Jacksonville",
  "wrote to the Senator: \u2018This Nehru, technically Caucasian, politically nothing",
  "ofthe sort...Howcan there bea\u201cmeeting ofminds\u201d with aman whostands",
  "on his head?\u2019 The reference was to Jawaharlal Nehru\u2019s love of yoga, a form",
  "of therapy then completely alien to the American way of life.6",
  "III",
  "The defeat by China caused the prime minister a certain loss of face in the",
  "international arena. It also undermined his position at home. Criticism of his",
  "leadership grew more strident. In the summer of 1963 the Congress lost a",
  "series of important by-elections, which put into Parliament three opposition",
  "stalwarts: Minoo Masani, J. B. Kripalani and Rammanohar Lohia.",
  "In June 1963 Nehru held a press conference, his first in many months.",
  "The meeting lasted ninety minutes, and was notable for the anger the prime",
  "minister directed at the Chinese. He spoke of the \u2018dark spate of falsehoods",
  "emanatingfromPeking\u2019,andoftheir\u2018highrecordinvituperation\u2019.Explaining",
  "the war, and India\u2019s defeat therein, Nehru claimed that \u2018the Chinese are a",
  "military-minded nation, always laying stress on military roads and prepared-",
  "ness . . . Right from the beginning of the present regime there, they have con-",
  "centrated on the military apparatus being stronger. It is a continuation really",
  "of the past civil wars. So, they are normally strong.\u20197Nehru also said that in attacking him personally, the Chinese \u2018have",
  "something in common with some of our opposition leaders here\u2019. He then ad-",
  "ded, gratuitously: \u2018As for our opposition leaders, they have the habit of com-",
  "bining with anybody and everybody regardless of principle and a time may",
  "come when some of them may for the purpose combine with the Chinese\u2019.",
  "Soon,theoppositionleadersdidformallycombineamongthemselvestointro-",
  "ducea\u2018no-confidence\u2019motioninParliament,anactofdaringthatwouldhave",
  "been inconceivable at any time between August 1947 and November 1962.",
  "The Congress had the numbers to easily defeat the vote, but the debate lasted",
  "all of four days, during which a series of telling points were made against the",
  "prime minister, his party, and his government.8",
  "The criticisms in and out of Parliament prompted a serious rethink",
  "among the Congress leadership. Fifteen years in power had made the party",
  "complacent, somewhat out of touch with happenings on the ground \u2013 as evid-",
  "enced in the recent by-election defeats and the growing strength of regional",
  "parties like the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK). The chief minister of",
  "Madras,K.Kamaraj,washimselfmostthreatenedbytheDMK;now,tocheck",
  "its rise and stem the rot within, he recommended that senior Congress minis-",

  "he had once venerated: at a Congress session in Madras, where Nehru stood",
  "\u2018sprightly, slim and erect\u2019; at his home in Allahabad, where Nehru \u2018jumped",
  "two steps at a time, with me emulating him, as I followed him upstairs\u2019.10",
  "WhereIndianswouldnotspeculateopenlyaboutNehru\u2019sdeath,Western",
  "observers were under no such inhibition. In 1963 the American journalist",
  "Wells Hangen published a book with the title After Nehru, Who? This listed",
  "eight possible successors, each of whom was allotted a separate chapter. Six",
  "were from the Congress Party: Morarji Desai, V. K. Krishna Menon, Y. B.",
  "Chavan,LalBahadurShastri,S.K.Patilandthesolefemalecandidate,Indira",
  "Gandhi. A seventh possibility was the social worker and sometime social-ist revolutionary Jayaprakash Narayan. The last listed was a general \u2013 B. M.",
  "Kaul.11",
  "The question now being asked was not just \u2018After Nehru, Who?\u2019 , but",
  "also \u2018After Nehru, What?\u2019 Shortly after the publication of Hangen\u2019s book,",
  "a reporter from the Sunday Times of London spent several weeks travel-",
  "ling through India. He met the prime minister, to find that \u2018old Nehru has",
  "gone downhill so fast recently\u2019. The decay of the man mirrored the decay",
  "of his country. In contrast to the \u2018intensity and unfathomable ambition of a",
  "wild young China\u2019, India was a land of \u2018indescribable poverty\u2019 and a \u2018will-",
  "less Government\u2019. What would happen after Nehru passed on? The reporter",
  "thought that the battle \u2018will lie between the Communists and the new gener-",
  "ation of political bandits emerging in the States. . .\u2019 . A third contender was",
  "the army; thus far, the generals had stayed aloof from politics, but would they",
  "\u2018stand aside while India collapsed into disorder or was swept into Commun-",
  "ism\u2019?Suchweretheprospectsforthefuture;meanwhile,\u2018thefreeworldmust",

  "Contemporary photographs confirm that Nehru was in physical Decline",
  "\u2013 sunken shoulders, a tired, even doped look on his face, an unfamiliar bulge",
  "around his waist. In the first week of September 1963 Indira Gandhi wrote to",

  "Madurai, Chandigarh, Calcutta, Bihar and Bombay (twice).14",
  "One place that the prime minister could have gone to, but chose not to,",
  "was Nagaland. For a state of that name had finally come into existence on 1",
  "December 1963. In other circumstances Nehru would have been keen to in-",
  "augurate it himself. But the journey to Kohima was long and arduous, and",
  "perhaps he also remembered the hostile reception he had got there back in",

  "He collapsed on the stage and had to be helped to his feet and rushed back to",
  "Delhi. The diagnosis was that he had suffered a mild stroke. As one headline",

  "IV",
  "The China war had weakened Nehru\u2019s position not just in India or the world,",
  "but within the Congress Party itself. The locus of decision-making had now",
  "shifted from the prime minister\u2019s home to the Congress Parliamentary Party.",
  "Unlikeinthepast,Nehrucouldnolongergetthepartytoalwaysdohisbidding",
  "in matters big and small.17 For instance, he had not welcomed the Kamaraj",
  "plan, on the grounds that it would deplete his government of experience and",
  "talent.",
  "After his illness, Nehru was able to persuade the party to return Lal Ba-",
  "hadur Shastri to the Cabinet. Shastri was officially called \u2018minister without",
  "portfolio\u2019, but in fact functioned as the de facto deputy to the prime minister.",
  "The two shared a language, a home state and a history of being in the same",
  "jails at around the same time. Nehru trusted and liked Shastri, whose own",
  "quiet, understated personality was in such marked contrast to his own.",
  "The first assignment entrusted to Shastri pertained to the state of Jammu",
  "and Kashmir. On 27 December 1963 a major crisis had been sparked by the",
  "theft of a holy relic, a hair of the Prophet Mohammed, from the Hazratbal",
  "mosque in Srinagar. A week after it vanished, the relic mysteriously reap-",
  "peared in the mosque. No one knew how it came back, just as no one knew",
  "howithadvanishedinthefirstplace.Andnooneknewwhethertherelicnow",
  "in place was the genuine article, or a fake.",
  "Through the month of January there were protests and demonstrations",
  "in the Valley. The ripples spread through the Muslim world. In distant East",
  "Pakistan there were religious riots aimed at the minority Hindu community,",
  "hundreds of thousands of whom fled to India. Now there was the danger of",
  "retaliatory riots targeting Muslims in India itself.In the last week of January Nehru dispatched Lal Bahadur Shastri to",
  "Kashmir. After speaking to officials, and consulting local politicians, Shastri",
  "decided to hold a special showing, or deedar, to certify whether the returned",
  "relic was genuine. A panel of senior clerics was constituted to view the relic.",
  "They did so on 3 February, and to palpable relief all round decided that this",
  "was the real article. Calm returned to the Valley. To keep the peace going the",
  "government of India appointed, as chief minister, G. M. Sadiq, a politician",
  "known for his left-wing views, but also forhisintegrity.18",
  "The Hazratbal incident brought home, once more, the fact that trouble in",
  "Kashmir had its repercussions on life in the subcontinent as a whole. The Ch-",
  "ina fiasco had made Nehru more alert to the need to seek a final resolution of",
  "the Kashmir dispute. For India could not afford to have two hostile fronts. He",
  "was encouraged in this line of thinking by his old friend Lord Mountbatten.",
  "In April 1963 Mountbatten had told Nehru that \u2018if his glory had at one time,",
  "brought India credit\u2019 in the world, the country, and he, now had a \u2018tarnished",
  "image\u2019, principally owing to the failure to settle the question of Kashmir. The",
  "Englishman felt that this could be \u2018rectified\u2019 by a \u2018heroic gesture by India\u2019,",
  "such as the \u2018granting of independence to the [Kashmir] valley regardless of",
  "the Pakistani attitude\u2019.19",
  "In fact, during 1962 and 1963 there were several rounds of talks with",
  "Pakistan on the issues that divided the two countries. Here, the government",
  "of India was represented by the experienced Sardar Swaran Singh, while",
  "Pakistan was represented by the young and ambitious Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto.",
  "At these talks no one represented Kashmir. But, as the Hazratbal incident",
  "showed, it was not prudent to neglect the feelings of the people at the centre",
  "of the dispute. And who better to take their pulse than Sheikh Abdullah? By",
  "the end of 1963 Nehru was already thinking of releasing the Sheikh, who by",
  "this time had been in jail for ten years. The stroke at Bhubaneshwar, with its",
  "intimations of mortality, made him think further in this regard. Why not re-",
  "lease Abdullah and have a last shot at solving the Kashmir problem before he",
  "was gone?",
  "V",
  "SheikhAbdullah,wemayrecall,hadbeenarrestedbythegovernmentofIndia",
  "in August 1953. No charges were brought against him, but in January 1958",
  "he was suddenly released. He made his way to the Valley, where he met witha spectacular reception. He addressed well-attended public meetings in Srin-",
  "agar,includingoneattheHazratbalmosque.Thisseemstohaveunnervedhis",
  "enemies in the administration. Towards the end of April he was arrested once",
  "more. This time he was shifted to a jail in Jammu, and charged with plotting",
  "with Pakistan to break up India. He was accused, among other things, of at-",
  "tempting \u2018to facilitate wrongful annexation of the territories of the state by",
  "Pakistan; create communal ill-feeling and disharmony in the state and receive",
  "secret aid from Pakistan in the shape of money, bombs, etc.\u2019.20",
  "The charges were, to put it politely, trumped up. While the Sheikh con-",
  "templatedindependence,heneverwantedtojoinPakistan.Andwhiletheidea",
  "ofbeingtherulerofafreeKashmirappealedtohim,hesawashissubjectsall",
  "the people of the state, regardless of religion. As even his political opponents",
  "conceded, he had not a communal bone in his body.",
  "Speaking at his trial, the Sheikh said that he stood for a single objective:",
  "the right ofself-determination forthe people ofJammu andKashmir,who,he",
  "insisted,were\u2018notaflockofsheepandgoatstobedrivenbyforceonewayor",

  "state are the final arbiters of their fate\u2019 , significantly adding: \u2018He does not, I",
  "believe, deny this right to us even now.\u201921",
  "Two months after the Sheikh\u2019s first arrest, in 1953, Nehru had written",
  "that \u2018the mere fact of his detention is of course a matter which troubles",
  "me greatly\u2019.22 The months turned into years, deepening the guilt. One way",
  "of sublimating the guilt was to take a close interest in the education of his",
  "friend\u2019s children (which, by some accounts, he even helped pay for). In July",
  "1955 Nehru was visited by Abdullah\u2019s eldest son, Farooq, then studying in a",
  "medical college in Jaipur. Farooq told the prime minister that his classmates",
  "routinely referred to his father as a \u2018traitor\u2019. This prompted Nehru to write to",
  "a minister in the Rajasthan state government, asking him to ensure that the",
  "boy had \u2018proper living quarters and some friendly companionship\u2019, so that he",
  "did not develop any \u2018complexes and the like\u2019 . As Nehru put it, \u2018Some people",
  "foolishlyimaginethatbecausewehavehaddifferenceswithSheikhAbdullah,",
  "therefore we are not favourably inclined towards his son and his family. This,",
  "ofcourse,isnotonlyabsurdbutisjustthereverseofhowwefeel.Personally,",
  "becauseSheikhAbdullahisinprison,Ifeelratheraspecialresponsibilitythat",

  "matter of pain to the government, and particularly to the prime minister'.)24",
  "On the morning of 8 April the Sheikh stepped out of Jammu jail, a free",
  "man once more. He drove in an open car through the streets of the town, ac-",
  "cepting garlands and bouquets. The next day he gave his first public speech.",
  "According to a newspaper report, \u2018Sheikh Abdullah said the two pressing",
  "problems facing thesubcontinent \u2013communal strife andKashmir \u2013shouldbe",
  "solved during Prime Minister Nehru\u2019s lifetime. He described Mr Nehru as the",
  "last of the stalwarts who had worked with Gandhiji and said that after him a",
  "solution of these problems would become difficult.\u2019",
  "Nehru had invited Abdullah to come and stay with him in New Delhi.",
  "The Sheikh said he would first go to the Valley, consult his friends and sup-",
  "porters, and meet the Prime Minister after the Id festival (which fell on 23",
  "April).Onthe11thhesetoffbycartoSrinagar,ajourneythatnormallywould",
  "take a few hours. But the Sheikh travelled leisurely, stopping at towns and",
  "villages on the way. Wherever he halted, he also spoke. Thousands turned up",
  "to see and hear him, trudging miles from their own isolated hamlets. In these",
  "gatherings, women outnumbered men.",
  "In his speeches, Abdullah described his state as a bride cherished by two",
  "husbands \u2013 India and Pakistan \u2013 neither of whom \u2018cared to ascertain what the",
  "Kashmiris wanted\u2019. He said he would meet Jawaharlal Nehru with an open",
  "mind, and asked the Indians not to make up their minds beforehand either. As",
  "a journalist who interviewed him noted, the Sheikh had \u2018no personal bitter-",
  "ness, no rancour\u2019 \u2013 rather, he was imbued with \u2018a strong sense of mission\u2019, a",
  "compellingdesiretoseekasolutiontoKashmir.Atonemeetinghewasasked",
  "what he now felt about Nehru. Abdullah answered that he bore no ill will, for",
  "\u2018misunderstandings do occur even among brothers. I shall not forget the love",
  "Mr Nehru has showered onme in the past ...Iwill meet him as an old friend",
  "and comrade.\u2019",
  "On 18 April a week after he had left Jammu the Sheikh drove in an open",
  "jeep from Anantnag to the Kashmiri capital Srinagar. The thirty-mile route",
  "was lined by a \u2018near-hysterical crowd\u2019 of half a million people. The road was",
  "coveredwithfreshlypluckeddaisiesandtulipsandfestoonedwitharchesand",
  "bunting. When he finally entered the town, \u2018Srinagar\u2019s entire population . . .",
  "jammed the labyrinth of streets which were so richly decorated that even the",
  "sun did not penetrate the canopy of Kashmir silks, carpets and shawls\u2019.Meanwhile, back in Delhi, the prospect of talks between Nehru and Ab-",
  "dullah alarmed many members of the ruling Congress Party. Senior Cabin-",
  "et ministers issued statements insisting that the question of Kashmir was",
  "\u2018closed\u2019;thestatewas,andwouldstay,anintegralpartofIndia.Morecombat-",
  "ive still were members of the Jana Sangh. The party\u2019s general secretary, Deen",
  "DayalUpadhyaya,deploredtheSheikh\u2019srecentspeeches,whereheseemedto",
  "have \u2018questioned even the axiomatic facts of the Kashmir question\u2019 (such as",
  "itsfinalaccessiontoIndia).\u2018Insteadofstabilizingthepoliticalsituationofthe",
  "state\u2019, complained Upadhyaya, \u2018Sheikh Abdullah has tried to unsettle every",
  "issue.\u2019",
  "The opposition from the Hindu right was predictable. As it happens, the",
  "leftwasalsosuspiciousofAbdullahandhisintentions.TheCommunistParty",
  "thought he was in danger of falling into an \u2018imperialist trap\u2019, designed to de-",
  "tach Kashmir from India. Among the Indian political establishment, it seems,",
  "only Nehru\u2019s mind remained open. But he was to receive unexpected support",
  "from two old stalwarts who had also worked with Mahatma Gandhi. One was",
  "Jayaprakash Narayan, popularly known as \u2018JP\u2019, the former radical socialist",
  "who for the past decade had been a leading light of the Sarvodaya movement.",
  "JPwasanoldfriendoftheSheikh;hehadalsobeenavocaladvocateofbetter",
  "relationswithPakistan.In1962hehadsetupanIndia\u2014PakistanConciliation",
  "Group which, among other things, sought to find an \u2018equitable and honour-",
  "able\u2019 solution to the Kashmir dispute.25",
  "Now,welcomingSheikhAbdullah\u2019sreleaseinasignedarticleintheHin-",
  "dustanTimes,JPdeploredtheinsinuations against Abdullahbypoliticians in-",
  "sideandoutsidetheCongress.Thesehadthreatenedthathewouldbeputback",
  "in jail if he went \u2018too far\u2019. \u2018It is remarkable\u2019, commented JP acidly, \u2018how the",
  "freedom fighters of yesterday begin so easily to imitate the language of the",
  "imperialists.\u2019",
  "What alarmed politicians in Delhi was the Sheikh\u2019s talk about ascertain-",
  "ing afresh the wishes of the Kashmiri people. JP thought this eminently reas-",
  "onable, for the elections in Jammu and Kashmir in 1957 and 1962 were any-",
  "thing but free and fair. In any case, if India was \u2018so sure of the verdict of the",
  "people,whyarewesoopposedtogivingthemanotheropportunitytoreiterate",
  "it? A satisfactory settlement of the Kashmir question would greatly improve",
  "relationsbetweenIndiaandPakistan.JPhopedthattheleadersofIndiawould",
  "display \u2018the vision and statesmanship that this historic moment demands\u2019. He",
  "added, \u2018Happily, the one sane voice in the ruling party is that of the Prime",
  "Minister himself.\u201926More unexpected perhaps was the endorsement received by Nehru from",
  "C.Rajagopalachari(\u2018Rajaji\u2019),theveteranstatesmanwhohadoncebeenanin-",
  "timate associate of the prime minister but had latterly become apolitical op-",
  "ponent. As the founder of the Swatantra Party, Rajaji had savaged the prime",
  "minister\u2019seconomic policies. Thesecriticisms sometimes hadasharpperson-",
  "al edge. Now, to the surprise of his followers, he came out strongly in favour",
  "of Nehru\u2019s initiative in releasing Abdullah. Like JP, he deplored the threats to",
  "put the Sheikh back in jail, thus to \u2018force him into silence and submission\u2019.",
  "Fortunately, \u2018the Prime Minister may be ill but he preserves his balance, and",
  "has evidently refused to take any foolish step and degrade India\u2019.",
  "The freeing of Abdullah, argued Rajaji, should act as a prelude to allow-",
  "ing \u2018the people of Kashmir [to] exercise their human right to rule themselves",
  "as well as they can\u2019. Indeed, solving the Kashmir tangle would pave the way",
  "for a larger resolution of the Indo-Pak dispute itself. Thus, Rajaji wrote of the",
  "need to",
  "try and think fundamentally in the present crisis. Are we to yield to the",
  "fanatical emotions of our anti-Pakistan groups? Is there any hope for In-",
  "dia or for Pakistan, if we go on hating each other, suspecting each other,",
  "borrowing and building up armaments against each other \u2013 building our",
  "two houses, both of us on the sands of continued foreign aid against a",
  "future Kurukshetra? We shall surely ruin ourselves forever if we go on",
  "doing this . . . We shall be making all hopes of prosperity in the future",
  "a mere mirage if we continue this arms race based on an ancient grudge",
  "and the fears and suspicions flowing from it.27",
  "VI",
  "In Kashmir, meanwhile, Sheikh Abdullah was talking to his colleagues and",
  "associates. He discovered that while he had been in jail, he had come to be",
  "associated with the Pakistan party. At his trial Abdullah had insisted that he",
  "never expressed a desire for Kashmir to join Pakistan. India or independence",
  "\u2013thoseweretheonlytwooptionshehadcountenanced.Butthetrialproceed-",
  "ings never reached the common people of the Valley. They knew only that he",
  "was being tried for conspiracy against the Indian nation. Would not that make",
  "him, by default, a friend of Pakistan?Thecommonpeoplewerestrengthenedintheirbeliefsbythepropaganda",
  "of Bakshi Ghulam Mohammed\u2019s government, which had painted the Sheikh",
  "as an agitator for a plebiscite, and hence anti-Indian. Moreover, the chicanery",
  "and corruption of the Bakshi regime had greatly tarnished the image of India",
  "among the Kashmiris. Abdullah found that the pro-Pakistani elements were",
  "now perhaps in a majority. This did not please him. But, sensing the mood",
  "on the ground, he worked to gradually win over the people to his point of",
  "view. He met the influential priest Maulvi Farooqui and urged him to support",
  "a\u2018realistic\u2019solution,ratherthanclaimthatKashmirshouldaccedetoPakistan",
  "in pursuance of the two-nation theory.28",
  "On 23 April, two weeks after he was released, Sheikh Abdullah ad-",
  "dressed a prayer meeting in Srinagar. A solution to the Kashmir dispute,",
  "he said, must take into account its likely consequences for the 50 million",
  "MuslimsinIndia,andthe10millionHindusinEastPakistan.Threedayslater,",
  "in his last speech before leaving for Delhi, he urged the Kashmiris to main-",
  "tain communal peace, to thus set an example for both India and Pakistan. \u2018No",
  "Muslim in Kashmir will ever raise his hand against the minorities,\u2019 he pro-",
  "claimed.",
  "On28April,thedaybeforeAbdullahwasduetoarriveinDelhi,theJana",
  "Sangh held a large procession in the capital. The marchers shouted anti-Ab-",
  "dullahandanti-NehruslogansanddemandedthatthegovernmentofIndiaab-",
  "rogateArticle370anddeclareKashmirtobean\u2018integralandindivisible\u2019part",
  "of India. At a public meeting held the same day, A. B. Vajpayee demanded",
  "that the prime minister tell Abdullah that Jammu and Kashmir had \u2018already",
  "been integrated with the Indian Union and that there was no scope for discus-",
  "sion on this matter\u2019.",
  "On the 29th Abdullah flew into Palam airport with his principal associ-",
  "ates. The party drove on to Teen Murti House, where the prime minister was",
  "waiting to receive Abdullah. It was the first time the two men had seen one",
  "another since Nehru\u2019s government had locked up the Sheikh in August 1953.",
  "Now, as one eyewitness wrote, \u2018the two embraced each other warmly. They",
  "were meeting after 11 years, but the way they greeted each other reflected no",
  "traces of embarrassment, let aside bitterness over what happened in the inter-",
  "vening period\u2019. The duo posed for the battery of press photographers before",
  "going inside.",
  "This was a reconciliation between the leader of the nation and a man till",

  "to prominent non-political figures such as Jayaprakash Narayan. He placed a",
  "wreath on Gandhi\u2019s tomb in Rajghat and addressed a prayer meeting at Delhi",
  "s greatest mosque, the Jama Masjid.",
  "That Nehru was talking to Abdullah was not to the liking of the Jana",
  "Sangh. Notably, it also caused disquiet among members of his own Cabinet,",
  "who worried that the Kashmir question would now be \u2018re-opened\u2019. To pre-",
  "empt the possibility, a senior minister told Parliament that the \u2018maintenance",
  "of the status quo [in Kashmir] was in the best interests of the subcontinent\u2019",
  ".Andtwenty-sevenCongressMPsissuedastatementarguingthat\u2018youcanno",
  "moretalkofself-determinationinthecaseofKashmirthaninthecaseof,say,",
  "Bombay or Bihar\u2019.",
  "Within his party, the only senior man who appeared sympathetic to",
  "Nehru\u2019s efforts was Lal Bahadur Shastri. There were, however, some opposi-",
  "tion politicians who saw the point of speaking seriously with Abdullah. Thus",
  "the Swatantra Party leader Minoo Masani urgently wired Rajaji:",
  "Understand Nehru and Lal Bahadur endeavouring to find solution with",
  "Sheikh Abdullah but are up against confused thinking within Congress",
  "Party alongside of Jan Sangh communist combination. If you think tele-",
  "gram or letter to Jawaharlal from yourself encouraging him [to] do the",
  "right thing and assuring your personal support would help please move",
  "in the matter.29",

  "some kind of autonomous status. As he saw it, \u2018self-determination for Kash-",
  "mir is as far as we are concerned a lesser issue than the aim of reducing Indo-",
  "Pak jealousy\u2019. He thought that \u2018the idea that if we \u201clet Kashmir go\u201d, we shall",
  "be encouraging secessions everywhere is thoroughly baseless\u2019. \u2019I hope you",
  "and Jawaharlalji\u2019, wrote Rajaji to Shastri, \u2018will be guided by Providence and",
  "bring this great opportunity to a good result.\u201930Shortly after his release Abdullah had expressed his wish to \u2018pay my re-",
  "spects personally toRajaji, andhavethebenefit ofhismature advice\u2019.31Now,",
  "after his conversations with Nehru, he setoff south to meet the prime minis-",
  "ter\u2019s friend turned rival turned ally. He planned to stop at Wardha en route, to",
  "pay his respects to the Gandhian leader Vinoba Bhave. As he jokingly told a",
  "journalist, he would discuss \u2018spirituality with Vinoba and \u2018practical politics\u2019",
  "with Rajaji.",
  "On 4 May Lal Bahadur Shastri wrote to Rajaji urging him \u2018to suggest to",
  "Sheikh Saheb not to take any extreme line . . . Sheikh Saheb has just come",
  "out [of jail] and it would be good for him to give further thought to the dif-",
  "ferent aspects oftheKashmir question andcome toajudgement after fulland",
  "matureintrospectionanddeliberation.Itwillbemostunfortunateifthingsare",
  "done in a hurry or precipitated\u2019.32",
  "This was an airmail letter, but one does not know whether it reached",
  "Madras before the 5th, on which day Abdullah finally met Rajaji. They spoke",
  "forafullthreeandahalfhours,provokingthisfrontpageheadlineintheHin-",
  "dustan Times: \u2018Abdullah, CR, Evolve Kashmir Formula: Proposal to Be Dis-",
  "cussed with Prime Minister\u2019. Rajaji did not say a word to the press, but Ab-",
  "dullah was slightly more forthcoming. Speaking to the wise old man, he said,",
  "\u2018hadhelpedclearhismindaboutwhatwouldbethebestsolutionwhichwould",
  "remove this cancer from the body politic of India and Pakistan\u2019. Pressed for",
  "details, the Sheikh said these would have to await further talks with the prime",
  "minister. He did let on, however, that Rajaji and he had worked out \u2018an hon-",
  "ourable solution which would not give a sense of victory either to India or",
  "Pakistanandatthesametimewouldensureaplaceofhonourtothepeopleof",
  "Kashmir\u2019.",
  "While Abdullah was in Madras, word reached him that President Ayub",
  "Khan had invited him to visit Pakistan. On returning to Delhi on 6 May he",
  "went straight to Teen Murti House. He spent ninety minutes with Nehru, ap-",
  "prisinghimofwhatwasbeingreferredto,somewhatmysteriously,as\u2018theRa-",
  "jaji formula\u2019. The prime minister next directed Abdullah to an informal com-",
  "mitteeofadvisers.Thisconsistedoftheforeignsecretary,Y.D.Gundevia,the",
  "high commissioner to Pakistan, G. Parthasarathi, and the vice-chancellor of",
  "the Aligarh Muslim University, Badruddin Tyabji.",
  "Over two long days, Abdullah and the prime minister\u2019s men discussed",
  "the Kashmir issue threadbare. All kinds of alternatives were mooted. These",
  "included a plebiscite for the entire, undivided state of Jammu and Kashmir",
  "as it existed before 1947; the maintenance of the status quo; and afresh di-",
  "vision of the state, such that the Jammu and Ladakh regions went to India,Azad or northern Kashmir went to Pakistan, with a plebiscite being held in",
  "the Valley alone to decide its future. Abdullah told the officials that while",
  "they could work out the specifics of the solution, it must (1) promote Indo-",
  "Pakistani friendship; (2) not weaken the secular ideal of the Indian Constitu-",
  "tion; (3) not weaken the position of the minorities in either country. He asked",
  "them to give him more than one alternative, which he could take with him to",
  "Pakistan.",
  "The Sheikh\u2019s conditions more or less ruled out a plebiscite, the result",
  "of which, whatever it might be, would leave one country dissatisfied and",
  "minorities on both sides more vulnerable. What about the Rajaji formula?",
  "This, it appears, was for a condominium over Kashmir between India and",
  "Pakistan, with defence and external affairs being the joint responsibility of",
  "the two governments. (The model here was Andorra, a tiny but autonomous",
  "enclave whose security was guaranteed by its two large neighbours, France",
  "and Spain.) Another possibility was of creating a confederation among India,",
  "PakistanandKashmir.33",
  "ThetrinityadvisingNehruwereselectedfortheirabilityandknowledge;",
  "it is noteworthy nonetheless that they came from three different religious tra-",
  "ditions. It is noteworthy too that all were officials. Recall that when there was",
  "a chance to settle the dispute with China, the jingoism of the politicians com-",
  "pelled Nehru to take positions more hardline than he otherwise might have",
  "done. Now, in seeking a settlement with Pakistan, Nehru sought to work with",
  "hisofficials,ratherthanhisministers.Thewisdomofthisapproachwasmade",
  "clear in a letter written to Rajaji by the writer and parliamentarian B. Shiva",
  "Rao. This noted that",
  "ThereisaclearattemptbothfromwithintheCabinetandinParliamentto",
  "prevent the Prime Minister from coming to terms with Sheikh Abdullah",
  "if it should mean the reopening of the issue of accession. Many of these",
  "Ministershavemadepublicstatementswhilethediscussionsbetweenthe",
  "two are going on. It\u2019s a sign of the diminishing prestige and influence of",
  "the PM that they can take such liberties.",
  "This was interesting, but the reply was more interesting still. This gave more",
  "flesh to the \u2018Rajaji formula\u2019, while locating Nehru\u2019s predicament in proper",
  "perspective. Thus, wrote Rajaji,Asking Ayub Khan to give a commitment in advance about Azad Kash-",
  "mir now will break up the whole scheme. He will and cannot give it. He",
  "is in a worse situation than Nehru in regard to public pressures and emo-",
  "tional bondage . . . Any plan should therefore leave the prizes of war un-",
  "touched . . . Probably the best procedure is for Sheikh to concentrate on",
  "the valley leaving Jammu as a counterpoise to Azad Kashmir, to be pre-",
  "sumed to be integrated to India without question.",
  "This reduced shape of the problem is good enough, if solved as we",
  "desire, to bring about an improvement in the Indo-Pakistan relationship.",
  "And being of reduced size, would be a fitting subject for UN trusteeship",
  "partial or complete.34",
  "OntheIndianside,thebesthopeforpeacewasJawaharlalNehru.SheikhAb-",
  "dullah appears to have thought that Nehru was also the last hope. On 11 May",
  "the Sheikh told reporters that \u2018I do not want to plead for Nehru but he is the",
  "symbol of India in spite of his weakness. You cannot find another man like",
  "him.\u2019Headdedthat\u2018afterNehruhedidnotseeanyoneelsetackling[theprob-",
  "lems] with the same breadth of vision\u2019.",
  "For his part, Nehru was also quite prepared to give his old comrade and",
  "sometime adversary a sterling certificate of character. Speaking to the All-In-",
  "dia Congress Committee in Bombay on the 16th, the prime minister said that",
  "the Sheikh was wedded to the principles of secularism. Nor did he believe in",
  "the two-nation theory. Both Nehru and he hoped that \u2018it would be possible",
  "for India, holding on to her principles, to live in peace and friendship with",
  "Pakistan and thus incidentally to put an end to the question of Kashmir\u2019. \u2018I",
  "cannot say if we will succeed in this\u2019, said the prime minister, \u2018but it is clear",
  "that unless we succeed India will carry the burden of conflict with Pakistan",
  "with all that this implies.\u2019",
  "VII",
  "On 20 May, Sheikh Abdullah returned to Delhi, to stay at Teen Murti House",
  "and have a final round of talks with Nehru before travelling to Pakistan. At",
  "a press conference on the 22nd, Nehru declined to disclose the details, say-",
  "ingthat hedidnotwanttoprejudice theSheikh\u2019smission. Buthedidindicate",
  "that his government was \u2018prepared to have an agreement with Pakistan on the",
  "basis of their holding on to that part of Kashmir occupied by them\u2019.35Nehru\u2019s own papers on this subject are closed to scholars, but a letter",
  "written by his foreign secretary gives a clue to his thinking at the time. The",
  "prime minister had apparently asked legal experts to explore the implications",
  "of a confederation between India, Pakistan and Kashmir, \u2018as a possible solu-",
  "tion to our present troubles\u2019. Such an arrangement would not imply an \u2018an-",
  "nulment\u2019 of Partition. India and Pakistan would remain separate, sovereign",
  "states. Kashmir would be part of the confederation, with its exact status to be",
  "determined by dialogue. There might be a customs union of the three units,",
  "someformoffinancialintegrationandspecialprovisionsfortheprotectionof",
  "minorities.36",
  "To keep the discussion going, India was prepared to concede Pakistan\u2019 s",
  "hold over Azad Kashmir and Gilgit, the two parts of the state that it had lost",
  "in the war of 1947-8. Would Pakistan concede anything in turn? As Abdullah",
  "preparedtodepartforRawalpindi,MinooMasaniwrotetoA.K.Brohi,some-",
  "time Pakistani highcommissioner toIndia andnowaleading Karachi lawyer,",
  "a certified member of the Pakistani Establishment who had the ear of Presid-",

  "fluence in strengthening or weakening the hands of those who stand for Indo-",
  "Pakistan amity here\u2019. Nehru\u2019s Pakistan initiative was bitterly opposed from",
  "within his party and outside it. For it to make progress, for there to be a sum-",
  "mit meeting between the prime minister and President Ayub Khan, it was \u2018of",
  "the highest moment that Sheikh Abdullah should come back with something",
  "onwhichfuturetalkscouldbebased\u2019.MasaniurgedBrohitousehisinfluence",
  "with Ayub and other leaders, so that their talks with Abdullah might \u2018yield",
  "fruitful results in the interests of both countries\u2019.37",
  "Meanwhile, Abdullah proceeded to Pakistan. He hoped to spend two",
  "weeks in that country, beginning with the capital, Rawalpindi, moving on to",
  "AzadKashmirandendingwithEastPakistan,whereheintended,amongother",
  "things, to check on the feelings of the Hindu minority. On 24 May he touched",
  "down in Rawalpindi to a tumultuous reception. He drove in an open car from",
  "the airport to the town, the route lined by thousands of cheering Pakistanis.",
  "The welcome, said one reporter, \u2018surpassed in intensity and depth that given",
  "to Mr Chou En-lai in February\u2019.38",
  "Later, talking to newsmen, Abdullah called his visit \u2018a peace mission of",
  "an exploratory nature\u2019. He appealed to the press to help cultivate friendship",
  "between India and Pakistan. \u2018He said he had come to the definite conclusion",
  "that the armed forces of both the countries facing each other on the ceasefire",
  "line must be disengaged and that the edifice of a happy and prosperous Kash-mir could be built only on permanent friendship between India and Pakistan\u2019.",
  "AsinNewDelhi,heretooheemphasizedthatanysolutiontothedisputemust",
  "not foster a sense of defeat for either India or Pakistan; must not weaken In-",
  "dia\u2019s secularism or the future of its 60 million Muslims; and must satisfy the",
  "aspirations of the Kashmiris themselves.",
  "Thenextday,the25th,AbdullahandAyubKhanheldathree-hourmeet-",
  "ing. The Sheikh would not touch on the details, saying only that he found",
  "in Rawalpindi \u2018the same encouraging response as in Delhi. There is an equal",
  "keenness on both sides to come to a real understanding\u2019.",
  "Later that day Abdullah addressed a mammoth public meeting in",
  "Rawalpindi. He was \u2018cheered repeatedly as he spoke for two hours, bluntly",
  "warning both Indians and Pakistanis from committing wrongs which would",
  "endanger the lives of the minorities in both countries\u2019. The time had come,",
  "said Abdullah, for India and Pakistan to bury the hatchet. For if \u2018the present",
  "phase of tension, distrust and misunderstanding continued, both countries",
  "would suffer and their freedom be imperilled\u2019.",
  "Onthe26thAbdullahmetAyubKhanagain,forfourhoursthistime,and",
  "cameoutbeaming.ThePakistanipresident,hetoldacrowdednewsconferen-",

  "The meeting would take place in Delhi, and Abdullah would also be in the",
  "city, available for consultation. \u2018Of all the irritants that cause tension between",
  "India and Pakistan\u2019, said the Sheikh, \u2018Kashmir is the most important. Once",
  "thisgreatirritantisremoved,thesolutionofotherproblemswouldnotpresent",
  "much difficulty.\u2019",
  "By this time the enchantment with the Sheikh was wearing thin among",
  "the Pakistani elite. Their representative voice, the Dawn newspaper, wrote of",
  "howAbdullah\u2019sstatements,\u2018especiallyhisreferencestoIndia\u2019sso-calledsec-",
  "ularism, have caused a certain amount of disappointment among the public",
  "in general and the intelligentsia in particular\u2019. Dawn thought that the Sheikh",
  "had been \u2018lured by the outward show of Indian secularism, obviously forget-",
  "ting the inhumane treatment meted out to 60 million Muslims in the so-called",
  "secular state\u2019. But the newspaper had amore fundamental complaint, that Ab-",
  "dullah had \u2018taken up the role of an apostle of peace and friendship between",
  "PakistanandIndia,ratherthanthatoftheleaderofKashmir,whoseprimeob-",
  "jective should be to seek their freedom from Indian bondage\u2019.39",
  "Onthe27thAbdullahproceededtoMuzaffarabad,atownhehadnotseen",

  "out, news reached him that, back in New Delhi, Nehru had died. Abdullah atonce \u2018broke into tears and sobbed\u2019. In a muffled voice he told the reporters",
  "gathered around him, \u2018he is dead, I can t meet him\u2019. When asked for more re-",
  "actions he retired to a room, to be alone with his grief.",
  "Abdullah drove down to Rawalpindi and got on the first flight to Delhi.",
  "When he reached Teen Murti and saw the body of Nehru, \u2018he cried like a",
  "child\u2019. It took him some time to \u2018compose himself and place the wreath on",
  "the body of his old friend and comrade\u2019. To this account of a newsman on the",
  "spot we must add the witness of a diplomat who accompanied Nehru\u2019s body",
  "to the cremation ground. As the fire was burning the body to ashes, buglers",

  "The question remains how serious were the three campaigners for peace",
  "in April\u2014May 1964? The one who did not reveal his mind at all, at least not",
  "in the public domain, was Field Marshal Ayub Khan. We know nothing about",
  "what he really thought at the time, whether he was indeed serious about a ne-",
  "gotiated settlement on Kashmir, and whether he could then, so to say, \u2018sell\u2019",
  "an agreement with India to his people. Sheikh Abdullah, on the other hand,",
  "wasforthcomingwithhisviews,expressingthemtothepressandincountless",
  "public meetings and orations. Some thought his words a mere mask for per-",
  "sonal ambition. Writing in the Economic Weekly, one commentator claimed",
  "that \u2018even a superficial study of his political behaviour convinces [one] that",
  "he is embarked on a most ramified plan to win an independent State by skil-",
  "fully exploiting the hates and the prejudices, conscious and unconscious, andthepowerpoliticaltangleswhichprovidethebackgroundtoIndo-Pakistanre-",
  "lations\u2019.42",
  "This seems to me to be too cynical by far. For Abdullah\u2019s words, and",
  "still more his actions, make manifest his commitment to secularism, his con-",
  "cernfortheminoritiesinbothIndiaandPakistan.Hewasambitious,certainly,",
  "but while in 1953 he seems to have fancied himself as the uncrowned king",
  "of Kashmir, in 1964 he saw himself rather as an exalted peacemaker, the one",
  "manwhocouldbringtranquillityandprosperitytoapooranddividedsubcon-",
  "tinent.",
  "About Jawaharlal Nehru\u2019s motives there should be no doubt at all. He",
  "felt guilty about Abdullah\u2019s long incarceration, worried about the continuing",
  "disaffection in Kashmir, sensible of the long-term costs of the dispute to both",
  "India and Pakistan. The question was not then ofhis motives, but ofhis influ-",

  "help from Abdullah, actually worked out a settlement, would it have passed",
  "muster with the Congress Party, or the Indian Parliament?",
  "Possibly not. But even if it did, would it have worked in the long run?",
  "The legal expert consulted by Nehru\u2019s office on the idea of a confederation",
  "delicately pointed out that \u2018historically, confederations have been dominated",
  "by one member or united under stress\u2019.43 In sheer size India swamped both",

  "O 27 May 1964, as the news of Jawaharlal Nehru\u2019s death",
  "N THE AFTERNOON OF",
  "spread through New Delhi, one of the people it reached was an American",
  "graduate student named Granville Austin. Austin was writing a thesis on the",
  "making of the Indian Constitution, and thus had a more than ordinary interest",
  "inwhatNehrustoodfor.HemadehiswaytoTeenMurtiHouse,theretojoinan",

  "derly and not noisy\u2019, as diplomats and ministers were ushered in by the prime",
  "minister\u2019s staff. Among the VIPs was Dr Syed Mahmud, a veteran freedom",
  "fighter who had been with Nehru at Cambridge and in jail. Like the others, he",
  "hadtodisembarkfromhiscarandwalkupthesteeplyslopinglawnthatfronted",
  "the prime minister\u2019s residence. Austin saw a weeping Mahmud given a help-",
  "inghandbyJagjivanRam,aseniorCongresspoliticianandCabinetministerof",
  "low-caste origin. This was truly \u2018a scene symbolic of Nehru\u2019s India: a Muslim",
  "aided by an Untouchable coming to the home of a caste Hindu\u2019.1",
  "Between them, Muslims and Untouchables constituted a quarter of the",
  "population in free India. Before 1947, two leaders had most seriously chal-",
  "lenged the Congress\u2019s claims to represent all of India. One was a Muslim, M.",
  "A.Jinnah,whoarguedthatthepartyofGandhiandNehrurepresentedonlythe",
  "Hindus. The other was a former Untouchable, B. R. Ambedkar, who added the",
  "devastating rider that the Congress did not represent all Hindus, but only the",
  "upper castes among them.",
  "These claims were stoutly resisted. Gandhi himself had struggled against",
  "untouchability from long before Ambedkar had entered politics. And he had",
  "givenhislifeinthecauseofHindu\u2014Muslimharmony.FortheMahatma,swa-",
  "raj (freedom) would have meaning only if it came to all Indians, regardless of",
  "caste or creed (or gender).ThesewerecommitmentsJawaharlalNehrusharedwithGandhi.Inother",
  "matters, he might have been a somewhat wayward disciple. With his fellow",
  "intellectualshechosetotakeIndiadowntheroadofindustrialmodernization,",
  "rather than nurture a village-centred economy (as Gandhi would have",
  "wanted). But when it came to preserving the rights of minorities he stood",
  "shoulder-to-shoulder with the Mahatma. His was likewise a nationalism that",
  "was both composite as well as egalitarian.",
  "Inspired by Gandhi, and guided by Nehru, the Indian Constitution both",
  "abolished untouchability and proclaimed the state neutral in matters of reli-",
  "gion. Such was the law; how was the practice? Among all the tests faced by",
  "the new state this, perhaps, was the sternest. Since Hindus were both in a nu-",
  "merical majority and in positions of political pre-eminence, the idea of India",
  "would stand scrutiny only if they respected the rights and liberties of Indians",
  "different from themselves.",
  "II",
  "The idea of Pakistan had as its justification the need for minorities to be free",
  "of the fear of Hindu domination. Paradoxically, though, the state of Pakistan",
  "was created out of Muslim majority areas where this problem did not exist in",
  "the first place.",
  "After 1947 there were large populations of Muslims scattered all over",
  "peninsular India \u2013 as they had been before that date. Several million Muslims",
  "migrated across the borders to East and West Pakistan, but many more than",
  "this elected to stay behind in India. The creation of Pakistan had made their",
  "positiondeeplyvulnerable.Thiswastheview,ironically,oftwomenwhohad",
  "played critical roles in the making of Pakistan: the Bengali Muslim Leaguer",

  "Partition\u2013SuhrawardywrotetoKhaliquzzamaninhorrorthat\u2018theMuslimsin",
  "the Indian Union have been left high and dry\u2019. The antagonism caused by the",
  "formation of Pakistan had been heightened by the flight into India of Hindu",
  "and Sikh refugees. Suhrawardy now feared that \u2018there may be a general con-",
  "flagration which can well destroy the Muslim minority in the Indian Union\u2019.",
  "As for Khaliquzzaman, he had reached the melancholy conclusion that \u2018the",
  "partition of India [had] proved positively injurious to the Muslims of India,",
  "and on along-term basis for Muslims everywhere\u2019.To protect their interests and their lives \u2013 Suhrawardy drafted \u2018a de-",
  "claration of co-operation and mutual assistance between the two Dominions\u2019,",
  "committing both to protecting their minorities and to not making provocative",
  "statements against each other. Suhrawardy got Gandhi to endorse the declara-",
  "tion, but failed to get Jinnah to consent, despite begging him to doso, \u2018forthe",
  "sake of the helpless and hapless Muslims of the Indian Union\u2019.2",
  "Aswehaveseen,thecreationofPakistanprovidedafilliptotheforcesof",
  "Hindu communalism. The RSS and its ilk could now argue that the Muslims",
  "werebetrayerswhohaddividedthenation.IntheviewoftheextremistHindu,",
  "these Muslims should either go to Pakistan or face the consequences. The",
  "RSS grew in strength immediately after Partition, and although the murder of",
  "Gandhi in January 1948 stemmed its rise, the organization continued to exer-",
  "cise considerable influence in northern and western India.",
  "Truth be told, there were chauvinists within the ruling Congress itself,",
  "men who were not completely convinced of the loyalty of Muslims to the",
  "new nation. Some were in positions of high authority. The governor of Bihar",
  "warned the owners of the great steel mill in Jamshed-pur that their Muslim",
  "employees would leave for Pakistan, but destroy the machinery before going.",

  "The deep insecurity of the Indian Muslim was foregrounded in a survey",
  "conducted by an American psychologist in 1950. His Muslim interviewees \u2013",
  "who were from towns in north and west India \u2013 were beset by fear and suspi-",
  "cion. \u2018We are regarded as Pakistani spies\u2019, said one. \u2018It is dangerous to live in",

  "III",
  "Among those who did not wholly trust the Muslims was Vallabhbhai Patel,",
  "Home Minister of India. Patel remembered that the majority of Muslims had",
  "voted for the League in 1946, even in areas which would not form part of",
  "Pakistan. After the two states were created he remained suspicious of those",
  "who had stayed behind. In a speech at Lucknow in early January 1948 he re-minded his audience that it was in that town that \u2018the foundation of the two-",
  "nation theory was laid\u2019. For it was the UP intellectuals who had claimed that",
  "\u2018Muslimswereaseparatenation\u2019.Now,forthosewhohadchosennottogoto",
  "Pakistan, it was not enough to give \u2019mere declarations of loyalty to the Indian",
  "Union , they \u2018must give practical proof of their declarations\u2019.5",
  "Later that year, the secretary of Patel\u2019s Home Ministry wrote to the sec-",
  "retaries of all other departments, drawing their attention",
  "to one aspect of security which has assumed urgency and importance in",
  "thepresentcontextofrelationswithPakistan.Thereisgrowingevidence",
  "that a section of Muslims in India is out of sympathy with the Govern-",
  "ment of India, particularly because of its policy regarding Kashmir and",
  "Hyderabad, and is actively sympathetic to Pakistan. Such Government",
  "servantsarelikelytobeusefulchannelsofinformationandwouldbepar-",
  "ticularly susceptible to the influence of their relatives.",
  "It is probable that among Muslim employees of Government there are",
  "some who belong to these categories. It is obvious that they constitute",
  "a dangerous element in the fabric of administration; and it is essential",
  "that they should not be entrusted with any confidential or secret work or",
  "allowed to hold key posts. For this purpose I would request you to pre-",
  "pare lists of Muslim employees in your Ministry and in the offices under",
  "yourcontrol,whoseloyaltytotheDominionofIndiaissuspectedorwho",
  "arelikelytoconstituteathreattosecurity.Theselistsshouldbecarefully",
  "preparedandscrutinisedbytheHeadsofDepartmentsorotherhigherau-",
  "thority,andshouldbeusedforthespecificpurposesofexcludingpersons",
  "from holding key posts or handling confidential or secret work.",
  "I need scarcely add that I am sure you will see that there is no witch",
  "hunting; and that only genuine cases are included in the lists. Those who",
  "are loyal and whose work is satisfactory should of course be given every",
  "cause to feel that their claims are no less than those of men belonging to",
  "the majoritycommunity.6",
  "This was an extraordinary letter, which sparked, if not a witch-hunt, an ener-",
  "getic attempt to seek out traces of disloyalty among the Muslim employees of",
  "the government of India. Consider the case of the Archaeological Survey of",
  "India(ASI),whichhadnumerousMuslimemployees,theseentrustedwiththe",

  "dia, and those \u2018likely to constitute a danger to security\u2019. The circle heads then",
  "commenced secret investigations among their staff, the results of which were",
  "communicated back to headquarters. Half a century later, their reports make",
  "for interesting and in some cases chilling reading.",
  "Severalheadswrotebacksayingthattheydidnotpersonallydistrustany",
  "of their employees. However, they were pressured to transfer those likely to",
  "be in a position of vulnerability. The major of an infantry unit in Bijapur had",

  "liable\u2019; he, apparently, had relatives in Hyderabad, a state which was refusing",
  "to join the Union. The custodian was then transferred to the Kanheri Caves in",
  "Bombay.",
  "The most detailed report came from the superintendent of the northern",
  "circle,headquarteredinAgra,andwhichhadwithinitspurviewtheTajMahal",

  "Agra Fort, with a brother, son and mother in Hyderabad (Sindh); another a",
  "watchmanattheTajMahalwithawifeinKarachi.AnotherTajwatchmanhad",
  "two sons and a daughter in Karachi. The superintendent listed another seven",
  "employees who \u2018do not seem mischievous by nature, but may prove a useful",
  "channel for communicating information under the influence of their relations",
  "in Pakistan\u2019.",
  "On 20 October the home secretary sent a follow-up letter, targeting offi-",
  "cialswhohadcloserelativesinPakistan.Nowthatseveralmonthshadpassed",
  "since Partition, he said, \u2018there was no longer any reason [for] Government",

  "the strained relations between the two Dominions that would be prima facie",
  "evidence ofdisloyalty totheDominion ofIndia\u2019.Employees withfamilies in",
  "Pakistan would have to bring them back within a month. The Home Ministry",
  "askedforlistsofdelinquents;itwouldthendecide,casebycase,whether\u2018the",
  "interests of the country\u2019 required disciplinary action against them.",
  "Once more, the home secretary\u2019s instructions were passed on by the dir-",
  "ector general of the ASI to all his circle heads. Once more, the most detailed",
  "report came from the superintendent of the Agra circle, who did seem to re-",
  "gardthis,withsomerelish,asasortofwitch-hunt.Hisirewasreservedpartic-",
  "ularly for the khadims, or hereditary watchmen, of the Taj Mahal, eighteen in",
  "all, whose posts were created by Emperor Shah Jahan in the seventeenth cen-tury,andlater confirmed bythe British. Inthe eyes ofthe superintendent they",
  "seemed all to be enemy agents, \u2018unwilling to tell the whole truth about them-",
  "selves\u2019. At least six still had families in Pakistan. One khadim had overstayed",
  "with his relatives across the border; he had been suspended, and ordered to",
  "\u2018handoverbothsummerandwinterliveriesandallotherGovernmentarticles",
  "in his possession\u2019. The superintendent wanted to suspend a second khadim,",
  "whomhesuspectedofwantingonlytosellhispropertyinAgrabeforemigrat-",
  "ing \u2018to Pakistan surreptitiously\u2019. He had also targeted a third, who \u2018appears to",
  "have made efforts though not energetic enough to bring back the members of",
  "his family to India\u2019.",
  "Agra lay in the United Provinces, whose Muslims were very deeply di-",
  "vided indeed. The Muslims of the Punjab had migrated en masse across the",
  "border. From Bombay and the south, many intellectuals had voluntarily mi-",
  "gratedtoPakistan,buttheworking-classMuslimshadstayedbehind.Pakistan",
  "was too far and too alien for them to consider making a new life in a new",
  "place. However, the UP Mussalman spoke Urdu \u2013 the official language of",
  "Pakistan \u2013 and also lived close enough to be able to jump aboard a train and",
  "go there. Many went; many others stayed where they were.",
  "Almost every Muslim family in the UP was divided, and the employees",
  "oftheASIwerenoexception.ThesuperintendentoftheAgracircle,however,",
  "had no sympathy for employees with kin in what he considered \u2018enemy\u2019 ter-",
  "ritory. Bring them back, he told his subordinates, or face the consequences.",
  "A khadim named Shamsuddin had excited his boss\u2019s suspicion by selling his",
  "housewhenhisentire family wasinPakistan. Inasomewhat pathetic petition",
  "dated 8 December 1948, Shamsuddin said that he had \u2018not the least idea of",
  "ever going to Pakistan\u2019. There were four reasons why he had disposed of his",
  "house:(1)topaybackadebtheowedhisrelatives;(2)as\u2018mydaughtersareto",
  "bemarried,andIhavetoinvestmoneyinthispeon\u2019sdutyofmine\u2019;(3)asthe",

  "best to sell it before its condition further deteriorated; (4) as \u2018I have to make",
  "arrangementsforthelastceremoniesofmylifeasmysonshavedesertedme\u2019.",
  "The superintendent was not convinced, demanding more positive proof",
  "of Shamsuddin\u2019s loyalty to the Union of India. A note of 13 June 1949 tells",
  "us that the khadim had travelled to Pakistan, and brought back with him his",
  "twounmarrieddaughters,andtwograndchildrenofadeceaseddaughter\u2018over",
  "whom he could exercise control\u2019.7",
  "Were the records of the government of India ever to be thrown open",

  "Itisnotclearwhethertheprimeministerapprovedoftheattemptstoascertain",

  "aconstitutional obligation tomake all its citizens, butthe Muslims especially,",
  "feel secure.",
  "Nehru expressed these views both to Patel and in a series of letters he",
  "wrote to the chief ministers of various provinces.10 Three months after Parti-",
  "tion he reminded them that",
  "wehaveaMuslimminoritywhoaresolargeinnumbersthattheycannot,",
  "even if they want, go anywhere else. That is a basic fact about which",
  "there can be no argument. Whatever the provocation from Pakistan and",
  "whatever the indignities and horrors inflicted on non-Muslims there, we",
  "have got to deal with this minority in a civilized manner. We must give",
  "them security and the rights of citizens in a democratic State. If we fail",
  "to do so, we shall have a festering sore which will eventually poison the",
  "whole body politic and probably destroy it.",
  "Later in the same letter, he drew attention to \u2018the paramount importance of",
  "preserving the public services from the virus of communal politics\u2019.11",
  "This was a subject to which Nehru had necessarily to return. One pro-",
  "vocation was quarrels about property, for in some places Muslims were beingaskedbyover-energeticofficerstogiveuptheirhomesinfavourofHinduand",
  "Sikh refugees. The prime minister used the occasion of Gandhi\u2019s birthday to",
  "warn against \u2018creating an atmosphere of uncertainty and lack of security in",
  "the minds of large numbers of our Muslim fellow-countrymen\u2019. For this had",
  "\u2018far-reaching consequences not only in India but also in Kashmir. It affects",
  "our reputation abroad. A few houses or shops attached or taken possession of",
  "do not make very much difference. But, if wrongly done, they do affect our",
  "reputation and thus injure us.\u2019",
  "The prime minister acknowledged that \u2018Pakistan is pursuing a policy of",
  "utter callousness in this matter\u2019. However, he insisted that \u2018we cannot copy",
  "the methods or the ideals of Pakistan. They have declared themselves openly",
  "to be an Islamic State believing in the two-nation theory. We reject the the-",
  "ory and call ourselves a secular State giving full protection to all religions.",
  "Wehavetoliveuptoouridealsanddeclarations.Moreespeciallyonthisday,",
  "Gandhi Jayanti, it is for us to remember what Gandhiji taught us and what he",
  "died for.\u201912",
  "Nehru had made communal organizations his principal target during the",
  "election campaign of 1951\u20132. That election was fought and won on the plank",
  "of not making India a \u2018Hindu Pakistan\u2019. However, Nehru continued to be",
  "worried about the rights of those Indians whose culture and faith demarcated",
  "them from the majority. A particular concern was the very low proportion of",
  "Muslims in positions of authority. There were hardly any Muslim officers left",
  "in the defence services, and not very many in the secretariat. This, he sensed,",
  "was the consequence of a failure in creating a proper \u2019sense of partnership in",
  "every group and individual in the country, a sense of being a full sharer in the",
  "benefitsandopportunitiesthatareoffered\u2019.IfIndiawastobe\u2018asecular,stable",

  "The acknowledged political leader of the Muslims left behind in the Indian",
  "UnionwasMaulanaAbulKalamAzad.UnlikehisgreatrivalMohammadAli",
  "Jinnah, Azad believed that non-Hindus could live with peace and honour in a",
  "united India. In Nehru\u2019s characteristically eloquent formulation, Maulana Az-",
  "ad was \u2018a peculiar and very special representative in a high degree of thatgreat composite culture which has gradually grown in India\u2019. He embodied",
  "that\u2018synthesisofvariouscultureswhichhavecomeoneafteranothertoIndia,",
  "rivers that have flowed in and lost themselves in the ocean of Indian life\u2019.14",
  "Azad was deeply damaged by Partition. Seeing it as the failure of his",
  "life\u2019smission,heretreatedfromtheworldofpartypolitics(thoughinanycase",
  "his orientation was always more of the scholar than that of the mass leader).",
  "He served as education minister in the Union Cabinet, and in that capacity",

  "music and art. His age and temperament, however, confined him for the most",
  "part to Delhi.",
  "A younger member of the Congress Party seeking amore active political",
  "role was Saif Tyabji, scion of a famous nationalist family. Grandson of an",
  "early president of the Congress, and himself an engineer educated at Cam-",
  "bridge,TyabjiwaswellplacedtobeamodernistbridgebetweentheCongress",
  "and the Muslim masses. In 1955 he wrote a series of essays in the influential",
  "UrdunewspaperInqilab,theselaterpublishedinEnglishtranslationunderthe",
  "title The Future of Muslims in India. In the 1952 election Muslims had voted",
  "in large numbers for the Congress, a party which, under Nehru\u2019s leadership,",
  "they felt they could trust more than its rivals.15 Tyabji, however, felt that the",
  "Muslims should do more than vote for India\u2019s dominant party \u2013 they should",
  "join it, and influence its policies.",
  "Saif Tyabji pointed out that the Congress was a democratic institution,",
  "with its national council made up of elected representatives sent from the",
  "states, these in turn chosen from district and taluk committees. All it cost to",
  "become a member of the Congress was a subscription fee of four annas (a",
  "quarter of a rupee). Spread out across India, the Muslims could enrol in num-",
  "bers in all the districts, thus to influence the selection of Congress leaders at",
  "the higher levels of the organization. Such was Tyabji\u2019s political strategy, but",
  "he also urged his co-religionists to engage more fully with the cultural life of",
  "the country. As a \u2018patriotic Indian\u2019, he wished that the \u2018new Indian Culture\u2019",
  "that was arising \u2018be as rich and varied and vigorous as possible, and this can",
  "only be so if it draws its nourishment from all possible sources\u2019. Like other",
  "kinds of Indians, Muslims had to \u2018take an active part in its formation\u2019. But \u2018if",

  "Where the likes of Maulana Azad and Saif Tyabji sought to make",
  "Muslims into Congress Party MPs, there were others who argued that the",
  "community could better represent itself through its own organizations. In",
  "October 1953 a group of intellectuals and professionals met in Aligarh to",
  "discuss the founding of a political party to \u2018protect the minority rights of",

  "and organise themselves under one leadership to face the eventualities in fu-",
  "ture\u2019.19",
  "Meanwhile, in southern India more concrete steps were being taken in",
  "this regard. In September 1951 the \u2018Indian Union Muslim League\u2019 (IUML)",
  "came into being in Madras, both its name and its charter marking it out from",
  "the pre-Partition party some might think it resembled. It sought to \u2018secure,",
  "protect, and maintain\u2019 the religious, cultural, economic and other \u2018legitimate",
  "rights and interests of the Muslims and other minorities\u2019, but also pledged it-",
  "self to upholding and defending \u2018the independence, freedom and honour\u2019 of",
  "the Indian Union.20 Several years later, a party was formed in Hyderabad to",

  "The Muslims of India were a large minority, as well as a vulnerable one.",
  "They were under threat from Hindu communalism, and from the provoca-",
  "tion of Pakistan. The leaders of that nation tended to deride Indian secular-",
  "ism, and \u2018to presume and encourage a disloyalty of Indian Muslims to their",
  "state\u2019 Muslims were hostage to India\u2014Pakistan relations in general, and to",

  "Another problem, also linked to Partition, was the lack of a credible",
  "middle class. At or shortly after Partition, large numbers of Muslim civil ser-",
  "vants,lawyers,scholars,doctorsandentrepreneursmigratedtothenewIslam-",
  "ic state, there to carve out careers unimpeded by Hindu competition. The",
  "Muslims who remained were the labouring poor, the peasants, labourers and",
  "artisans who were now seriously in want of an enlightened and liberal lead-",
  "ership. As one perceptive British official wrote, it was \u2018one of the curses of",
  "Partition\u2019 in Bengal that \u2018the Muslim officers had all opted for Pakistan\u2019, so",
  "that \u2018the Muslim minorities in West Bengal will be without representation",
  "in the services or anywhere else where they could look for help or protec-",
  "tion\u2019.24 A partial exception was Kashmir, where under Sheikh Abdullah\u2019s re-",
  "gime between 1947 and 1953 Muslims were encouraged to own land, take to",
  "the professions and, above all, to educate themselves. Among the more far-",
  "sighted reforms were the creation of schools and colleges for girls, with the",
  "Women\u2019s College in Srinagar justly winning a countrywide reputation for ex-",
  "cellence.25 Elsewhere, Muslims continued to labour in menial jobs while be-",
  "ing under-represented in education, in the professions, in the legislatures and",
  "in the administration.26",
  "Ontheotherside,therewastheeffortoftheIndianpoliticalleadershipto",
  "createasecularstate,andtoinstilafeelingofbelongingamongtheminorities.",
  "Nehru was the key figure here, but he was aided by other Congress memberswho had studied in the school of Gandhi. When street clashes threatened to",
  "escalate into a major riot in Ahmedabad in 1956, the chief minister, Morarji",
  "Desai, went on an indefinite fast to bring back the peace.27 Such acts were",
  "prompted in part by genuine belief, and in part by diplomatic exigencies \u2013",
  "the need to put one\u2019s best face outwards while making the case for Kashmir.",
  "Attacks on Muslims would make India\u2019s claim for the Valley more fragile.28",
  "Still, it was \u2018no small matter that the Hindu leaders of the nation, in the name",
  "of secularism and humanity, restrained the natural and potentially ferocious",
  "impetus of the Hindu majority to wreak vengeance on the Muslim group\u2019.29",
  "Immediately after Partition some had feared a conflagration that would",
  "destroy the Muslim minority in India. Instead, as Mushirul Hasan has noted,",
  "\u2018the communal temperature in the 1950s remained relatively low. There was",
  "a lull after a violent storm, a clear and downward trend in communal incid-",
  "ents.\u201930Therewassuspicionandtensionontheground,andoccasionalviolent",
  "incidents,butnoriotsofthescalewitnessedduringthe1920s,1930sor1940s.",
  "The conflicts of the 1950s were rooted in language, ethnicity, class and caste,",
  "rather than in religion.",
  "The lull was broken by the Jabalpur riots of early 1961, in which some",
  "fifty Indians, mostly Muslims, lost their lives. But this was a minor affray in",
  "comparison with what happened in the winter of 1963/ 4 when the theft of",
  "the Prophet\u2019s hair from the Hazratbal mosque in Srinagar prompted a series",
  "of attacks on Hindus in distant East Pakistan. Thousands of refugees fled into",
  "India, their stories leading to a rise in the communal temperature and to re-",

  "ished, most of them Muslims.31",
  "BythistimePartitionwasalmosttwodecadesinthepast,yetitsresidues",

  "of 1963\u20134 only reinforced the \u2018fear that anything happening in Pakistan will",
  "haveitsrepercussions onMuslims inIndia,particularly whenexaggerated re-",
  "ports appear in the Indian Press, and people and parties inimical to Muslims",
  "are ready to seize the opportunity\u2019.32",
  "VIILike the Muslims, the Untouchables were spread all across India. Like them,",
  "theywerealsopoor,stigmatizedandoftenonthereceivingendofupper-caste",

  "vants,agriculturallabourers,cobblersandscavengers.BythecanonsofHindu",
  "orthodoxytheirtouchwoulddefiletheuppercastes,andinsomeregionstheir",
  "very sight too. They were denied access to land and to water sources; even",
  "their homes were set apart from the main village.",
  "Under British rule, opportunities had arisen for some Untouchables to",
  "escape the tyranny of the village. These gained employment in the army, or",
  "worked in factories and urban settlements. Here too they were usually as-",
  "signed the most menial jobs, as well as the most degrading.",
  "Gandhi had redesignated the Untouchables as \u2018Harijans\u2019, or children",
  "of God. The Constitution of India abolished untouchability and listed the",
  "erstwhile Untouchable communities in a separate schedule \u2013 hence their new,",
  "collective name, \u2018Scheduled Castes\u2019. However, village ethnographies of the",
  "1950s confirmed that the practice of untouchability continued as before. The",
  "Scheduled Castes still owned little or no land, and were still subject to social",
  "and in some cases sexual abuse. But these ethnographies also revealed that at",
  "the bottom things were changing, albeit slowly. In some parts the low castes",
  "were refusing to perform tasks that they considered demeaning. No longer",
  "would they carry loads for free, or submissively allow upper-caste males to",
  "violate their women. More daringly, they were beginning to ask for higher",
  "wages and for land to cultivate, sometimes under the aegis of communist act-",
  "ivists.33",
  "Inthecities,lower-casteassertiontookamoreorganizedform.Underthe",
  "encouragement of the Communist Party of India, the municipal sweepers of",
  "Delhi who belonged to the Balmiki caste \u2013 formed a union of their own. In",
  "October 1953 this union presented a charter of eleven demands to the muni-",
  "cipal corporation, focusing on better pay and work conditions. The sweepers",
  "heldprocessionsandpublicmeetings,andmarchedtothetownhallinashow",
  "of strength. There were also a series of hunger strikes, and at least one major",
  "confrontation with the police. The historian of these protests notes that they",
  "were \u2019not just about wages, but also about dignity and the value of the labour",
  "of the Balmikis\u2019.34",
  "VIIIThe burgeoning genre of Untouchable autobiographies also shows the 1950s",
  "to be a time of flux. Caste prejudice and caste discrimination were rampant,",
  "but no longer were they accepted so passively. There was an incipient stirring",
  "whichbecamemanifestinsocialprotestandwasaidedbythenewavenuesof",
  "social mobility.35",
  "The first such avenue was education. After Independence there was a",
  "great expansion in school and college education. By law, a certain portion",
  "of seats were reserved for the Scheduled Castes. By policy, different state",
  "governments endowed scholarships for children from disadvantaged homes.",
  "Wheretheycouldtheytookadvantage,spawninganentiregenerationoffirst-",
  "generation learners. According to one estimate, while the school population",
  "doubled in the first decade of Independence, the number of ex-Untouchables",
  "in schools swelled eight or tenfold. There were also many more Scheduled",
  "Caste students at university than ever before.36",
  "A second avenue was government employment. By law, 15 per cent of",
  "all jobs in state and state-aided institutions were reserved for the Scheduled",
  "Castes. Again, there was a massive expansion after 1947, with new positions",
  "availableintheSecretariatandingovernment-runschools,hospitals,factories",
  "and infrastructure projects. Although exact figures are hard to obtain, it is",
  "likely that several million jobs were created for Scheduled Castes in the state",
  "sectorinthefirsttwodecadesafterIndependence.Thesewerepermanentpos-",
  "itions, toberetained until retirement, andwithpensionandhealth benefits. In",
  "theory,suchreservation existed atalllevels ofgovernment; inpractice, itwas",
  "the reserved posts at the lower levels that tended to be filled first and fastest.",
  "As late as 1966, while only 1.77 per cent of senior administrative posts were",
  "occupied by Indians of low-caste origin, 8.86 per cent of clerical jobs were,",
  "and as many as 17.94 per cent of posts of peons and attendants.37",
  "There was also reservation in Parliament and state assemblies, where 15",
  "per cent of all seats were filled by Scheduled Caste candidates. Besides, uni-",
  "versal franchise meant that they could influence the outcome of elections in",
  "the\u2019unreservedcategoryaswell.Inmanyparts,ScheduledCasteswerequick",
  "to seize the opportunities the vote presented them. As one low-caste politi-",
  "cian in Agra observed, his constituents \u2018may not understand the intricacies of",
  "politics\u2019, but they did \u2018understand the power of the vote and want to use it\u2019.38",
  "Andtheyunderstooditinallcontexts\u2013national,provincialandlocal.Already",
  "in the early 1950s, cases were reported of Scheduled Castes forging alliances",

  "bersofParliament. Thosewhojoined thegovernment aslowly\u2018class IV\u2019em-",
  "ployees could see their children become members of the elite Indian Admin-",
  "istrative Service. But affirmative action also brought with it a new kind of",
  "stigma. Intended to end caste discrimination, it fixed the beneficiaries ever",
  "more firmly in their own, original caste. There was suspicion and resentment",
  "among the upper castes, and sometimes a tendency among the beneficiaries",
  "to look down upon, or even forget, their fellows. As one scholar somewhat",
  "cynicallywrote,reservationhadcreated\u2018amassofself-engrossedpeoplewho",

  "trialization and urbanization meant new opportunities away from the village,",

  "pand the mind, as in the case of a farm labourer from UP who became a fact-",
  "ory worker in Bombay and learnt to love the city\u2019s museums, its collections",
  "of Gandhara art especially.42 And sometimes there were economic gains to be",
  "made.ConsidertheJatavsofAgra,acasteofcobblersandshoemakerswhose",

  "to build and buy their own houses. While many continued as self-employed",
  "shoemakers, some Jatavs were able to open factories of their own, where the",
  "wages paid to their workers were considerably in excess of what they them-",
  "selves had once hoped to earn. In 1960 a master craftsman took home about",
  "Rs250 a month, a factory worker about Rs100 \u2013 even the lesser figure was",
  "many times what an unskilled labourer earned. Although the distribution of",
  "gains was by no means even, the market had helped enhance their econom-",
  "ic as well as social status. The present state of affairs was \u2018a far cry from the",
  "pre-1900 days, when most Jatavs were little more than labourers and city ser-",
  "vants\u2019.43",
  "IXAs with the Muslims, the Scheduled Castes formed an important \u2018vote bank\u2019",
  "for the Congress. They too tended to trust the party of Mahatma Gandhi more",
  "than its rivals. In the 1957 election, for example, the Congress won 64 out of",
  "the 76 seats reserved for Scheduled Castes in Parliament, and as many as 361",
  "out of the 469 reserved for them in the legislative assemblies.",
  "When the seats reserved for Scheduled Tribe members were added,",

  "worried him. \u2018One of my greatest difficulties\u2019, he told a senior colleague, \u2018is",
  "to find suitable non-Brahmins.\u2019 Nehru asked the colleague to suggest candid-",
  "ates, but then found one himself: a Mrs Chandrasekhar from Madras, an edu-",
  "cated Scheduled Caste whom he inducted as deputy minister.44",

  "Jagjivan Ram had the reputation of being a first-class administrator, although",
  "he did not live the kind of squeaky-clean life his Gandhian background per-",
  "haps demanded of him.45",
  "The most charismatic Scheduled Caste leader, however, remained out-",
  "sidetheCongress.ThiswasB.R.Ambedkar,whohadjoinedNehru\u2019sCabinet",
  "as an Independent, leaving the government in 1951 to restart his Scheduled",
  "Caste Federation. His party fared disastrously in the 1952 election, although",
  "Ambedkar himself was later elected to the Upper House. By now this long-",
  "time foe of Hinduism was seeking to find a way of leaving the ancestral fold.",
  "He had contemplated converting to Sikhism, then to Islam, then to Chris-",
  "tianity. Ambedkar finally settled on Buddhism, a faith of Indian origin that",
  "seemed best suited to his own rationalist and egalitarian temperament.",
  "After he left the Cabinet, Ambedkar immersed himself in literature on",
  "or about the Buddha. He became a member of the Mahabodhi Society and",
  "travelled through the Buddhist countries of south-east Asia. At a public meet-",
  "ing in Bombay in May 1956, Ambedkar announced that he would convert to",
  "Buddhism before the end of the year. His mammoth study The Buddha and",
  "his Dhamma was already in the press. Ambedkar considered holding the con-",
  "versionceremonyinBombay\u2013wherethepublicitywouldbeimmense\u2013orin",
  "the ancient Buddhist site of Sarnath. In the event he chose Nagpur, a city in",
  "the centre of India where he had a large and devoted following. Many joinedhim in embracing Buddhism, in a colourful and well-attended ceremony that",
  "took place on 15 October 1956. Six weeks later Ambedkar died suddenly. He",
  "was cremated in Bombay, with an icon of the Buddha placed under his head.",
  "A million people participated in the funeral procession.46",
  "Shortly before he died Ambedkar had decided to float a new party, the",
  "Republican Party of India. This formally came into being in 1957. Its lead-",
  "ers and cadre were, like Ambedkar himself, from the Mahar caste. It was also",
  "mostly Mahars who had followed their leader into Buddhism. Ambedkar was",
  "a figure of reverence among the Mahars of the Nagpur area. In his lifetime",
  "they celebrated his birthday with gusto, taking out processions holding his",
  "photograph aloft. When he came to town to speak, the factory workers would",
  "crowdintohearhim;eventhe\u2018womenwenttotheseparadesastoawedding\u2019.",

  "those who had been to high school or travelled outside their home village,",
  "Ambedkarwasbothexemplarandicon,themanwhohadbreachedtheupper-",

  "Ambedkar\u2019s slogan for his followers was: \u2018Educate, Agitate, Organize\u2019.",
  "He setup a People\u2019s Education Society that ran schools and at least two good",
  "colleges.ScheduledCastememberswhowenttotheseorothersschoolscame",
  "inevitably to regard Ambedkar as their mentor. Among the Scheduled Caste",
  "intelligentsia, books or pamphlets by Ambedkar became required reading,",
  "lovingly passed on from hand to hand.48 Thus the son of a dock worker, sent",
  "by government scholarship to the Siddharth College in Bombay, began con-",
  "tributing to magazines and participating in debates \u2013 where \u2018the topic of all",
  "these writings and speeches was always Babasaheb [Ambedkar] and his Dalit",
  "movement\u2019.49",
  "The presence of B. R. Ambedkar underlines a quite profound difference",
  "between the Scheduled Castes and the other minority with whom I have here",
  "compared them. For the Muslims had no seats reserved for them in the Sec-",
  "retariat or in Parliament. Nor, in independent India, did they have a leader ofAmbedkar\u2019s stature to inspire and move them \u2013 while he was alive or long",
  "after he was gone.",

  "There was pessimism about the position of Untouchables in free India,",
  "and pessimism also about the future of that other large and insecure minority,",
  "the Muslims. Travelling through India and Pakistan in 1951, the Aga Khan",

  "India was to Muslim Pakistan as Christian Sudan was to Muslim Egypt. As",
  "he putit, \u2018I have felt that this atmosphere of doom [which] prevails amongst",
  "Muslims on account of this very water question . . . is a replica of the similar",

  "Recalling the \u2018reactionary forces which came into play after partition\u2019, the",
  "editor remarked that \u2018had Nehru shown the slightest weakness, these forces",
  "would have turned this country into a Hindu state in which the minorities. .",

  "man would be scrupulously maintained in the secular state of India\u2019.56",
  "To be sure, there remained a slippage between public policy and popular",
  "practice. The laws promoting secularism and social equality were on the stat-",

  "Kamaraj was a thick-set man with a white moustache \u2013 according to one",

  "From 28 May Kamaraj began consulting his chief ministers and party bosses",
  "(the \u2018Syndicate\u2019, as they were called) on the best person to succeed Nehru. An",
  "early name to consider was Morarji Desai, the outstanding administrator from",
  "Gujarat who had made it clear that he wanted the job.",
  "In four days Kamaraj met a dozen chief ministers and as many as 200",
  "members of Parliament. From his conversations it became clear that Desai",
  "would be a controversial choice: his style was too abrasive. The person most",

  "The MP from Dewas, Hukum Chandra Kachwai, moved a resolution in the",

  "said that the nation should not rest until it had reclaimed every inch of land",
  "lost to or stolen by China. The possession of an atomic stockpile would, he",

  "A lively debate ensued, with some members endorsing Kachwai, others",

  "while the production costs referred to the United States, whose developed",
  "atomic infrastructure made the manufacture of additional bombs possible at",
  "little expense. In India, the costs would be prohibitive, said Shastri; in any",
  "case, to manufacture these deadly weapons would be to depart from the tra-",
  "dition of Gandhi and Nehru. Notably, the prime minister spoke not in narrow",
  "nationalistic terms but from the perspective of the human race. These bombs,",

  "India\u2019s Republic Day, 26 January, is annually celebrated in New Delhi by a",

  "decorated floats representing the different states competing with tanks and",
  "mountedsubmarinesforattention.In1965,RepublicDaywastobemorethan",
  "a symbolic show of national pride \u2013 it would also signal a substantial affirm-",
  "ation of national unity. Back in 1949 the Constituent Assembly had chosen",
  "Hindi as the official language of the Union of India. The constitution which",
  "ratifiedthiscameintooperationon26January1950.However,therewouldbe",
  "afifteen-year\u2018graceperiod\u2019,whenEnglishwastobeusedalongwithHindiin",
  "communication between the centre and the states. Now this period was end-",
  "ing; henceforth, Hindi would prevail.",
  "Southern politicians had long been worried about the change. In 1956",
  "theAcademyofTamilCulturepassedaresolutionurgingthat\u2018Englishshould",
  "continue to be the official language of the Union and the language for com-",
  "munication between the Union and the State Governments and between one",
  "State Government and another\u2019. The signatories included C. N. Annadurai,",
  "E. V. Ramaswami \u2018Periyar\u2019, and C. Rajagopalachari. The organization of the",
  "campaign was chiefly the work of the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK),",
  "which organized many protest meetings against the imposition of Hindi.12",
  "In the wake of the China war the DMK had dropped its secessionist",
  "plank. It no longer wanted a separate country; but it did want to protect the",
  "culture and language of the Tamil people. The DMK\u2019s acknowledged leader",
  "wasC.N.Annadurai.Knownuniversally as\u2018Anna\u2019(orelderbrother),hewas",
  "a gifted orator who had done much to build his party into a credible force in",

  "other.Ithadno\u2018specialmerit\u2019;infact,itwaslessdevelopedthanotherIndian",

  "sarcastically answered: \u2018Ifwehadtoaccept the principle ofnumerical superi-",

  "still be used along with Hindi in official communication. That caveat provedproblematic; for while Nehru clarified that \u2018may\u2019 meant \u2018shall\u2019, other Con-",
  "gress politicians thought it actually meant \u2018may not\u2019.14",
  "As 26 January 1965 approached, the opponents of Hindi geared up for",
  "action. Ten days before Republic Day, Annadurai wrote to Shastri saying that",
  "hispartywouldobservethedayofthechangeoverasa\u2018dayofmourning\u2019.But",
  "he added an interesting rider in the form of a request to postpone the day of",
  "imposition by a week. Then the DMK could enthusiastically join the rest of",
  "the nation in celebrating Republic Day.",
  "Shastri and his government stood by the decision to make Hindi official",
  "on 26 January. In response, the DMK launched a statewide campaign of",
  "protest.InnumerousvillagesbonfiresweremadetoburneffigiesoftheHindi",
  "demoness. Hindi books and the relevant pages of the constitution were also",
  "burnt. In railway stations and post offices, Hindi signs were removed or",
  "blackened over. In towns across the state there were fierce and sometimes",
  "deadly battles between the police and angry students.15",
  "The protests were usually collective: strikes and processions; bandhs,",
  "hartals and dharnas.The headlines in the Hindu newspaper tell part of the",
  "story:",

  "TEAR GASUSED INUTHAMAPALTAM",
  "There was one form of protest that was individual, and disturbingly so: the",
  "taking of one\u2019s life. On Republic Day itself, two men set themselves on fire",
  "in Madras. One left a letter saying he wanted to sacrifice himself at the altar",
  "of Tamil. Three days later a twenty-year-old man in Tiruchi poisoned him-",
  "self with insecticide. He too left a note saying his suicide was in the cause",
  "of Tamil. These \u2018martyrdoms\u2019, in turn, sparked dozens more strikes and boy-",
  "cotts.",
  "There is a vivid account of the revolt by a police officer asked to quell",
  "it. When a party of constables entered the town of Tiruppur, they found that",
  "the rioting was over but crowds still hung around, curious or sullen. Police",
  "lorries and jeeps lay burnt and smouldering on the streets and in the taluk of-ficecompound.Thepolicestationwasinashambles,asparetransmitterover-",

  "other on a street behind. A third, shot clean through the navel, lay on a river",
  "bank close by, an abusive crowd behind it still being held at bay by a rifle",
  "party.",
  "The \u2018real mistake\u2019, writes this officer, was in \u2018the failure to appreciate",
  "the depth of feeling\u2019 evoked by the imposition of Hindi. What some in New",
  "Delhi saw as \u2018an exhibition of mere parochial fanaticism\u2019 was in fact \u2018a local",
  "nationalist movement\u2019.16",
  "The intensity of the anti-Hindi protests alarmed the central government.",
  "SoonitbecameclearthattherulingCongressPartywassplitdownthemiddle",
  "on the issue. On the last day of January a group of prominent Congress Party",
  "members met in Bangalore to issue an appeal to \u2018the Hindi-loving people not",
  "to try to force Hindi on the people of non-Hindi areas\u2019. The hustling of Hindi",
  "in haste, they said, would imperil the unity of the country.",

  "the country further\u2019.17",
  "Theprimeminister,LalBahadurShastri,wasnowplacedinthehotseat.",
  "His heart was with the Hindi zealots; his head, however, urged him to listen",
  "to other voices. On 11 February the resignation of two Union ministers from",
  "Madras forced his hand. The same evening the prime minister went on All-",
  "India Radio to convey his \u2018deep sense of distress and shock\u2019 at the \u2018tragic",

  "would fully honour Nehru\u2019s assurance that English would be used as long as",
  "the people wanted. Then he made four assurances of his own:First,everystatewouldhavecompleteandunfetteredfreedomtocontin-",
  "ue to transact its own business in the language of its own choice, which may",
  "be the regional language or English.",
  "Secondly, communications from one state to another would be either in",

  "without the consent of the non-Hindi states.",
  "Fourthly,inthetransactionofbusinessatthecentrallevelEnglishwould",

  "Later, Shastri added a crucial fifth assurance \u2013 that the All-India Civil",
  "Services Examination would continue to be conducted in English rather than",
  "(as the Hindiwallahs wanted) in Hindi alone.18",
  "A week after the prime minister spoke on the radio there was a long and",
  "veryheateddiscussioninParliamentontheriotsintheTamilcountry.Propon-",
  "ents of Hindi insisted that those who opposed the language were against the",
  "constitution and in effect anti-national; they also claimed that by giving in to",
  "violence the government would encourage more outbreaks of violence. Tamil",
  "members answered that they had \u2018already sacrificed enough for the Hindi de-",
  "mon\u2019. They were supported by two stalwarts from Bengal \u2013 Hiren Mukher-",
  "jee from the left, who accused the Hindi zealots of a \u2018contemptuous disreg-",
  "ard\u2019 for those who did not speak their language, and N. C. Chatterjee from",
  "the right, who pointed out that \u2018the greatest integrating force today is the jur-",
  "idical and the legal unity of India\u2019, this enabled by the fact that the Supreme",
  "Court and the High Courts functioned in English. The Anglo-Indian member,",
  "FrankAnthony,deploredthe\u2018increasingintolerance,increasingobscurantism,",
  "increasing chauvinism of those who purport to speak on behalf of Hindi\u2019. J.",
  "B. Kripalani, speaking in a lighter vein, thought that the Hindi chauvinists",
  "had no hope at all. Even Indian babies, he noted, now \u2018do not say: Amma or",
  "Appa, but mummy and papa. We talk to our dogs also in English.\u2019 Kripalani",
  "remarked that \u2018Mr Anthony is very unnecessarily excited about the fate of his",

  "Theparallelswiththelanguagequestionofthe1950sareuncanny.Then,",
  "too, a popular social movement led the prime minister of the day to recon-",
  "siderboththestatedofficialpositionandhisownpreferences.Nehruopposed",
  "linguistic states; Shastri believed Hindi should be the sole official language",
  "of the Union. But when protest spilled out into the streets, and when protest-",
  "ers were willing to offer their lives \u2013 Potti Sriramulu in 1953, a dozen Tamilyoung men in 1965 \u2013 the prime minister was forced to reconsider. Strikingly,",
  "in each case the Congress rank and file seemed to side with the opposition",
  "rather than with their own government. As withNehru, Shastri\u2019s change of",
  "heart was occasioned as much by considerations of preserving party unity as",
  "by the unity of the nation itself.",

  "Abdullah seems not to have said anything indiscreet in the United King-",
  "dom. He proceeded to Mecca and stopped in Algiers on his way home. There",
  "he did something far worse than speak carelessly to a British journalist; he",
  "met with the Chinese prime minister, Chou En-lai, who also happened to be",
  "in the Algerian capital. The content of their conversations was not disclosed,",
  "but it was enough that he had supped with the enemy. It was assumed that (as",
  "in 1953, when he met Adlai Stevenson) Sheikh Abdullah had discussed the",
  "possibility of an independent Kashmir. Back then it took four months for the",
  "Sheikh to be jailed. Now he was placed under arrest as he got off the plane",
  "at New Delhi s Palam Airport. He was taken to a government bungalow in",

  "The news of the Sheikh\u2019s arrest was greeted with loud cheers in both",
  "Houses of Parliament. He was seen as having betrayed India not just by talk-ing to a Chinese leader, but by doing so while the other foe, Pakistan, was",
  "nibbling away at the borders. For while Abdullah was on pilgrimage a con-",
  "flict broke out over the Rann of Kutch, a salt marsh claimed both by Pakistan",

  "One person dismayed by the rise of jingoism was Horace Alexander. He",
  "wrote to Mrs Indira Gandhi and received a reply putting the inflamed senti-",
  "ments in perspective. \u2018What Sheikh Sahib does not realize\u2019, said Mrs Gandhi,",
  "\u2018is that with the Chinese invasion and the latest moves in and by Pakistan,",
  "the position of Kashmir has completely changed.\u2019 For the frontiers of the",
  "state touched China and the USSR as well as India and Pakistan. And \u2018in the",
  "present world situation, an independent Kashmir would become a hot-bed of",
  "intrigue and, apart from the countries mentioned above, would also attract es-",
  "pionage and other activities from the USA and UK.\u201922",
  "Abdullah\u2019s arrest and the clash in Kutch had put an idea into the head of",
  "the Pakistani president, Ayub Khan. This was to foment an insurrection in the",
  "IndianpartofKashmir,leading either toawarendingwiththestate beingan-",

  "Radio Pakistan announced that a popular uprising had broken out in the Val-",
  "ley. In fact, the local population was mostly apathetic \u2013 some intruders were",
  "even handed over to the police. 24",
  "When the hoped-for rebellion did not materialize, Pakistan launched its",
  "reserve plan, codenamed \u2018Operation Grand Slam\u2019. Troops crossed the cease-",

  "On 1 September the Pakistan army launched a major offensive in Ch-",
  "hamb. An infantry division with two regiments of American Patton tankscrossed the border. Catching the Indians by surprise, they occupied thirty",
  "square miles within twenty-four hours. Their aim was to capture the bridge",
  "at Akhnoor, thus to sever links between Jammu and Kashmir and the state of",
  "Punjab. The defenders now called in their air force, with some thirty aircraft",
  "raining down bombs on the enemy. The Indian Vampires were answered by",
  "Pakistani Sabre jets.",
  "By the 5th the Indian position was getting desperate, with the Pakistanis",
  "pressing hard on Akhnoor. To relieve the pressure, New Delhi ordered the",
  "army to open a new front. On the morning of the 6th, several tank regiments,",

  "There was, indeed, an unmistakably religious idiom to an operation ini-",
  "tiated by Pakistani Muslims on behalf of their brethren in Kashmir. Memor-",
  "ies of wars fought and won ten centuries ago were evoked. The radicals in",
  "Pakistan believed that the kafir would be vanquished by the combination of",

  "Patton tank, a gesture that would not have come easily to his predecessor.",
  "However, in one respect Shastri was indeed like Nehru \u2013 in his refusal",
  "to mix matters of state with matters of faith. Days after the ceasefire, with",
  "patriotic feelings riding high, he spoke at a public meeting at the Ram Lila",
  "grounds in Delhi. Here he took issue with a BBC report that claimed that",
  "\u2018since India\u2019s Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri is a Hindu, he is ready for",
  "warwithPakistan\u2019.ShastrisaidthatwhilehewasaHindu,\u2018MirMushtaqwho",

  "thing about our country is that we have Hindus, Muslims, Christians, Sikhs,",
  "Parsis and people of all other religions. We have temples and mosques, gurd-",
  "waras and churches. But we do not bring this all into politics . . . This is the",
  "difference between IndiaandPakistan. Whereas Pakistan proclaims herselfto",
  "be an Islamic State and uses religion as a political factor, we Indians have the",
  "freedomtofollowwhateverreligionwemaychoose[and]worshipinanyway",

  "Infact,oneofShastri\u2019sfirstactsasprimeministerwastoincreasebudget",
  "allocations to agriculture. He was deeply concerned about the shortfalls in",
  "food production in recent years. The rate of increase of food grain had just",
  "about kept pace with the growth of population. If the rains failed, panic set",
  "in, with merchants hoarding grain and the state desperate to move stocks",
  "from surplus to deficit areas. There had been a drought in 1964, and anoth-",
  "er in 1965. Seeking along-term solution, Shastri appointed C. Subramaniam",
  "to head the Ministry of Food and Agriculture. Born in 1910 into a family of",
  "farmers,Subramaniamhaddegreesinscienceandthelaw,andpractisedasan",
  "advocate before joining the freedom struggle. He had been a member of the",
  "Constituent Assembly, and was a widely admired minister in Madras beforehe joined the Union Cabinet. Subramaniam was known to be intelligent and",
  "a go-getter, which is why Nehru had placed him in charge of the prestigious",
  "Ministry of Steel and Mines. To shift him from Steel to Agriculture signalled",
  "a major change indeed.42",
  "Subramaniam took to his new job with vigour. He focused on the reor-",
  "ganization of agricultural science, improving the pay and working conditions",
  "of scientists and protecting them from bureaucratic interference. The Indian",
  "Council for Agricultural Research, previously a somewhat somnolent body,",
  "acquired a new life and identity. Besides reviving the ICAR, Subramaniam",
  "also encouraged the states to set up agricultural universities, whose research",
  "focused on crops particular to that region. He began experimental farms, and",
  "set up a Seed Corporation of India to produce, in bulk, the quality seeds that",
  "would be needed for the proposed programmes of agricultural intensification.",
  "TwoofSubramaniamskeyaideswere,likehim,fromtheTamilcountry.",
  "One was the able secretary of agriculture, B. Sivaraman; the other was the",
  "scientist M. S. Swaminathan, who was directing the research teams adapting",
  "Mexican wheat to Indian conditions. It was around this crop that the new",
  "strategy revolved. Notably, while wheat is grown principally in the north of",
  "the country, these three architects of India s agricultural policy were all from",
  "the (very deep) south.43",
  "Meanwhile, Subramaniam prevailed upon the United States to provide",
  "food aid till such time as the Indians were able to augment their own produc-",
  "tion. He met with and impressed the American president, Lyndon Johnson,",
  "and forged a close partnership with the US secretary of agriculture, Orville",
  "Freeman.InDecember1965SubramaniamandFreemansignedanagreement",
  "in Rome whereby India committed itself to a substantial increase in invest-",
  "mentinagriculture,toareformoftheruralcreditsystem,andtoanexpansion",
  "of fertilizer production and consumption. In return, the Americans provided a",
  "series of soft loans and agreed to keep wheat supplies going to tide over the",
  "shortages at the Indian end.44",
  "WhileSubramaniamwassigningwhatwasinformallycalled\u2018TheTreaty",
  "of Rome\u2019, his prime minister was preparing to go to Moscow to sign a treaty",
  "of his own. This was with his Pakistani counterpart, Ayub Khan. After the",
  "war had ended, the Soviets offered their help in working out a peace settle-",
  "ment. In the first week of January 1966 Shastri and Ayub met in Tashkent,",
  "with the Soviet prime ministerAlexei Kosygin as the chief mediator. After a",

  "country to a state of near collapse, but this time, when war came, \u2018everything",

  "were gone.\u2019 46",

  "In the first months of the new prime minister\u2019s tenure, Mrs Indira Gandhi had",
  "complained that he was departing from herfather\u2019s legacy. Within a year she",

  "Once more, Morarji Desai threw his hat in the ring. Once more, Kamaraj re-",
  "jected him in favour of a more widely acceptable candidate.",
  "ThepersonwhomtheCongresspresident hadinmindtosucceed Shastri",
  "was Mrs Indira Gandhi. She was young \u2013 having just turned forty-eight \u2013 at-",
  "tractive, known to world leaders, and the daughter of the best-loved of Indi-",
  "ans. To soothe a nation hit by two quick losses, she seemed the most obvious",
  "choice. True, Mrs Gandhi had little administrative experience, but this time",
  "theCongress\u2018Syndicate\u2019wouldensurethatherswouldbeaproperly\u2018collect-",
  "ive\u2019 leadership.",
  "The chief ministers consulted by Kamaraj quickly endorsed Mrs",
  "Gandhi\u2019s name. So far, so good \u2013 except that Morarji Desai decided he would",
  "contest for the leadership. So New Delhi now \u2018became the cockpit of concer-",
  "ted canvassing, large-scale lobbying, and hectic horse-trading\u2019. Mrs Gandhi",
  "and Morarji Desai met with major leaders, while their seconds stalked the",
  "rankand file.49",
  "In terms of experience as well as ability Desai should have been the fa-",
  "vourite. Jawaharlal Nehru had once written of him that there \u2018were very few",
  "people whomIrespect somuchfortheir rectitude, ability,efficiency andfair-",
  "ness as Morarji Desai\u2019.50 It is doubtful whether he would have written about",

  "gress Party having their own reservations regarding Desai, Nehru\u2019s daughter",
  "commanded majority support in the Congress Parliamentary Party. When that",
  "body voted to choose a prime minister on 19 January 1966, she won by 355",

  "Mrs Gandhi was the second woman to be elected to lead a free nation",
  "(Sirimavo Bandaranaike of Ceylon having been the first); and the second",
  "member of her own family to become prime minister of India. Her first",

  "The origins of the Mizo conflict go back to a famine in 1959, when a",
  "massive flowering of bamboo led to an explosion in the population of rats.",
  "These devoured the grain in the fields and in village warehouses, causing",
  "a scarcity of food for humans. A Mizo National Famine Front was formed,",
  "which found the state\u2019s response wanting. The first \u2018F\u2019 was then dropped,",
  "leadingtothecreation oftheMizoNational Front(MNF).Thisaskedfirstfor",
  "a separate state within the Indian Union and then for a separate country itself.",
  "The leader of the MNF was a one-time accountant named Laldenga.",
  "Deeply affected by the famine, he sought succour in books \u2013 the detective",
  "stories of Peter Cheyney to begin with, graduating in time to the works of",
  "Winston Churchill and primers on guerrilla warfare. In the winter of 1963/4",
  "Laldenga made contact with the military government of East Pakistan, who",
  "promised him guns and money, and a base from which to mount attacks. The",
  "arms so obtained were cached in forests along the border.52",
  "After years of patient planning, during which he recruited many young",
  "Mizosandtrainedthemintheuseofmodernweaponry,Laldengalaunchedan",
  "uprising on the last day of February 1966. Groups of MNF soldiers attacked",
  "government offices and installations, looted banks, and disrupted communic-",
  "ations. Roads were blocked to prevent the army moving troops into the area.",
  "In early March the MNF announced that the territory had seceded from the",
  "Indian Union and was now an \u2018independent\u2019 republic.53",
  "TheMNFcapturedonemaintown,Lungleh,andpressedhardonthedis-",
  "trict capital, Aizawl. The Indian response was tocall inthe army,andalso the",

  "over firing. Pakhlira saw his house go up in flames. We prepared a meal",
  "of rice in a small house, but decided that it wasn\u2019t safe to sleep there and",
  "we all slept out in a terrace in the jungle where there was a sheltering",

  "The letter vividly captures the frightening position of ordinary Mizos caught",
  "in the cross-fire between the insurgents and the state. It goes on to speak, in",
  "more reflective vein, of how the conflict",
  "will be a very serious setback for the country . . . The government had",

  "Far from surrendering, the rebels fought on, the conflict running for the rest",
  "of the year and into the next. Meanwhile, in Nagaland, the Peace Mission had",
  "collapsed. In the last week of February 1966 Jayaprakash Narayan resigned",
  "fromthemission,sayingthathehadlosttheconfidenceoftheNagas.\u2018JP\u2019hadtoldtheundergroundthatintheaftermathoftheIndoPakistanwartheyshould",
  "drop their demand for independence, and settle for autonomy within the Indi-",
  "an Union instead. In the federal system, foreign affairs and defence were in",
  "the hands of the centre, but the things that most mattered \u2013 education, health,",
  "economic development, culture \u2013 were in the control of the states. So JP ad-",
  "vised Phizo\u2019s men to shed their arms and contest elections, thus to take over",
  "the administration by peaceful means.55",
  "At the same time as JP became disenchanted with the rebels, Michael",
  "Scott had lost the confidence of the Indian government. They accused him of",
  "seeking to \u2018internationalize\u2019 the Naga issue by approaching the United Na-",
  "tions. Scott had suggested that likely models for Nagaland were Bhutan and",
  "Sikkim \u2013 nominally independent countries each with its own flag, currency",
  "and ruler, but militarily subordinated to India. In May 1966 New Delhi asked",
  "Scotttoleavethecountry,makingitclearthathewasnotwelcometoreturn.56",
  "There was no question that Michael Scott was deeply committed to the",

  "From these rebellions the new prime minister turned with relief to the",
  "creation of a separate state for the Sikhs. In the war against Pakistan, Sikh",
  "commanders as well as jawans had distinguished themselves in large num-",

  "The World Bank and the International Monetary Fund had both recom-",

  "trade union called it \u2018a shameful act of national betrayal\u2019.",

  "Kamaraj, for one, saw it as undermining the policy of national self-reliance.",
  "Buttheactionwassupportedbythefree-market Swatantra Party,whosemain",

  "a first step in a policy of economic realism in place of the doctrinaire policies",
  "pursued by the Congress government, it would have some desirable results in",
  "boosting the exports and promoting the inflow of foreign capital\u2019.",
  "Writing to a friend, the prime minister said that the devaluation was a",

  "ives which had been tried for the last two years did not produce satisfactory",

  "Throughout 1966, one place that had been unusually quiet was the Valley of",
  "Kashmir. The war of 1965 had put secessionists on the back foot. The chief",
  "minister, G. M. Sadiq, was providing an efficient and clean administration,",
  "conspicuously so in comparison to Bakshi Ghulam Mohammed\u2019s. The tourist",
  "trade was booming, as was the market for Kashmiri handicrafts.",

  "as nothing else has done\u2019, said JP. Even now, while peace reigned on the sur-",

  "TheonlywaytogetridofthiswastoreleaseSheikhAbdullahafterpromising",
  "\u2018full internal autonomy, i.e., a return to the original terms of the accession\u2019. A",
  "settlement with Abdullah, believed JP, \u2018may give us the only chance we may",
  "have of solving the Kashmir problem\u2019. For \u2018the Sheikh is the only Kashmiri",
  "leader who could swing Muslim opinion in the valley towards his side\u2019.",
  "His talks with Chou En-lai led to Sheikh Abdullah being dubbed a \u2018trait-",
  "or\u2019, but in JP\u2019s view that act, though indiscreet, was certainly not treasonous.",
  "In any case, the Sheikh had come back to India to answer his detractors. JP\u2019s",
  "associate Narayan Desai met the Kashmiri leader in Kodaikanal and found",
  "him amenable to the idea of full autonomy. In the aftermath of the recent war",
  "with Pakistan, Abdullah saw quite clearly that an independent Kashmir was",
  "out of the question. So Narayan now suggested that the government release",
  "Abdullah and permit him to contest the upcoming 1967 general election, to",
  "assure the Kashmiris that \u2018they would be rid of the overbearing Indian police",
  "and enjoy full freedom to order their lives as they liked\u2019. If the Sheikh fought",
  "and won in the election, if \u2018it could be shown that they [the Kashmiris] had",
  "taken that decision freely at an election run by their own genuine leaders . . .,",
  "Pakistan will have no ground left to interfere in their affairs\u2019.",
  "To \u2018hold a general election in Kashmir with Sheikh Abdullah in prison\u2019,",
  "remarked Narayan, \u2018is like the British ordering an election in India while",
  "Jawaharlal Nehru was in prison. No fair-minded person would call it a fair",
  "election\u2019. This was a point that should have counted with Mrs Gandhi, but in",
  "case it didn\u2019t, JP offered this melancholy prediction:",
  "If we miss the chance of using the next general election to win the con-",
  "sent of the [Kashmiri] people to their place within the Union, I cannot",
  "see what other device will be left to India to settle the problem. To think",
  "thatwewilleventuallyweardownthepeopleandforcethemtoacceptat",
  "least passively the Union is to delude ourselves. That might conceivably",
  "have happened had Kashmir not been geographically located where it is.",
  "In its present location, and with seething discontent among the people, it",
  "would never be left in peace by Pakistan.70",
  "The prime minister wrote a brief note back, thanking JP \u2018for sharing your",

  "The decision to delay the Vizag steel plant caused an outcry in the",

  "chantment \u2013 and the hope of productive employment. Protesters blockaded",

  "the Jana Sangh, the call had been converted into asocial movement.",
  "On 6 November a huge procession was taken through the streets of the",
  "capital. Among the 100,000 marchers were many sadhus brandishing tridents",
  "and spears. The march culminated in a public meeting outside ParliamentHouse, where the first speaker was Swami Karpatri (of Anti-Hindu Code Bill",

  "a beeline for the building, shouting \u201cSwami Rameshwaranand kijai\u201d\u2019. At this",
  "point the Jana Sangh leader Atal Behari Vajpayee appealed to the swami to",
  "withdraw his call. It was too late. As the sadhus surged towards Parliament\u2019s",
  "gates, they were turned back by mounted police. A ding-dong battle ensued:",
  "tear-gas and rubber bullets on the one side, sticks and stones on the other. As",
  "thick columns of smoke rose over the Houses of Parliament, the crowd re-",
  "treated, only to vent its anger on what lay in its way. The security kiosk of",
  "All-India Radio was gutted, and the house of K. Kamaraj, the Congress pres-",

  "10 buses. By the evening the army was patrolling the streets, for the first time",
  "since the dark days of 1947.",
  "An agitation led by holy men, commented one journal acidly, had resul-",
  "ted in an \u2018orgy of violence, vandalism and hooliganism\u2019. A. B. Vajpayee is-",
  "sued a statement deploring the fact that \u2018the undesirable elements, who resor-",
  "ted to violent activities in the demonstration against cow-slaughter, had done",
  "a great harm to the pious cause\u2019.75",
  "XIII",
  "There was a line of thinking, widely prevalent in the West, which held that",
  "only the personality and example of Jawaharlal Nehru had kept India united",
  "and democratic. The quick changes of guard since his death, the successive",
  "droughts, the countless small rebellions and the major war with Pakistan \u2013",
  "these, taken together, seemed only to confirm these fears. In December 1965",
  "theSydneyMorningHeraldworriedforthefutureofdemocracyinIndia.The",
  "paper saw a \u2018sweeping upsurge of nationalistic spirit\u2019 in the country, which",
  "was \u2018in danger of turning into chauvinism, with increasing bitterness towards",
  "the Western powers\u2019. This intolerance seemed also to be directed inwards:",
  "\u2018What many foreign observers are finding particularly perturbing is that free",
  "expression of liberal views by Indians seems to be in danger.\u201976",
  "The same year, 1965, the writer Ronald Segal published a major study",
  "titled \u2018The Crisis of India\u2019. On a tour of the country he found it on \u2018the eco-",
  "nomic precipice\u2019, with the \u2018ground . . . crumbling beneath her . Meanwhile,\u2018her international stock was low and falling\u2019. With poverty, scarcity, regional",

  "munism on the left\u2019 and \u2018militant communalism on the right\u2019, one or other of",
  "which was likely to prevail before too many years had passed.77",
  "Also despairing of the country\u2019s future was Reverend Michael Scott. A",
  "friend who met him in May 1966 found him",

  "integrate and that the whole thing may sink into a Vietnam-type morass",

  "When the monsoon failed again in 1966, the predictions were of mass star-",

  "To many Western environmentalists, India seemed to provide striking proof",
  "of Malthus\u2019s prophecy that human population growth would one day outstrip",
  "food supply. The respected Stanford biologist Paul Ehrlich wrote that while",

  "There are some fine ethnographic accounts of the 1967 Indian general elec-",
  "tion, field studies of different constituencies by scholars familiar with their",
  "culture and social composition. These show that elections were no longer a",
  "top-dressing on inhospitable soil; they had been fully indigenized, made part",
  "of Indian life, a festival with its own unique set of rituals, enacted every five",
  "years. The energy and intensity of this particular iteration was manifest in the",
  "large turnout at rallies and leaders speeches, and in the colourful posters and",
  "slogans used to glorify parties or debunk their opponents. The rivalries were",
  "intense,atthestateaswellasthenationallevel.OpposingtherulingCongress",
  "werepartiestoitsleft,suchasthevariouscommunistandsocialistfragments;",
  "and parties to the right, such as Jana Sangh and Swatantra. In some states theCongress\u2019scompetitioncamefromregionalgroupings\u2013suchastheAkaliDal",
  "in the Punjab and the DMK in Madras.",
  "As these ethnographies reveal, twenty years of economic development",
  "had deepened and complicated the process of political competition. Often,",
  "rivalcandidateshadcuttheirteethrunningschools,collegesandco-operatives",
  "before contesting a legislative or parliamentary election. Those institutions",
  "were vehicles of prestige and patronage, their control valuable in itself and a",
  "means of mobilizing voter support.3",
  "The election of 1967 is the first I have any personal memories of. What",
  "I remember best is this slogan, shouted with vigour along the streets of the",
  "small sub-Himalayan town in which I lived: \u2018Jana Sangh ko vote do, bidi",
  "peena chhod do/ Bidi mein tambaku hai, Kangresswala daku hai\u2019.",
  "The Congress Party was full of thieves, and the cheroot contained that",
  "dangerous substance, tobacco: by rejecting both and embracing the Jana",
  "Sangh\u2013theleadingoppositionpartyintown\u2013thevoterwouldpurifyhimself",
  "as well as the government. Such was the slogan\u2019s message, which apparently",
  "resonated with many citizens. So found a survey of voters in thirteen states,",
  "conducted by the country\u2019s pioneer pollster, E. P. W. da Costa of the Indian",

  "tion \u2018for the first time, as a political loser not as a guaranteed victor\u2019.",
  "The survey suggested that while the Congress would retain power in the",
  "centre, it would drop its vote share by 2\u20133 percentage points and lose perhaps",
  "fiftyseatsintheLokSabha.Butitwouldloseevenmoreheavilyinthestates.",
  "According to da Costa, non-Congress governments would be formed in the",
  "states of Kerala, Madhya Pradesh and Rajas-than, and perhaps also in Orissa,",
  "West Bengal, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and Punjab.",
  "Why had support for the Congress declined? The survey found that the",
  "minorities, once a loyal vote bank, were disenchanted with the party, as were",
  "largesectionsoftheyoungandthelesseducated.Ontheotherside,theoppos-",
  "ition was more united than before. In most states, non-Congress parties had",
  "made seat adjustments \u2013 which meant that, unlike in the past, the Congress",
  "could not so easily benefit from a three- or four-way division of the vote.",

  "As da Costa saw it, this fourth general election would inaugurate a",
  "\u2018second Non-Violent Revolution in India\u2019s recent history\u2019. The first was be-",
  "gun by Mahatma Gandhi in 1919, and culminated in Independence in 1947.",
  "Since then,theCongress hadheldpowerinthecentre aswell asall thestates,",
  "except for a very brief spell in Kerala. Now, this election would signal \u2018the",
  "disintegration of the monolithic exercise of power by the Congress Party\u2019.",
  "Da Costa\u2019s conclusion is worth quoting: \u2018To the candidates this is, perhaps, a",
  "struggle for power; to the political scientist it is, as nearly half a century ago,",
  "the beginning of a break with the past. It is by no means yet a revolt; but it",
  "may in time be a revolution.\u20194",
  "Poll predictions are notorious for being unreliable \u2013 in India perhaps",

  "have felt vindicated. In the Lok Sabha the Congress\u2019s seat tally had dropped",
  "from 361 to 283, while its losses in the state assemblies were even greater.",
  "The party\u2019s decline is summed up in Table 19.1.",
  "III",
  "The most humiliating defeat suffered by the Congress was in the southern",
  "state of Madras. Here, the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) swept the",
  "polls, winning 138 seats out of a total of 234 in the Assembly. The Congress",
  "wonamere50.TheDMKleaderC.N.Annaduraiwassworninaschiefmin-",

  "MadrashadlongbeenaCongressstronghold;manynationalleaders,past",
  "and present, hailed from the state. Now, even the venerable K. Kamaraj was",
  "washed away in the landslide. He lost in his home town, Virudhunagar, to",
  "a 28-year-old student activist named P. Srinivasan. When the news reached",
  "Madras,jubilantDMKcadresfoundanamesakeofthevictor,placedhimonahorse and paraded him through the city. Of the Congress president\u2019s defeat, a",
  "respected weekly wrote that \u2018in terms of political prestige, here and abroad, it",
  "was beyond any doubt, the worst blow ever suffered by Mr. Kamaraj\u2019s party,",
  "before or after independence\u2019.5",
  "TheCongresshadafairlygoodrecordinthestate;itsadministrationwas",
  "known to be clean and efficient. Some commentators thought that the DMK",
  "rode to victory on the back of the anti-Hindi agitation of 1965. However, that",
  "movement itself was made possible by patient organizational work over the",
  "past decade. The DMK had fanned out into the towns and villages, creating",
  "local clubs and party branches. Crucial here were its links with the hugely",
  "popular Tamil film industry. One of its main leaders, M. Karunanidhi, was a",
  "successful scriptwriter. More important, it had the support \u2013 moral as well as",
  "material \u2013 of the great popular film hero M. G. Ramachandran (MGR).",
  "OriginallyfromKerala,butborntoafamilyofplantationlabourersinSri",
  "Lanka, MGR had a fanatical following in the Tamil countryside. In his films",
  "he vanquished the forces of evil, these variously represented by policemen,",
  "landlords, foreigners and the state. The movies he starred in played to packed",
  "houses, with viewers seeing them over and over again. Many of his most de-",
  "voted fans were women.",
  "All across Madras, MGR manrams (fan clubs) had been established.",
  "These discussed his films and also his politics. ForMGR was a longtime sup-",
  "porter of the DMK. He gave money to the party, and was always at hand to",
  "speak at its rallies and conferences.",
  "A month before the 1967 elections, MGR was shot and wounded by a",
  "rival film star named M. R. Radha (the two, apparently, had fallen out over",
  "what men ingeneral, andIndian film stars inparticular,usually fall outover).",
  "Photographs of the wounded hero were abundantly used in the election cam-",
  "paign. MGR himself decided to stand \u2013 he won his seat in a canter, and his",
  "party did the same.6",
  "In power, the DMK practised what one scholar has called an \u2018assertive",
  "and paternalist populism\u2019. Where the Congress brought large industrial pro-",
  "jects to the state, the DMK focused on schemes that might win it immediate",
  "support. Thus it increased the percentage of government jobs reserved for the",
  "lower castes who were its own chief source of support. Greater control was",
  "exercised over the trade in cereals, and food subsidies granted to the urban",
  "poor. Meanwhile, to foster regional pride, the government organized an inter-",
  "national conference on Tamil culture and language, in which scholars from",
  "twentycountriesparticipated,andwherethechiefministerexpressedthehope",
  "that Tamil would become the link language for the whole of India.7IV",
  "The Congress also lost in Kerala, to an alliance of the left. In 1963 the Com-",
  "munist Party of India (CPI) had split into two fractions, the newer one called",
  "the Communist Party of India (Marxist), or CPM. It was the CPM which had",
  "themoredynamicleaders,includingE.M.S.Namboo-diripad.NowtheCPM",
  "won 52 out of the 133 seats in the Kerala State Assembly; the Congress 30,",
  "and the CPI 19. The communists came together to form the government, with",
  "EMS being sworn in for his second term as chief minister.",
  "The Congress had previous experience of losing in Kerala but, to its",
  "distress, it also lost power in West Bengal, where the party had held undis-",
  "puted sway since 1947. The winners in that state were the United Front\u2013Left",
  "Frontalliance,itsmainmemberstheBanglaCongress(asitsnamesuggests,a",
  "breakawayfromthemotherparty),andtheCPM.Intheassemblyelectionsthe",
  "Congresswon127seatsoutofaHouseof280.Ontheotherside,theCPMhad",
  "43 and the Bangla Congress 34; joined by an assortment of left-wing groups",
  "and independents, they could just about muster a majority.",
  "TheBanglaCongressleaderAjoyMukherjeebecamechiefminister.The",
  "deputy chief minister was Jyoti Basu, an urbane, London-educated lawyer",
  "who had long been the civilized face of Bengali communism. Basu and some",
  "others thought that their party could shape the government\u2019s policies from",
  "within. Other CPM members, notably its chief organizer Promode Dasgupta,",
  "thought that the party should never have joined the government at all.8",
  "Whole books have been written on doctrinal disputes within the Indian",
  "communist movement. Here, we need know only that the Communist Party",
  "of India split in 1963 on account of two differences: one external to the coun-",
  "try, the other internal to it. The two issues were connected. The parent party,",
  "the CPI, was closely tied to the apron strings of the Communist Party of the",
  "SovietUnion;oneconsequenceofthiswasthatithadforswornarmedrevolu-",
  "tion,ifonlybecausetheSovietswantedgoodrelationswiththegovernmentof",
  "India. The breakaway CPM believed in fraternal relations with both the Rus-",
  "sian and Chinese communist parties. It saw the Indian state as run by a bour-",
  "geois\u2013landlord alliance and parliamentary democracy as mostly a sham; to be",
  "used when it suited one\u2019s purposes, and to be discarded when it didn\u2019t.9",
  "ThedecisionoftheCPMtojointhegovernmentwasprecededbyabitter",
  "debate, with Jyoti Basu speaking in favour and Promode Dasgupta against.",
  "Ultimately the party joined, only to create a great sense of expectation among",
  "the cadres. An early gesture was to rename Harrington Road after a hero ofthe world communist movement, so that at the height of the Vietnam War the",
  "address of the United States Consulate was 7 Ho Chi Minh Sarani, Calcutta.",
  "That was easy enough; but henceforth the decisions became harder. In",
  "the spring of 1967 a land dispute broke out in Naxalbari, in the Darjeeling",
  "district, where India\u2019s borders touched Nepal on the west and Pakistan on the",
  "east, with Tibet and the semi-independent kingdoms of Bhutan and Sikkim",
  "not far away. The economy in these Himalayan foothills was dominated by",
  "tea plantations, many run by British-owned companies. There was a history",
  "of land scarcity, and of conflicts over land \u2013 with plantation workers seeking",
  "plots of their own, and indigenous sharecroppers seeking relief from usurious",
  "landlords.",
  "In the Naxalbari area, the rural poor were mobilized by a krishak samiti",
  "(peasants\u2019 organization) owing allegiance to the CPM. Its leader was a",
  "middle-class radical named Kanu Sanyal, whose rejectionof his social milieu",
  "infavourofworkinthevillageshadwonhimaconsiderablefollowing.From",
  "late March 1967 the samiti organized a series of demonstrations against land-",
  "lords who had evicted tenants and/or hoarded grain. These protests became",
  "more militant, leading to skirmishes with the police, which turned violent. A",
  "constable was killed; in retaliation, the police fired on a crowd. The peasant",
  "leaders decided to take to arms, and soon landlords were being beheaded.",
  "The protests had their roots in the deeply inequitable agrarian structure",
  "of northern Bengal. But they may not have taken the form they did had the",
  "CPM not joined the government. Some activists, and perhaps many peasants,",
  "felt that now that their party was in power, they were at liberty to set right the",
  "feudalstructureontheirown.Totheirsurprise,thepartyreactedbytakingthe",
  "side of the forces of law and order. By the late summer of 1967 an estimated",
  "1,500policemenwereondutyinNaxalbari.KanuSanyalandhisfellowlead-",
  "ers were in jail, while other rebels had taken refuge in the jungle.10",
  "Naxalbari quickly came to enjoy an iconic status among Indian revolu-",
  "tionaries. The village gave its name to the region and, in time, to anyone",
  "anywhere who would use arms to fight the Indian state on behalf of the op-",
  "pressed and disinherited. \u2018Naxalite\u2019 became shorthand for \u2018revolutionary\u2019, a",
  "term evoking romance and enchantment at one end of the political spectrum",
  "and distaste and derision at the other.11",
  "Among those who approved of the Naxalites were the leaders of com-",
  "munist China. In the last week of June 1967 Radio Peking announced thatA phase of peasants\u2019 armed struggle led by the revolutionaries of the In-",

  "of the Indian revolution at the present time. The people of India, China",
  "and the rest of the world hail the emergence of this revolutionary armed",
  "struggle.12",
  "While thefirstsparksofrevolution werebeinglit inNaxalbari, another group",
  "of Maoists were preparing for action in Andhra Pradesh. The Andhra \u2018Nax-",
  "alites\u2019 were active in two regions: Telengana, where there had been a ma-",
  "jor communist insurgency in 1946-9, and the Srikakulam district, bordering",
  "Orissa. In both regions the areas of dispute were land and forests. In both",
  "the main agents of exploitation were the state and landlords, the main vic-",
  "tims peasants and (especially) tribals. And in both, communist mobilization",
  "focused on free access to forest produce, better wages for labourers and the",
  "redistribution of land.",
  "In Srikakulam the struggle was led by a school teacher named Vempata-",
  "puSatyanarayana.Heledthetribalsinaseriesoflabourstrikes,andinseizing",
  "grain from the fields of rich farmers and redistributing it to the needy. By the",
  "end of 1967 the landlords had sought the help of the police, who came in and",
  "arrested hundreds of protesters. Satyanarayana and his men now decided to",
  "taketoarms.Thehousesoflandlordsandmoneylenderswereraidedandtheir",
  "records and papers burnt. The state\u2019s response was to send in more police; by",
  "early 1969 there were as many as nine platoons of Special Armed Police op-",
  "erating in the district.",
  "The struggle in Telengana was led by Tarimala Nagi Reddy. He was a",
  "veteranofthecommunistmovementwhohadspentyearsorganizingpeasants",
  "and also served several terms in the state legislature. Now, he proclaimed the",
  "futilityoftheparliamentarypath;resigningfromtheassemblyaswellasfrom",
  "the CPM, he took once more to the villages. He linked up with grass-roots",
  "workers in mobilizing peasants to ask for higher wages and for an end to cor-",
  "ruptionamongstateofficials.Youngmilitantsweretrainedintheuseofarms.",
  "The district was divided into zones; to each were assigned several dalams or",
  "groups of dedicated revolutionaries.13",
  "Back in West Bengal, the coalition government had fallen apart in less",
  "thanayear.President\u2019sRulewasimposedbeforefreshelectionsinearly1969saw the CPM substantially increase its tally. It won 80 seats; making it by",
  "far the biggest partner in a fresh alliance with the Bangla Congress and oth-",

  "keep the key Home portfolio and generally play Big Brother.",
  "These were years of great turmoil in the state, as captured in the titles",
  "of books written about the period such as The Agony of West Bengal and The",
  "Disinherited State.One axis of conflict was between the centre and the state.",
  "The government of India wasworried about the law-and-order situation, the",
  "rulingCongresspeevedaboutitsownlossofpowerinWestBengal.Thegov-",
  "ernor became a key player, communicating the concernsof the centre (and,",
  "less justifiably, of the Congress) to the local politicians. The assembly was",
  "disrupted regularly; on one occasion, the governor was physically prevented",
  "from delivering his customary opening address, having to flee the premises",
  "under police escort.14",
  "A second axis of conflict was between the two main parties in the state",
  "government.WhereAjoyMukherjeeandhisBanglaCongresstriedweaklyto",
  "keep the machinery of state in place, the CPM was not above stoking street",
  "protest and even violence to further its aims. In factories in and around Cal-",
  "cutta, workers took to the practice of gherao \u2013 the mobbing of their managers",
  "to demand better wages and working conditions. Previously the management",
  "hadbeenabletocallinthepolice;thenewgovernment,however,insistedthat",
  "any such stoppage of work had to be referred first to the labour minister (a",
  "CPM man). This was an invitation to strike: according to one estimate, there",
  "were more than 1,200 gheraos in the first six months of the first UF\u2013LF gov-",
  "ernment.15",
  "These stoppages created a ripple in the British press, in part because",
  "many of the great Calcutta firms were British owned, in part because this had",
  "once been the capital of the Raj. \u2018West Bengal expects more lawlessness\u2019 ran",
  "oneheadline;\u2018RiotstopsopeningofWestBengalAssembly\u2019,rananother.The",
  "response of many factory owners, Indian as well as European, was to shut",
  "down their units. Others shifted their business elsewhere, in a process of cap-",
  "ital flight that served to displace Calcutta as the leading centre of Indian in-",
  "dustry.16",
  "Apart from capitalists worried about their profits, the prevailing lawless-",
  "ness also disturbed the chief minister of West Bengal. He saw it as the handi-",
  "work of the CPM, whose ministerial portfolios included Land and Labour",
  "\u2013 where the trouble raged \u2013 and Home \u2013 where it could be controlled but",
  "wasn\u2019t. So in protest against the protests that old Gandhian Ajoy Mukherjee",
  "decided to organize a satyagraha of his own. He toured the districts, deliver-ing speeches that railed against the CPM for promoting social discord. Then,",
  "on 1 December, he began a seventy-two-hour fast in a very public place \u2013 the",
  "Curzon Park in south Calcutta. In the rich history of Indian satyagrahas, this",
  "mustsurelybecountedasthemostbizarre:achiefministerfastingagainsthis",
  "own government\u2019s failure to keep the peace.17",
  "A third axis of conflict was between the CPM and the Naxalites. The",
  "latter had now formed a new party, called the Communist Party of India",
  "(Marxist-Leninist). In district after district, cadres left the parent party to join",
  "thenewkidontheblock;justas,backin1963\u20134,theyhadlefttheCPItojoin",
  "the CPM. The rivalries between the two parties were intense; and very often",
  "violent. The leader of the CPI(ML), Charu Mazumdar, urged the elimination",
  "of landlords, who were \u2018class enemies , as well as of CPM cadres, who were",
  "\u2018rightdeviationists\u2019. Onitspart,theCPMraised aprivate army(euphemistic-",

  "of lawlessness in West Bengal\u2019; this over a mere six-week period between",
  "19 March and 4 May 1970. These were classified under different head-",

  "passes in this turbulent and tortured city\u2019, wrote one reporter, \u2018without a few",
  "bombs being hurled at police pickets and patrols\u2019. The police, for their part,",
  "raided houses and college hostels in search of the extremists. In one raid they",
  "seized explosives sufficient to make 3,000 bombs.21V",
  "Tamil pride was resurgent in the south; class warfare on the rise in the east.",
  "But the Congress consensus was crumbling elsewhere as well. In the state of",
  "Orissa the Congress had been routed by a partnership between Swatantra and",
  "the party of the local landed elite. Their election campaign had targeted two",
  "leading Congress figures, Biju Patnaik and Biren Mitra, for their alleged cor-",
  "ruption and opulent lifestyles. It was alleged that, while in power in the state,",
  "Patnaik and Mitra hadtaken bribes from businessmen and allotted lucrative",
  "government contracts to their friends and relatives.22 A popular slogan, a loc-",
  "al variant, so to say, of the one shouted in distant Dehradun, was \u2018Biju Biren",
  "kauthi/ mada botal jauthi\u2019 (Where there are liquor bottles, there you will find",
  "Biju and Biren). On coming to power, the Swatantra\u2013Jana\u2013Congress alliance",
  "immediately constituted a commission of inquiry to look into the corruption",
  "of the previous government.23",
  "Challenged by parties of left and right, the Congress also found itself",

  "At another level, the SVD governments were simply the product of per-",
  "sonal ambition. Consider the state of Madhya Pradesh. Here, the Congress\u2019s",
  "troubles started before the election, when the Rajmata (queen mother) of",
  "Gwalior left the party because she had not been consulted in the choice of",
  "candidates.WithhersonMadhavraoshecampaignedenergeticallyagainstthe",
  "Congress. An intelligence report claimed the Rajmata spent Rs3 million dur-",
  "ing the election. Although the Congress came back to power, in the Gwali-",
  "or region the party was wiped out. Now, claimed the report, the Rajmata was",
  "planning to spend more money \u2018to subvert the loyalties of some Congress le-",
  "gislators . . . [and] bring about the downfall of the new Congress Ministry\u2019.24",
  "The chief minister, a canny operator named D. P. Mishra, was quite pre-",
  "pared for this. He was wooing defectors from other parties himself \u2013 as he",
  "wrote to the Congress president, he had \u2018to open the door for all who wish",
  "to join the Party\u2019.25 Eventually, though, the Rajmata was successful, when the",
  "prominent Congress defector Govind Narain Singh got twenty-eight others to",
  "leave the party with him. Before the crucial vote in the House, Singh kept his",

  "kidnapped or otherwise seduced.",
  "Not sure how long their tenure would last, the SVD government had to",
  "make every day count. Or every order, rather. Ministers specified a fee for",
  "sanctioning or stopping transfers of officials. Thus \u2018orders, particularly trans-",
  "fer orders, were issued and cancelled with bewildering rapidity\u2019. Character-",
  "istically, the Jana Sangh wanted the Education portfolio, so that \u2018they could",
  "build up a permanent following through the primary schools\u2019. They eventu-",
  "ally got Home, where they maintained the communal peace by keeping their",
  "followers in check, yet took great care \u2018to see that no key post in any depart-",
  "ment went to a Muslim\u2019.26",
  "Despite the defections and the corruptions they engendered, what tran-",
  "spired after the 1967 elections was indeed what E. P. W. da Costa had called",
  "it \u2013 India\u2019s second non-violent revolution. One could now take a train from",
  "New Delhi to Calcutta, a journey of 1,000 miles right through the country\u2019s",
  "heartland, and not pass through a single Congress-ruled state.",
  "VIThe late 1960s saw a fresh assertion of regionalist sentiment. Parts of the",
  "old Hyderabad state, merged with Andhra Pradesh in 1956, now wanted out.",
  "The movement was led by students of the Osmania University, who com-",
  "plained that Andhra was run for the benefit of the coastal elite. The new state",
  "they demanded would centre on the neglected inland districts. To be named",
  "Telengana, it would have Hyderabad as its capital. Strikes and processions",
  "were held, trains stopped and claims advanced of \u2018colonization by Andhras\u2019",
  "and \u2018police zulm\u2019 (terror).27",
  "Across the country a new state had in fact been created, out of the tribal",
  "districts of Assam. The movement here had a long history. An Eastern Indi-",
  "an Tribal Union was formed in 1955 to represent the inhabitants of the Khasi,",
  "JaintiaandGarohills.FiveyearslateritwasrenamedtheAll-PartyHillLead-",
  "ers Conference (APHLC). In the 1967 elections the Congress was routed in",
  "the hills by the APHLC. This, along with the fear of stoking an insurgency",
  "on the Naga and Mizo pattern, prompted the centre to create a new province",
  "in December 1969. The state was called Meghalaya, meaning abode of the",
  "clouds.28",
  "In Punjab, meanwhile, an existing state was in search of a capital of",
  "its own. After the state\u2019s division in 1966, Chandigarh served as the capital",
  "of both Punjab and Haryana. The Sikhs believed, with reason, that the city",
  "should be reserved to them \u2013 indeed, the centre had indicated that it would.",
  "Now the Punjabis were urging the government to make good their promise.",
  "Through 1968 and 1969 there were popular demonstrations to this effect. In",
  "October 1969 the veteran freedom fighter Darshan Singh Pherumal died after",
  "a fast aimed at making New Delhi hand over Chandigarh. The prime minister",
  "issued an anodyne note of sympathy: she hoped that Pherumal\u2019s death would",
  "\u2018move the people of Punjab and of Haryana towards bringing their hearts and",
  "minds together in an act of great reconciliation\u2019.29",
  "JustastheSikhswantedChandigarhexclusivelyforthemselves,so,with",

  "party, named the Shiv Sena after the great medieval Maratha warrior Shivaji.",

  "\u2013 albeit in a more extreme form. Instead of \u2018Bombay for Maharashtra the",

  "Bombay was India\u2019s urbs prima; its financial and industrial capital, and",
  "the centre of its entertainment industry. In this most cosmopolitan of cities, a",
  "nativist agenda proved surprisingly successful, being especially attractive to",
  "the educated unemployed. In 1968 the Sena won as many as 42 seats in the",
  "Bombay municipal elections, standing second only to the Congress.30",

  "to be put under UN trusteeship for five years, after which it would vote on",

  "the Sheikh was, just as characteristically, direct in his defence of secularism.",
  "When a dispute between students threatened to escalate into a Hindu-Muslim",

  "Onereasonforthissuddenupsurgeinviolencewastheweaknessofstate",
  "governments. Particularly culpable were the SVD regimes, who vacillated in",
  "using force to quell riots or rioters. Another reason was that, in the aftermath",
  "of the war of 1965, feelings against Pakistan ran high. These could easily be",
  "turned against Indian Muslims, seen (unfairly) as fifth columnists working on",
  "behalf of the enemy. \u2018Jana Sangh-inspired Hindus\u2019 were particularly prone to",
  "taunting Muslims in this fashion. Now, when a dispute broke out, to the old,",
  "religiouslyinspiredslogans\u2013\u2018HarHarMahadev\u2019and\u2018AllahOAkbar\u2019\u2013was",

  "or else we will send you to your grave).37",

  "temple with cows. Hot words were exchanged, whereupon Muslim youths",
  "entered the temple and smashed a few idols. A Muslim delegation, led by a",
  "respected lawyer, went immediately to apologize, but the priests were not to",
  "be pacified. As word spread of the desecration, crowds of Hindus began col-",
  "lecting, looking for targets to attack. Qurans were burnt in one place, Muslim",
  "shops attacked in another. With the Muslims fighting back, the trouble spread",
  "through the city and, in time, to towns near Ahmedabad as well. As the po-",

  "In 1967\u20138, when the communal temperature began to rise, India had a",
  "Muslim president (Dr Zakir Hussain) as well as a Muslim chief justice of the",
  "Supreme Court (M. Hidayatullah). However, as a Delhi journal pointed out,",
  "thiswasbynomeansrepresentativeof\u2018thepositionofMuslimsinthetotality",
  "of Indian life\u2019. They were seriously under-represented in professions such as",
  "engineering and medicine, and in industry, trade and the armed forces. This",
  "was in part because of the flight of the Muslim upper crust to Pakistan, yet",
  "subtle social prejudice also contributed. The Muslims had long stood solidly",
  "behind the Congress, but in the elections of 1967 they voted in large numbers",
  "for other parties as a way of showing their disillusionment. The Muslim pre-dicament was a product of bigotry and communal politics on the Hindu side,",
  "and of an obscurantist leadership on their own.40",
  "VII",
  "To the historian, the late 1960s are reminiscent of the late 1940s, likewise a",
  "time of crisis and conflict, of resentment along lines of class, religion, ethni-",
  "city and region, of a centre that seemed barely to hold. I wonder if these par-",
  "allels occurred to the Indians who lived through these times, to people in au-",
  "thority in particular, and to the prime minister most of all.",
  "Theresonanceswerenotmerelynationalorsociological,butalsofamili-",
  "al. With the Raj in its death throes, Jawaharlal Nehru became prime minis-",
  "ter of an interim government in 1946; the next year, the post became more",
  "substantial when India became independent. Indira Gandhi was unexpectedly",
  "thrustintoofficein1966;thenextyear,thejobwasconfirmedformallywhen",
  "she led her party to an election victory. Like Nehru, she was in control in",
  "Delhi; like him, she could not be certain how far her government\u2019s writ ran",
  "beyond it. He and she had both to contend with communist insurrection and",
  "communalconflict;hewasadditionallyfacedwiththeproblemoftheprincely",
  "states, she with the problem of a dozen anti-Congress state governments.",
  "Heretheparallelsend.SeekingtouniteadividedIndia,Nehruarticulated",
  "an ideology that rested on four main pillars. First, there was democracy, the",
  "freedomtochooseone\u2019sfriendsandspeakone\u2019smind(andinthelanguageof",
  "one\u2019schoice)\u2013aboveall,thefreedomtochooseone\u2019sleadersthroughregular",

  "neutralityofthestateinmattersofreligionanditscommitmenttomaintaining",
  "social peace. Third, there was socialism, the attempt to augment productivity",
  "while ensuring a more egalitarian distribution of income (and of social op-",
  "portunity). Fourth, there was non-alignment, the placement of India beyond",
  "and above the rivalries of the Great Powers. Among the less compelling, but",
  "notnecessarilylesssignificant,elementsofthisworldviewweretheconscious",
  "cultivationofamultipartysystem(notablythroughdebateinParliament),and",
  "a respect for the autonomy of the judiciary and the executive.",
  "AlthoughrearticulatedinthecontextofanewlyindependentIndia,these",
  "beliefs had been developing over a period of more than twenty years. Nehru",
  "was a well-read and widely travelled man. Through his travels and readings,",
  "he arrived at a synthesis of socialism and liberalism that he thought appropri-ate to his country. In other words, the political beliefs he came to profess \u2013",
  "and invited the people of India to share \u2013 were his own.",
  "With Mrs Gandhi one cannot be so sure. She had neither read nor trav-",
  "elled extensively. She was unquestionably a patriot; growing up in the free-",
  "dom movement, and with its leaders, she was deeply committed to upholding",
  "India\u2019sinterestsintheworld.Howshethoughtthesecouldbestbeupheldwas",
  "less certain. In all the years she had been in politics her core beliefs had not",

  "which Mrs Gandhi, before 1967, spoke scarcely a word.",
  "The prime minister was, so to say, non-ideological \u2013 an attribute not",
  "shared by her advisers. The chief among these was her principal secretary, P.",

  "dits \u2013 and many common friends.",
  "Haksar was a kind of polymath: a student of mathematics, he was also",
  "keenly interested in history, particularly diplomatic and military history.",
  "Among his other interests were anthropology \u2013 he had attended Bronislaw",
  "Malinowski\u2019s seminar at the LSE \u2013 and food (he was a superb cook). Haksar",
  "tended to overpower friends and colleagues with the range of his knowledge",
  "andthevigourofhisopinions.However,inthiscaseintellectualforcewasnot",
  "necessarily matched by intellectual subtlety. His political views were those of",
  "the left wing of the British Labour Party, circa 1945 \u2013 pro-state and anti-mar-",
  "ket in economic affairs, pro-Soviet and anti-American in foreign policy. He",
  "was also \u2013 it must be added \u2013 a man of an unshakeable integrity.41",

  "diplomat T. N. Kaul, the politician turned diplomat D. P. Dhar, the economist",
  "turned mandarin P. N. Dhar and the policeman turned security analyst R. N.Kao. Collectively they were known (behind their backs) as the \u2018Panch Pan-",

  "wereKashmiriBrahmins.Therewasalsoanoutercoreofadvisers,theselike-",
  "wise officials or intellectuals rather than politicians per se.",
  "This was not accidental. Even more so than Lal Bahadur Shastri, Mrs",
  "Gandhi needed to assert her independence of the Congress \u2018Syndicate\u2019 which",
  "had chosen her. Socially, she shared little with the party bosses \u2013her own",
  "friends came from a more rarefied milieu. She could not be certain when they",
  "might try to unseat her. Thus she came to rely on the advice of the mandar-",
  "ins around her, who had no political ambitions themselves. But they did have",
  "political views to which, in time and for her own reasons, she came to sub-",
  "scribe.",
  "IX",
  "Aftertheelectionsof1967,MorarjiDesaioncemoremademanifesthisdesire",
  "to become prime minister. A compromise was worked out under which he",
  "would serve as finance minister and deputy prime minister \u2013 the latter a post",
  "that no one had held since the death of Vallabhbhai Patel.",
  "Hemmed in by the Syndicate, and threatened by Desai, the prime min-",
  "ister now sought to mark out her own identity by presenting herself as a so-",
  "cialist. This was done on the advice of P. N. Haksar. In a note he prepared for",
  "her in January 1968, the mandarin advised his mistress to clip Desai\u2019s wings,",
  "perhaps by appointing one or two other \u2018deputy\u2019 prime ministers in addition.",
  "While choosing ministers loyal to her, the prime minister had also to forge",
  "\u2018wider progressive alliances under [her] more effective personal lead\u2019. For",
  "this, she needed to \u2018project more assertively [her] own ideological image dir-",
  "ectly to the people over the heads of [her] colleagues and party men\u2019.43",
  "Mrs Gandhi had rarely invoked the word \u2018socialist\u2019 before 1967, al-",
  "though it was one of the four pillars of her father\u2019s political philosophy. Not-",
  "ably, it was the pillar that was propped up most enthusiastically by her man-",
  "darins. In part, the appeal was negative, stemming from a Brahmanical dis-",
  "taste for business and businessmen. But there was also a positive identifica-",
  "tion with the idea of socialism. A greater role for the state in the economy,",
  "they believed, was necessary to ensure social equity as well as promote na-",
  "tional integration. The public sector, wrote one mandarin, was \u2018a macrocosm",

  "for forging a united and integrated India\u2019.44",
  "There was a strong moral core to the socialism of P. N. Haksar and",
  "his colleagues. For the prime minister, however, the appeal was pragmatic, a",
  "means of distinguishing herself from the Congress old guard. In May 1967",
  "she presented a ten-point programme of reform to the party, which included",
  "the\u2018socialcontrol\u2019ofbanking,theabolitionoftheprivypursesofprincesand",
  "guaranteedminimumwagesforruralandindustriallabour.TheSyndicatewas",
  "unenthusiastic, but the programme appealed to the younger generation, who",
  "saw the party\u2019s recent reverses as a consequence of the promises unfulfilled",
  "over the years.45",
  "SpeechesmadebyMrsGandhiafterherre-election showheridentifying",

  "that it was not making profit (her answer that it did not need to, since it was",
  "building a base for economic development). Speaking to the Rajya Sabha in",
  "August, she asked for a \u2018new deal for the down-trodden\u2019, in particular, the",
  "Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, pledging her \u2018unceasing attention",
  "and effort to this cause\u2019. A few days later, in her Independence Day address",
  "from the ramparts of the Red Fort, she singled out \u2018industrialists and busi-",

  "Throughout 1968 and 1969, writes one biographer, Mrs Gandhi was a",

  "In a statement to the press, the prime minister claimed that there was \u2018a",

  "people supported it, with only big newspapers representing commercial in-",

  "that this might be an individual quest masquerading as an ideological battle.",
  "Mrs Gandhi had \u2018chosen to adopt a radical stance suddenly as a tactic in the",
  "personal strife for dominance within the Congress party\u2019, said Thought; she",
  "now wished to \u2018project herself as a national figure who needs the Congress",
  "less than it needs her\u2019.52",
  "The nationalization of banks was challenged in the Supreme Court; the",
  "challengewasupheld,butthejudgementwasimmediatelynullifiedbyafresh",

  "first six months of state control there was a massive expansion in the bank-",

  "of Parliament and state assemblies would vote. The official Congress candid-",
  "ate was Sanjiva Reddy. V. V. Giri had decided to contest as an independent,",
  "while the opposition had put up C. D. Deshmukh, a former civil servant",
  "and Cabinet Minister. In violation of party practice and party discipline, the",
  "prime minister decided she would support V. V. Giri. This decision was not",
  "made public, but it was conveyed to her followers, who went around can-",
  "vassing the younger Congress MPs to vote for Giri. The Congress president,",
  "S. Nijalingappa, now pressed the prime minister to issue a public declaration",
  "of support for Reddy. When she wouldn\u2019t, he spoke to the Jana Sangh and",
  "Swatantra leaders asking them to shift their own allegiance from Subba Rao",
  "to Reddy. This move was seized upon by Mrs Gandhi\u2019s camp, who accused",
  "Nijalingappa of hobnobbing with the enemy. They \u2018requisitioned\u2019 a meeting",
  "of the AICC to discuss the matter. The request was refused.",
  "Four days before the presidential elections \u2013 due on 20 August 1969 \u2013",
  "Mrs Gandhi finally spoke. She asked for a \u2018vote of conscience\u2019. This was a",
  "call to Congress Party members to defy their organization and vote for the",
  "rival candidate. Which they did, in fairly large numbers. Many of the older",

  "commenced a bitter exchange of letters between the Congress president and",
  "the prime minister. Finally, on 12 November, Mrs Gandhi was expelled from",
  "the Congress for \u2018indiscipline\u2019. By this time many MPs had thrown in their",
  "lot with her. In December rival Congress sessions were held, the parent body",
  "meeting in Ahmedabad and its new challenger in Bombay. The parties were",
  "becoming known as Congress (O) and Congress (R). The letters stood in one",
  "version for \u2018Organization\u2019 and \u2018Requisitionist\u2019, in another for \u2018Old\u2019 and \u2018Re-",

  "The history of the twentieth century, he pointed out,is replete with instances of the tragedy that overtakes democracy when a",
  "leader who has risen to power on the crest of a popular wave or with the",
  "support of a democratic organisation becomes a victim of political nar-",
  "cissismandiseggedonbyacoterieofunscrupuloussycophantswhouse",
  "corruption and terror to silence opposition and attempt to make public",
  "opinion an echo of authority. The Congress as an organisation dedicated",
  "to democracy and socialism has to combat such trends.55",
  "Nijalingappa was a lifelong Congressman, a man from peasant stock who",
  "joined the freedom movement when he was very young. He built up the party",
  "in Mysore, later serving three terms as the state\u2019s chief minister.56 About his",
  "commitment to the party and to democracy there could be no question. But",
  "\u2018socialism was another matter. The nationalization of banks had strengthened",
  "his rival\u2019s claim to that label, while Nijalingappa\u2019s wooing of the Jana Sangh",
  "and Swatantra had weakened his own. This contrast was assiduously deve-",
  "loped in the speeches and letters that bore Mrs Gandhi\u2019s name, but were the",
  "handiwork of P. N. Haksar and his colleagues. Here, the prime minister was",
  "presented asstanding forsocialism ineconomics andsecularism inmatters of",
  "religion, as being pro-poor and for the development of the nation as a whole.",
  "ThePartypresident,ontheotherhand,wassaidtobepromotingcapitalismin",
  "economics and communalism in religion.57",
  "The presentation was markedly successful. Of the 705 members of the",
  "AICC,asmanyas446attendedtheCongress(R)session;ofthe429Congress",
  "MPs (in both Houses), 310 joined the prime minister\u2019s camp. Of these, 220",
  "were from the Lok Sabha, leaving the Congress (R) some forty-five seats",
  "short of a majority. To makeup the numbers it turned to independents and",
  "to the Communist Party of India. The CPI was delighted to join up, seeing",
  "Mrs Gandhi\u2019s left turn as an opportunity for expanding its own influence. In",
  "August 1969, writing of the battle within the Congress, an influential journal-",
  "ist close to the CPI crowed that \u2018the Syndicate pretensions have been torn to",
  "pieces\u2019. \u2018A tide has come in the affairs of the nation\u2019, he wrote, \u2018and there is",
  "little doubt that . . . Indira Gandhi is taking it at the flood . . . The tide is sym-",
  "bolised by the enthusiastic crowds from different walks of life that have been",
  "flocking to the Prime Minister\u2019s Houseevery day. This is no ordinary craving",
  "for darshan of a beautiful face; they represent a new assertion of the power",
  "of the demos.\u2019 The journalist now looked forward to the \u2018implementation of a",
  "radical economic agenda and [a] firm stand against communalism\u2019.58In a comparable situation, back in 1950\u20132, Jawaharlal Nehru had bided",
  "his time. Faced with the conservative challenge of Tandon and company, he",
  "hadworkedtogethiswaywiththepartyratherthandivideitintwo.Buthere,",
  "as one knowledgeable observer remarked, Mrs Gandhi had \u2018displayed a mil-",
  "itancy foreign to Congress tradition\u2019. In contrast to the incremental approach",
  "of Nehru and Shastri, she \u2018represented something ruthless and new. She had",
  "astonished people with her flair for cold assessment, shrewd timing, and the",
  "telling theatrical gesture; above all, with her capacity for a fight to the finish,",
  "even to bringing the eighty-four-year-old party of liberation to rupture\u2019.59",
  "XI",
  "With the banks nationalized, Mrs Gandhi now turned to the abolition of the",
  "privilegesoftheprinces.WhentheirstatesmergedwiththeUnion,theprinces",
  "were given a constitutional guarantee that they could retain their titles, jewels",
  "and palaces, be paid an annual privy purse in proportion to the size of their",

  "ans so poor, it was felt that these privileges were \u2018out of place and out of time",
  "\u2013 these the words of P. N. Haksar, but widely endorsed within and outside his",
  "circle.60",
  "As early as July 1967 the AICC passed a resolution asking for an end to",
  "titles and privy purses. The Home Ministry prepared a detailed note, recom-",
  "mending action via legislation rather than executive action. The home min-",
  "ister, Y. B. Chavan, was asked to commence negotiations with the princes,",
  "represented in these talks by the Maharaja of Dhrangadhara. It was hoped the",
  "princes would be amenable to the change; if not, a constitutional amendment",
  "would have to be brought.61",
  "Chavan and Dhrangadhara had several long meetings in 1968, but no",
  "compromisecouldbereached.Inanycase,thepowerstrugglewithintheCon-",

  "continued to talk, each side proving as obdurate as the other. At this stage, in",
  "December 1969, the Jam Saheb of Nawanagar sent New Delhi an intriguing",
  "proposal. This criticized both parties, the princes for adopting \u2018a most adam-",
  "antly uncompromising stand\u2019, the government for \u2018going back on their [con-",
  "stitutional] commitments andassurances\u2019. TheJamSahebsuggested, asawayoutoftheimpasse,thatthegovernmentabolishtheprincesprivileges,butpay",

  "TheJamSahebthoughtthisascheme that \u2018wouldbefit thedignity ofthe",
  "nation\u2019. Mrs Gandhi passed it on to the home minister, noting that it was \u2018an-",
  "imated by a constructive purpose\u2019. But nothing came of it. On 18 May 1970",
  "\u2013 the last day of the summer session of Parliament \u2013 Y. B. Chavan introduced",
  "a bill calling for a constitutional amendment annulling the privileges of the",
  "princes.Thebillwastakenupinthenextsession,whenMrsGandhidescribed",

  "TheLokSabhaadoptedthebillbythenecessarytwo-thirdsmargin\u2013336",
  "for, 155 against. However, in the Rajya Sabha the motion failed to be carried",
  "by a single vote. The prime minister had apparently anticipated this adverse",
  "vote in the Upper House, for soon afterwards a presidential order was issued",
  "derecognizing the princes.",
  "Four days later, on 11 September 1970, a group of Maharajas moved the",
  "Supreme Court against the order. The case was heard by a full bench, headed",
  "by the chief justice. On 11 December the bench ruled that the order was ar-",
  "bitrary and against the spirit of the constitution. Some legal scholars viewed",
  "the judgement as a victory for democracy, whereas left-wing radicals saw it",
  "as consistent with the \u2018tendency of the Supreme Court to protect the vested",
  "interests\u2019.",
  "With regard to bank nationalization, too, the Court had put a spanner in",
  "the works. This fresh challenge to her authority prompted the prime minis-",
  "ter to dissolve Parliament and call for a fresh mandate from the people. The",
  "House still had a year to run. Explaining the decision over All-India Radio,",
  "MrsGandhisaidthat while hergovernment hadsoughtto\u2018ensureabetter life",

  "a bad drought, which particularly affected the state of Bihar, but the next year",
  "saw a bumper crop of food grains, 95 million tonnes (mt) in all. Much of",

  "elected politicians by soldiers in uniform. Army rule was out of the question,",
  "but there was yet the prospect of an armed communist movement engulfing",
  "large parts of the country. The Green Revolution could turn Red, for agricul-",

  "which saw, as \u2018the most hopeful way forward for India\u2019, a \u2018revolutionary",
