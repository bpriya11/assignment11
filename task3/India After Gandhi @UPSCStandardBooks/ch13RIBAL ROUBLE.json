  "ive since the mid nineteenth century, successfully converting several tribes to",
  "Christianity.",
  "At this time the Naga hills formed part of Assam, a province very diverse",
  "even by Indian standards, sharing borders with China, Burma and East",
  "Pakistan,dividedintouplandandlowlandregionsandinhabitedbyhundredsof",
  "different communities. In the plains lived Assamese-speaking Hindus, connec-",
  "ted by culture and faith to the greater Indian heartland. Among the important",
  "groups of tribes were the Mizos, the Khasis, the Garos, and the Jaintias, who",
  "took (or gave) their names to the mountain ranges in which they lived. Also in",
  "the region were two princely states, Tripura and Manipur, whose populations",
  "were likewise mixed, part Hindu and part tribal.",
  "Among the tribes of north-east India the Nagas were perhaps the most",
  "autonomous.TheirterritorylayontheIndo-Burmeseborder-indeed,therewere",
  "almost as many Nagas in Burma as in India. Some Nagas had contact withHindu villages in Assam, to whom they sold rice in exchange for salt. Yet the",
  "Nagas had been totally outside the fold of the Congress-led national move-",
  "ment. There had been no satyagraha here, no civil disobedience \u2013 in fact, not",
  "one Gandhian leader in a white cap had ever visited these hills. Some tribes",
  "had fiercely fought the British, but over time the two sides had come to view",
  "each other with mutual respect. For their part, the British affected a certain",
  "paternalism, wishing to \u2018protect their wards from the corrosive corruptions of",
  "the modern world.",
  "The Naga question really dates to 1946, the year the fate of British India",
  "was being decided in those high centres of imperial power, New Delhi and",
  "Simla. As elections were held across India, as the Cabinet Mission came and",
  "went, as the viceroy went into conclave with leaders of the Congress and the",
  "Muslim League, in their own obscure corner of the subcontinent some Na-",
  "gas began to worry about their future. In January 1946 a group who were",
  "\u2018educated Christians and spoke expressive English formed the Naga Nation-",
  "al Council, or NNC. This had the classic trappings of a nationalist movement",
  "in embryo: led by middle-class intellectuals, their ideas were promoted in a",
  "journal of their own, called The Naga Nation, 250 copies of which were mi-",
  "meographed and distributed through the Naga country.1",
  "The NNC stood for the unity of all Nagas, and for their \u2018self-determin-",
  "ation\u2019, a term which, here as elsewhere, was open to multiple and sometimes",
  "mutually contradictory meanings. The Angami Nagas, with their honourable",
  "martial tradition and record of fighting all outsiders (the British included),",
  "thoughtitshouldmeanafullyindependentstate:\u2018agovernmentoftheNagas,",
  "for the Nagas, by the Nagas\u2019. On the other hand, the Aos, who were more",
  "moderate, thought they could live with dignity within India, so long as their",
  "land and customs were protected and they had the autonomy to frame and en-",
  "force their own laws.",
  "The early meetings of the NNC witnessed a vigorous debate between",
  "these two factions which spilled over into the pages of the Naga Nation. A",

  "otherparts ofthecountrywhomight gothere toexploit them totheir ownad-",

  "according to our own genius and taste. We shall enjoy home rule in our coun-",

  "The radicals, however, still stood out for complete independence. In this",

  "of the north-east be constituted as a \u2018Crown colony\u2019, ruled directly from Lon-",
  "don, and not linked in anyway to the soon-to-be independent nation of India.3",
  "Others advised their wards that they should strike out for independence, as",
  "the state of India would soon break up anyway. As the Superintendent of the",
  "Lushai hills wrote in March 1947,",
  "My advice to the Lushais, since the very beginning of Lushai politics at",

  "I would not encourage my small daughter to commit herself to vows of",

  "In June1947 a delegation of the NNC met the governor of Assam, Sir Akbar",
  "Hydari, to discuss the terms by which the Nagas could join India. The two",
  "sides agreed that tribal land would not be alienated to outsiders, that Naga re-",
  "ligious practices would not be affected and that the NNC would have a say",
  "in the staffing of government offices. Next, an NNC delegation went to Del-",
  "hi, where they met Nehru, who once more told them that they could have",
  "autonomy but not independence. They also called on Mahatma Gandhi, in a",
  "meeting of which many versions have circulated down the years. In one ver-",
  "sion,GandhitoldtheNagasthattheycoulddeclaretheirindependenceifthey",
  "wished; that no one could compel them to join India; and that if New Delhi",
  "sent in the army, Gandhi himself would come to the Naga hills to resist it. He",
  "apparently said, \u2018I will ask them to shoot me first before one Naga is shot.\u20195The version printed in the Collected Works of Mahatma Gandhi is less dra-",
  "matic;here,Gandhiisreportedassaying,\u2018Personally,Ibelieveyouallbelong",

  "\u2018Learn all the handicrafts\u2019, said the Mahatma, \u2018that\u2019s the way to peaceful in-",
  "dependence. If you use rifles and guns and tanks, it is a foolish thing.\u20196",
  "The most vocal spokesmen for independence were the Angamis from",
  "Khonomah, a village which, back in 1879\u201380, had fought the British army",
  "to a standstill and whose residents were \u2018known and feared\u2019 across the Naga",
  "hills.7 A faction styling itself the Peoples\u2019 Independence League was putting",
  "up posters calling for complete independence, in terms borrowed (with ac-",
  "knowledgement) from American freedom fighters: \u2018It is my living sentiment,",
  "and by the blessing of God it shall be my dying sentiment \u2013 Independence",

  "me death!\u2019 (Patrick Henry).8",
  "Meanwhile,theBritishRajdepartedfromNewDelhiandthenewIndian",
  "state began to consolidate itself. The secretary to the governor of Assam told",
  "the Nagas that they were too few to successfully rebel against a nation of 300",

  "The parable did not go down well with the educated Nagas. \u2018Bones,",

  "However, the same warning was issued in more palatable form by Charles",

  "IIAs the Naga intelligentsia was struggling to define its \u2018independence\u2019, the",
  "Constituent Assembly of India was meeting in New Delhi. Among the topics",
  "for discussion was the place of tribals in a free and democratic India. On 30",
  "July 1947 Jaipal Singh informed the Assembly of \u2018some very unhappy devel-",
  "opments\u2019 which were brewing in the Naga hills. Jaipal had been receiving \u2018a",
  "telegram per day\u2019, the \u2018latest telegram becoming more confounded than the",
  "previous one. Each one seems to go one step further into the wilderness.\u2019 As",
  "he saw it, the Nagas had been \u2018misguided\u2019 into the belief that their status was",
  "akin to that of the princes, and that like them they could reclaim their sov-",
  "ereignty once the British left. When the Naga delegation had come to Delhi",
  "to meet Nehru and Gandhi, they had also met Jaipal, who apprised them of",
  "the \u2018blunt fact that \u2018the Naga Hills have always been part of India. Therefore,",
  "there is no question of secession.\u201910",
  "Jaipal Singh was, of course, a tribal himself, one of several million such",
  "whose homes lay in the hilly and forest belt that ran right across the heart of",
  "peninsularIndia.Knownas\u2018adivasis\u2019(originalinhabitants),thecentralIndian",
  "tribals were somewhat different from those that dwelt in the north-east. Like",
  "them, they were chiefly subsistence agriculturists who depended heavily on",
  "the forests for sustenance. Like them, they had no caste system and were or-",
  "ganized in clans; like them, they manifested far less gender inequality than in",
  "supposedly more \u2018advanced parts of the country. However, unlike the Nagas",
  "and their neighbours, the tribes of central India had long-standing relations",
  "with Hindu peasant society. They exchanged goods and services, sometimes",
  "worshipped the same Gods and had historically been part of the same king-",
  "doms.",
  "These relations had not been uncontentious. With British rule, the areas",
  "inhabited by tribes had been opened up to commercialization and coloniza-",
  "tion. The forests they lived in suddenly acquired a market value; so did the",
  "rivers that ran through them and the minerals that lay beneath them. Some",
  "parts remained untouched, but elsewhere the tribals were deprived of access",
  "to forests, dispossessed of their lands and placed in debt to money lenders.",
  "The \u2018outsider\u2019 was increasingly seen as one who was seeking to usurp the re-",
  "sources of the adivasis. In the Chotanagpur plateau, for example, the non-tri-",
  "bal was known as diku, a term that evoked fear as well as resentment.11",
  "The Constituent Assembly recognized this vulnerability, and spent days",
  "debating what to do about it. Ultimately, it decided to designate some 400",
  "communities as \u2018scheduled tribes\u2019. These constituted about 7 per cent of the",
  "population,andhadseatsreservedfortheminthelegislatureaswellasingov-",
  "ernment departments. Schedule V of the constitution pertained to the tribesthat lived in central India; it allowed for the creation of tribal advisory coun-",
  "cils and for curbs on moneylending and on the sale of tribal land to outsiders.",
  "Schedule VI pertained to the tribes of the north-east; it gestured further in the",
  "direction of local autonomy, constituting district and regional councils, pro-",
  "tecting local rights in land, forests and waterways and instructing state gov-",
  "ernments to share mining revenues with the local council, a concession not",
  "granted anywhere else in India.",
  "Jaipal Singh thought that these provisions would have real teeth only if",
  "thetribalscouldcometoforgeaseparatestatewithintheUnion.Hecalledthis",
  "putativestateJharkhand;inhisvisionitwouldincorporatehisownChotanag-",
  "pur plateau, then in Bihar, along with contiguous tribal areas located in the",
  "provinces of Bengal and Orissa. The proposed state would cover an area of",
  "some 48,000 square miles and have a population of 12 million people.12 The",
  "idea caught the imagination of the youth of Chotanagpur. Thus, in May 1947,",
  "the Adivasi Sabha of Jamshedpur wrote to Nehru, Gandhi and the Constitu-",
  "ent Assembly urging the creation of a Jharkhand state out of Bihar. \u2018We want",
  "Jharkhand Province to preserve and develop Adivasi Culture and Language\u2019,",
  "said their memorandum, \u2018to make our customary law supreme, to make our",
  "lands inalienable, and above all to save ourselves from continuous exploita-",
  "tion.\u201913",
  "In February 1948 Jaipal Singh delivered the presidential address to the",
  "All-India Adivasi Mahasabha, an organization that he had led since its incep-",
  "tion a decade previously. He spoke here of how, after Independence, \u2018Bihari",
  "imperialism\u2019 had replaced \u2018British imperialism\u2019 as the greatest problem for",
  "the adivasi. He identified the land question as the most crucial, and urged the",
  "speedy creation of a Jharkhand state. Notably, he simultaneously underlined",
  "hiscommitmenttotheIndianUnionbyspeakingwithfeelingaboutthe\u2018tragic",
  "assassination of Gan-dhiji\u2019, and by raising a slogan that combined local pride",
  "with a wider Indian patriotism: \u2018Jai Jharkhand! Jai Adivasi! Jai Hind!\u201914",

  "cess beyond its own imaginings, winning three seats to Parliament and thirty-",
  "three to the state\u2019s Assembly. These victories all came in the tribal regions of",
  "Bihar, where it comprehensively trounced the ruling Congress Party. At the",
  "polls at any rate, the case for Jharkhand had been proved.III",
  "Jaipal Singh and his Jharkhand Party offered one prospective path for the tri-",
  "bals: autonomy within the Indian Union, safeguarded by laws protecting their",
  "landandcustomsandbythecreationofaprovinceinregionswherethetribals",
  "were in a majority. The Naga radicals offered another: an independent, sov-",
  "ereign state carved out of India and quite distinct from it. Among the Nagas",
  "this view was upheld most insistently by the Angamis and, among them, by a",
  "certainresidentofKhonomahvillage,yetanotherofthoseremarkablemakers",
  "of Indian history who is still to find his biographer.",
  "The man in question was Angami Zapu Phizo, with whose name the",
  "Naga cause was to be identified for close to half a century. Born in 1913,",
  "Phizo was fair and slightly built, his face horribly twisted following a child-",
  "hood paralytic attack. Educated by the Baptists, and a poet of sorts \u2013 among",
  "his compositions was a \u2018Naga National Anthem\u2019 \u2013 he sold insurance for a",

  "delegation that met Mahatma Gandhi in New Delhi in July 1947. Three years",
  "later he was elected president of the NNC and committed the Nagas to \u2018full",
  "Independence\u2019. He quelled the doubters and nay-sayers, who wanted an ac-",
  "commodation with India. Many young Nagas were willing to go all the way",
  "with Phizo. Travelling in the area in December 1950, the Quaker Horace Al-",
  "exander met two NNC members whose \u2018minds are obsessed with the word",
  "\u201cindependence\u201d, and I do not believe that any amount of argument or appeals",
  "to the [Indian] constitution, still less any threat, will shake them out of it\u2019.16",

  "cises in totalitarian states, where, for example, 99.99 per cent of the Russian",
  "people are said to have endorsed Stalin as Supreme Leader. Still, there is nodoubt that Phizo himself wanted independence, and so did numerous of his",
  "followers.",

  "the wheels of history\u2019. He told them that \u2018the Nagas were as free as any In-",
  "dian\u2019, and under the constitution they had \u2018a very large degree of autonomy",
  "in managing their own affairs\u2019. He invited Phizo and his men to \u2018submit pro-",

  "said, \u2018we will continue our struggle for independence, and one day we shall",
  "meet [Nehru] again for a friendly settlement\u2019 (as representatives of a separate",
  "nation). The free state he had in mind would bring together 200,000 Nagas in",
  "India, another 200,000 in what he called \u2018no-man\u2019s land\u2019, and 400,000 who",
  "were presently citizens of Burma.19",
  "Afterwards the Jharkhand leader Jaipal Singh hosted a lunch for Phizo",

  "1954 things took a turn decidedly for the worse. In the spring of that year anarmy officer riding a motorcycle in Kohimah accidentally knocked down a",

  "abandoned, and preparations made for an armed uprising. The rebels began",
  "transporting weapons to a safe haven in the Tuensang area. In June 1954 the",
  "Assam Rifles attacked a village believed to be sympathetic to the guerrillas.",
  "In September some rebels declared the formation of a \u2018federal government of",
  "Nagaland\u2019.",
  "By now killings and counter-killings were occurring with fair regularity.",
  "There were villages loyal to the government which were targeted by the",
  "rebels; villages sympathetic to the freedom struggle which were attacked by",

  "Naga leader returned to the jungle. However, one of his key aides, T. Sakhrie,",
  "had come round to the view that the Nagas could not ever hope to defeat the",
  "Indian army. Having made their point, the NNC guerrillas should lay down",
  "their weapons and their leaders seek an honourable settlement with the gov-",
  "ernment in New Delhi.",
  "Phizo, on the other hand, had pledged himself to a \u2018war that would not",
  "admitoftruces,retreatsorcompromises\u2019.Thesuggestionthathenegotiateof-",
  "fended him greatly; not least because Sakhrie was, like him, an Angami from",
  "Khonomah, indeed from the same khel or clan of Merhuma. \u2018Phizo was ab-",
  "solutely furious with Sakhrie\u2019s softening posture\u2019, which came when many",
  "young men were flocking to the rebel cause, with the guerrilla army at an all-",
  "timehighof15,000members.ButSakhriewasconvincedthattheystillstood",
  "no chance against the mighty Indian nation. He began touring the villages,",
  "preaching against Phizo\u2019s extremism and warning that violence would only",
  "beget more violence.29",
  "In January 1956 T. Sakhrie was dragged out of bed, taken to the jungle,",
  "tortured,thenkilled.ItwaswidelybelievedthatPhizohadorderedthemurder,although he denied it. In any event, the message had gone home \u2013 this is how",
  "betrayers to the cause would be treated. In March afresh announcement of a",
  "federal government of Nagaland was made. A national flag was designed and",
  "commanders appointed for the different regions of the designated homeland.",
  "Then, in July, occurred a killing that hurt India\u2019s image as much as Sakhrie\u2019s",
  "murder had hurt the NNC. A group of soldiers, having just beaten off a rebel",
  "ambush, were returning to Kohima. The town was under curfew; no one was",
  "supposedtobeoutonthestreets.Catchingsightofasolitaryoldman,thesol-",
  "diers ordered him off the road. When the man protested the jawans beat him",
  "with rifle-butts and finally pushed him off a cliff.",
  "The walker that the soldiers had so callously killed was a doctor named",
  "T. Haralu. He was, in fact, the first allopathic practitioner in the Naga hills",
  "and,assuch,knownandreveredinandaroundKohima.Hiskillingdissipated",
  "any propaganda advantage the Indians might have received from Sakhrie\u2019s",
  "murder. For if that death had \u2018intensified defections from [the NNC] to New",
  "Delhi, exactly the reverse happened by the killing of Dr Haralu\u2019.30",
  "Meanwhile, the army presence had increased considerably. The newly",
  "named Naga Hills Force consisted of one regiment of mountain artillery, sev-",
  "enteen battalions of infantry and fifty platoons of Assam Rifles. The rebels",
  "also had their own military structure \u2013 headed by a commander-in-chief (a",
  "brilliantstrategistnamedKaito)withfourcommandersunderhim,theirtroops",
  "grouped into battalions and companies. The Nagas were equipped with Brit-",
  "ish and Japanese rifles, and with Sten guns and machine guns, all part of",
  "the massive debris left behind after the Second World War. The rebels also",
  "used locally made muzzle-loaders and, in hand-to-hand combat, the tradition-",
  "al Naga sword or dao.",
  "To add to the regular Naga forces there were highly effective bands of",
  "irregulars,dividedinto\u2018volunteerparties\u2019,\u2018courierparties\u2019and\u2018women\u2019svo-",
  "lunteer organizations\u2019. The last-named were nurses who could, when called",
  "upon, fight very well indeed. And there was also the silent support of the",
  "ordinary villager. As part of their counter-insurgency operations, the Indian",
  "army brought isolated hamlets together in \u2018grouped villages\u2019; the residents",
  "hadtosleephereatnight,goingoutinthemorningtoworkinthefields.Inten-",
  "ded to break the chain of information from peasant to rebel, this tactic merely",
  "increased the army\u2019s unpopularity among the Nagas.31",
  "By the middle of 1956 a full-scale war was on in the Naga hills. In a",
  "statement to Parliament in the last week of July, the home minister, Govind",
  "BallabhPant,admittedthattheIndianarmyhadlost68menwhilekilling370",
  "\u2018hostiles\u2019. Pant accused Phizo of murdering Sakhrie \u2013 whom he called the\u2018leader of the sensible and patriotic group\u2019 \u2013 and of \u2018leading them [the Na-",

  "they will realize that we all belong to India\u2019.32",
  "TheIndian(andinternational)presswasnotcoveringtheconflict,butwe",
  "can get a sense of its scale from letters written by a Naga doctor to the last",
  "British deputy commissioner of the Naga hills, Charles Pawsey. A letter of",
  "June1956describesatourintheinteriorwhere\u2018everynightwelookedupand",
  "saw villages burning in the hills \u2013 set alight by either the rebels or the army,",
  "no one knows.\u2019 As for the rebel leader,",
  "Phizo is being absolutely horrible to any Naga Government servant he",
  "catches, and even more so to any Naga who was on his council and",
  "has left him, as many have, because of his extreme methods . . . Many",
  "dobashis [headmen] have vanished and no one knows whether they are",
  "in hiding or Phizo\u2019s got them. Of course, their position is very difficult,",
  "for if they go about Government business Phizo gets them, and if they",
  "don t, the Government gets them.",
  "Two months later, the Naga doctor wrote to Pawsey that",
  "As I see it, .5 per cent of the Nagas are with Phizo; 1 per cent are more",
  "moderate, and want to break away from Assam and come under Delhi,",
  "and 98.5 per cent just want to be left alone\u2019 . . . Of course the way the",
  "army has behaved and is behaving means that now voluntary co-opera-",
  "tion between the Nagas and any Government is beyond hope.",
  "The methods of the army, he added, were such that they \u2018will affect Naga/In-",
  "dian relations for the next 50\u2013100 years\u2019.33",
  "In August 1956 there was an extended debate in the Lok Sabha on the",
  "situation in the Naga hills. A Meitei member from Manipur recounted how,",
  "onarecentvisittotheregion,theconvoyofvehicles hewastravelling inwas",
  "attacked by the rebels. Based on his enquiries, it appeared that \u2018it is very dif-",
  "ficulttobringthemroundtoourwayofthinkingandwaysoflife;moreespe-",
  "cially, Phizo is a hard nut to crack\u2019. He agreed that the Nagas could not \u2018have",
  "separate independence\u2019, yet thought that they should immediately be granted",
  "a separate state within the Indian Union.The next speaker was the Socialist MP Rishang Keishing, who mounted",
  "a fierce attack on the army for burning villages and killing innocent people",
  "(KeishingwashimselfaThangkulNagafromManipur).\u2018Thearmymenhave",
  "shown an utter disregard for the sentiments of the local Nagas, for, they have",
  "triedtoterrifythembycarryingthenakedcorpsesoftheNagaskilledbythem.",
  "When Phizo had met Nehru in 1951 and 1952, said Keishing, \u2018the parties did",
  "not try to understand each other\u2019s mind and the atmosphere was soon viti-",
  "ated and tempers lost\u2019. He wished \u2018that the prime minister had displayed here",
  "the same amount of patience and psychological insight for which he is fam-",
  "ous in the field of international diplomacy\u2019. In the years since, brutal meth-",
  "ods had been used by both sides. \u2018Who can boast of an untarnished record?\u2019",
  "askedKeishing.\u2018Whocandareflingthefirststoneandassertthattheyarenot",
  "sinners? I ask this of the hostile Nagas as well as of the government.\u2019 He re-",
  "commended\u2018animmediatedeclarationofgeneralamnesty\u2019,thesendingofan",
  "all-party delegation of parliamentarians to the disturbed region and a meeting",
  "between the government and the Naga National Council. He also appealed to",
  "Phizo\u2019smentoagree toatruce, \u2018because thecontinuation ofhostilities means",
  "the ruins of innocent citizens\u2019.",
  "The prime minister, in reply, admitted that there had been some killings",
  "\u2013 including that of Dr Haralu, \u2018which has distressed us exceedingly\u2019 \u2013 but",
  "claimed \u2018that by far the greater part of the burning is done by the Naga hos-",
  "tiles\u2019. He argued that the government was seeking the co-operation ofthe Na-",
  "gasandthat,ashehadseveraltimestoldPhizo,NewDelhiwasalwayswilling",
  "to consider suggestions to improve the working of the Sixth Schedule, which",
  "allowed tribal areas great autonomy in the management of their land and re-",
  "sources. He did not, however, think the time ripe for sending a delegation of",
  "parliamentarians to the Naga hills. And he insisted that \u2018it is no good talking",
  "to me about independence [for the Nagas] . . . I consider it fantastic for that",
  "little cornerbetween ChinaandBurmaandIndia\u2013apartofitisinBurma\u2013to",
  "be called an independent state\u2019.34",
  "In December 1956 a publication issued by the Indian High Commission",
  "in London reported the \u2018success\u2019 of army operations in the Naga hills. It",
  "claimed that the military had broken the back of the rebel resistance and was",
  "now \u2018engaged in mopping-up operations\u2019. The news appears to have been",
  "swallowed whole, for weeks later the Manchester Guardian ran an item with",
  "theheadline:\u2018NagaRebellionVirtuallyOver\u2019.TheIndiangovernment,itsaid,",
  "was taking steps \u2018to arrive at some understanding with the Naga moderates,",
  "whose ranks are swelling steadily\u2019. There was, however, no evidence of any",
  "independent confirmation of this new dawn said to be emerging.35V",
  "Through the 1950s the Jharkhand movement carried on its campaign for a",
  "provincewithinIndiarunforandbyadivasis.WhentheStatesReorganization",
  "Commission visited the area in January 1955, they were met everywhere by",
  "processionists shouting \u2018Jharkhand alag prant!\u2019 (Jharkhand must be a separ-",
  "ate state). As one participant in the protests recalled, the \u2018Jharkhand demand",
  "was writ large on every Adivasi face\u2019.36",
  "Across the country, in Manipur, a struggle was afoot to have that former",
  "chiefdom declared a full-fledged state of the Indian Union. Back in 1949 a",
  "popular movement had forced the Maharaja to convene an assembly elected",
  "onthebasisofuniversaladultfranchise.Buttheassemblywasdissolvedwhen",
  "ManipurmergedwithIndia.Theterritorywasnowdesignateda\u2018PartC\u2019state,",
  "which meant that it had no popularly elected body and was ruled by a chief",
  "commissioner responsible directly to Delhi.",
  "Manipur covered an area of 8,600 square miles. There was a mere 700",
  "square miles of valley, inhabited by 380,000 Meiteis owing allegiance to",
  "the Vaishnava traditions of Hinduism. The larger, hilly section was home to",
  "180,000 Naga and Kuki tribals. It was one such tribal, the aforementioned",
  "Rishang Keishing, whoin1954beganamovement forrepresentative govern-",
  "ment in Manipur. Keishing and his fellow socialists daily picketed the office",
  "of the chief commissioner in Imphal. Thousands of satyagrahis courted ar-",
  "rest, many of them women. But the government would not yield. Speaking in",
  "Parliament, the home minister said that the time was not ripe for the creation",
  "of legislative assemblies in Part C states such as Manipur and Tripura. \u2018These",
  "states\u2019, he said, \u2018are strategically situated on the borders of India. The people",
  "are still comparatively politically backward and the administrative machinery",
  "in these States is still weak.\u201937",
  "One does not know whether the Naga National Council took cognizance",
  "of the struggles for Jharkhand and Manipur, and of New Delhi\u2019s reluctance",
  "to give in to them. In any case, Phizo and his men were holding out for",
  "something much more ambitious \u2013 not just a province within India, but a na-",
  "tion outside it. The demand might have been \u2018absurd\u2019, yet it inspired numer-",
  "ous Nagas to abandon their villages and join the guerrillas.",
  "Atthistime,themid-1950s,therewereroughly200,000Nagasinthedis-",
  "trict that bore their name. There were alike number in the adjoining districts",
  "of NEFA, with another 80,000 in Manipur. Half a million Nagas in all, with",
  "perhaps just 10,000 of them participating full time in the struggle. However,weakness in numbers was amply compensated by strength of will. A small",
  "community of rebels had forced the Indian state to send in large contingents",
  "of military to suppress it.",
  "FewIndiansoutsidethenorth-eastknewoftheNagaconflictatthetime,",
  "and virtually no foreigners. Yet the conflict had serious implications for the",
  "unity of the nation, for the survival of its democracy and for the legitimacy of",
  "itsgovernment.Fornowhereelseinthecountry,noteveninKashmir,hadthe",
  "army been sent in to quell a rebellion launched by those who were formally",
  "citizens of the Indian state.",
  "In its first decade, this state had faced problems aplenty \u2013 among them",
  "oppositional movements based on class, religion, language and region. These",
  "had been handled by reason and dialogue or, in very rare instances, by the",
  "use of regular police. The conflict in the Naga hills, on the other hand, would",
  "not admit of such resolution. There was a fundamental incommensurability",
  "betweenwhattheNNCwasdemandingandwhatthegovernmentofIndiawas",
  "willing to give them. This was an argument which, it seemed, could be ended",
  "only by one party prevailing, militarily, over the other.",
  "Jawaharlal Nehru keenly understood the uniqueness of the Naga situ-",
  "ation.WritingtohisCabinetcolleaguesinMarch1955,healertedthemto\u2018the",
  "rather difficult problem in our tribal areas of the North East . . . [where] we",
  "have not succeeded in winning the people of these areas. In fact, they have",
  "been drifting away. In the Naga Hills district, they have non-cooperated for",
  "thelastthreeandahalfyearsanddonesowithgreatdisciplineandsuccess.38",
  "A year later, Nehru wrote to the chief minister of Assam that while the",
  "army would be deployed so long as the rebels had arms and were willing to",
  "use them, \u2018there is something much more to it than merely the military ap-",
  "proach\u2019. While \u2018there can be no doubt that an armed revolt has to be met by",
  "force\u2019, said Nehru, \u2018our whole past and present outlook is based on force by",
  "itself being no remedy. We have repeated this in regard to the greater prob-",
  "lems of the world. Much more must we remember this when dealing with our",
  "own countrymen who have to be won over and not merely suppressed.\u201939",
  "Hiddenawayfromtheeyesoftheworld,unknowneventomostIndians,",
  "theNagarebellionwaswithalaseriousheadacheforthegovernmentofIndia.",
  "Otherwise, Nehru\u2019s regime seemed secure and stable. It had been democrat-",
  "ically elected, with a comfortable majority, while behind its foreign and do-",
  "mestic policies rested a wide national consensus. Soon, however, other chal-",
  "lenges were to arise, these not in the peripheries, but in regions considered to",
