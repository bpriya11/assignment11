  "this was overwhelmingly a country of cultivators and labourers. Nearly three-",
  "quarters of the workforce was in agriculture, a sector which also contributed",
  "close to 60 per cent of India\u2019s gross domestic product. There was a small but",
  "growing industrial sector, which accounted for about 12 per cent of the work-",
  "force, and 25 per cent of GDP.",
  "Thepeasant wasthebackbone oftheIndiannation, andoftheIndianeco-",
  "nomy. There existed enormous variations in agricultural practices across the",
  "subcontinent. There was, for instance, a broad division between the wheat re-",
  "gions of the north and west, where women generally did not participate in cul-",
  "tivation, and the rice regions of the south and east, where women\u2019s work was",
  "critical to the raising of seedlings. Large parts of peninsular India grew neither",
  "ricenorwheat:here,thechiefcerealswereanarrayofdrought-resistantmillets.Besides grain, peasants grew a wide range of fruit crops, as well as market-",
  "oriented produce such as cotton and sugar cane.",
  "These variations notwithstanding, everywhere in India agriculture was",
  "largely empirical, based on knowledge and traditions passed down over the",
  "generations,ratherthanonideasfrombooks.Everywhereitwaschieflybased",
  "on local inputs. The water, the fuel, the fodder, the fertilizer; these were all",
  "gatheredinthevicinityofthevillage.Thelandwastilledwithaploughpulled",
  "by a pair of bullocks. The homes were built of wood and thatch fetched by",
  "hand from the nearby forests.",
  "Everywhere, those who worked on the land lived cheek-by-jowl with",
  "those who didn\u2019t. The agriculturists who made up perhaps two-thirds of the",
  "rural population depended crucially on the service and artisanal castes: on",
  "blacksmiths, barbers, scavengers and the like. In many parts there were vi-",
  "brant communities of weavers. In some parts there were large populations of",
  "nomadic pastoralists.",
  "On the social side, too, there were similarities in the way in which life",
  "was lived across the subcontinent. Levels of literacy were very low. Caste",
  "feelings were very strong, with villages divided into half a dozen or more en-",
  "dogamous jatis. And religious sentiments ran deep.",
  "Rural India was pervaded by an air of timelessness. Peasants, shepherds,",
  "carpenters, weavers, all lived and worked as their forefathers had done. As a",
  "survey of the 1940s putit, \u2018there is the same plainness of life, the same wrest-",
  "ling with uncertainties of climate (except in favoured areas), the same love",
  "of simple games, sport and songs, the same neighbourly helpfulness, and the",
  "same financial indebtedness\u2019.1",
  "To the Indian nationalist, however, continuity was merely a euphemism",
  "for stagnation. Agricultural productivity was low; hence also levels of nutri-",
  "tion and health. About the only thing that was rising was population growth.",
  "Fromthelatenineteenthcentury,asmedicalservicesexpanded,thedeathrate",
  "rapidly fell. Consequently, since the birth rate remained constant, there was a",
  "steady rise in population. Between 1881 and 1941 the population of British",
  "India rose from 257 to 389 million. But (or hence) the per capita availability",
  "of food grains declined from an already low level of200 kilograms per person",
  "per year to a mere 150.",
  "Almost from the time the Congress was founded in 1885, Indian nation-",

  "revenue. The second was the massive expansion of irrigation, both to aug-ment productivity and reduce dependence on the monsoon. The third was the",
  "reform of the system of land tenure. Particularly in north and east India, the",
  "British had encouraged a system of absentee landlordism. In many other dis-",
  "tricts too, those who tilled the land usually did not own it.",
  "While tenants did not have security of tenure, agricultural labourers had",
  "no land to till in the first place. Inequalities in the agrarian economy could",
  "be very sharp indeed. The forms of exploitation were manifold and highly",
  "innovative. Thus, apart from land tax, zamindars (landowners) in the United",
  "Provinces levied an array of additional cesses on their peasants such as mo-",
  "torana (to pay for the zamindar\u2019s new car) and hathiana (to pay for his ele-",
  "phants).2 The landlord was prone to treat his animals and his vehicles far bet-",
  "ter than he did his labourers. Two weeks before Independence a progressive",
  "weekly from Madras ran a story about distress in rural Malabar. This pro-",
  "filed a large landlord who owned seven elephants, for which he needed some",
  "25,000 kilograms of paddy. His own tenants, meanwhile, were given three",
  "days\u2019 ration for the whole week.3",

  "In 1938 the Congress setup a National Planning Committee (NPC), charged",
  "with prescribing a policy for economic development in a soon- to-be-free In-",
  "dia. Chaired by Jawaharlal Nehru, the committee had some thirty members",
  "in all \u2013 these divided almost equally between the worlds of science, industry",
  "and politics. Sub-committees were allotted specific subjects: such as agricul-",
  "ture,industry,powerandfuel,finance,socialservicesandeven\u2018women\u2019srole",
  "in planned economy\u2019. The NPC outlined \u2018national self-sufficiency\u2019 and the",
  "doubling of living standards in ten years as the main goals. Planning itself",
  "was defined as \u2018the technical co-ordination, by disinterested experts, of con-sumption, production, investment, trade, and income distribution, in accord-",
  "ance with social objectives set by bodies representative of the nation\u2019.9",
  "From Japan and Russia the NPC took the lesson that countries that in-",
  "dustrialized late had to depend crucially on state intervention. This applied",

  "Notably, the private sector concurred. In 1944 a group of leading indus-",
  "trialists issued what they called A Plan of Economic Development for India",
  "(more commonly known as the Bombay Plan). This conceded that \u2018the ex-",
  "isting economic organization, based on private enterprise and ownership, has",
  "failed to bring about a satisfactory distribution of the national income\u2019. Only",
  "the state could help \u2018diminish inequalities of income\u2019. But the state was ne-",
  "cessary for augmenting production too. Energy, infrastructure and transport",
  "were sectors where the Indian capitalists themselves felt the need for a gov-",

  "the positive as well as preventative functions of the State is essential to any",

  "Now largely forgotten, the Bombay Plan gives the lie to the claim that",
  "Jawaharlal Nehru imposed a model of centralized economic development on",
  "an unwilling capitalist class. One wonders what free-market pundits would",
  "make of it now. They would probably see it as a dirigiste tract, unworthy of",
  "capitalismandcapitalists.Intruth,itshouldbeseensimplyassymptomaticof",

  "as well as experienced members of the Indian Civil Service.In the summer of 1951 the Planning Commission issued a draft of the",
  "first five-year plan. This focused on agriculture, the sector hardest hit by Par-",
  "tition. Besides increasing food production, the other major emphases of the",
  "plan were on the development of transport and communications, and the pro-",
  "vision of social services. Introducing the proposals in Parliament, Jawaharla",

  "While introducing the first plan, Nehru had said that \u2018it was obvious to",
  "methatwehavetoindustrialiseIndia,andasrapidlyaspossible\u2019.Thatobject-",
  "ive was given pride of place in the second five-year plan. Its drafting was the",
  "handiwork of Prasanta Chandra Mahalanobis, a Cambridge-trained physicist",
  "andstatisticianwhowassteepedinSanskritphilosophyandBengaliliterature",
  "\u2013 in sum, \u2018an awesome polyglot, the kind of man for whom Nehru was guar-",
  "anteed to fall\u2019.16",
  "Mahalanobis was, among other things, the man who brought modern",
  "statistics to India. In 1931 he setup the Indian Statistical Institute (ISI) in Cal-",
  "cutta. Within a decade, he had made the ISI a world-class centre of training",
  "and research. He was also a pioneer of inter-disciplinary research, innovat-",
  "ively applying his statistical techniques in the fields of anthropology, agro-",
  "nomy and meteorology.",
  "In February 1949, Mahalanobis was appointed honorary statistical ad-",
  "viser to the Union Cabinet. The next year he helped establish the National",
  "Sample Survey (NSS) and the year following, the Central Statistical Organ-",
  "ization (CSO). These were setup to collect reliable data on changing living",
  "standards in India \u2013 on wages, employment, consumption and the like. The",
  "NSS and the CSO are two reasons why India has a set of official statistics",
  "more reliable than those found anywhere else in the non-Western world.17",
  "Such are the uncontentious aspects of Mahalanobis\u2019s legacy. Perhaps",
  "more important, and certainly more controversial, are his contributions to the",
  "theory and practice of planning. In 1954 Nehru committed his party, and byextension his country, to the creation of a \u2018socialistic pattern of society\u2019. The",
  "same year, the ISI was asked by the government to study the problem of un-",
  "employment. Mahalanobis wrote a note on the subject, which seems to have",
  "impressed Nehru enough for him to assign the ISI responsibility for drafting",
  "the second five-year plan itself.",
  "Mahalanobis took the task very seriously indeed. In the late summer of",
  "1954,hesetoffforalongtourofEuropeandNorthAmerica.Hehad,hecon-",

  "thuseducational \u2013toimprove hisownknowledge aboutthesubject \u2013butalso",
  "frankly propagandist. By cultivating foreign economists, he hoped to bring",
  "their Indian counterparts around to his own point of view. As he told a friend,",
  "\u2018at the back of everything is one single aim in my own mind \u2013 what effective",
  "help can we secure in making our own plans and in implementing them\u2019.18",
  "Mahalanobis first went to the United States of America, where he col-",
  "lected information on input\u2013output coefficients, these maintained in a deck",
  "of 40,000 Hollerith punched cards. He talked to the man who had done the",
  "work (Wassily Leontief, a future Nobellaureate), before crossing the Atlantic",
  "to meet the dons of Cambridge. The \u2018most brilliant\u2019 of these was Joan Robin-",
  "son, then just back from a trip to China (where she was \u2018much impressed",
  "by the progress they are making\u2019.) She thought that the export\u2013import sector",
  "in India needed more government control. Mahalanobis agreed, and in turn",
  "asked Joan Robinson to visit India as a guest of the ISI. This, he told her,",
  "\u2018might be of very great help to us because her support may carry conviction",
  "thatourapproachtoDevelopmentplanningisnotfoolish.Shesmiledandsaid",
  "\u2013\u201cYes, Ithink Iwould be able to knock some sense into the heads ofthe eco-",
  "nomists in your country.\u201d\u2019",
  "Mahalanobis now crossed the Channel, to converse with the French",
  "Marxists. Then it was time to shift to the other side of the Iron Curtain. He",
  "reached Moscow via Prague, and was at once impressed by the \u2018amazing\u2019",
  "pace of construction work: buildings far bigger, and built much faster, than",
  "any he had ever seen. He had long talks with Soviet academicians, who said",
  "that if India wanted \u2018to do any serious planning we must have the active help",
  "of, not scores, but hundreds of technologists and scientists and engineers\u2019.",
  "Mahalanobis agreed,andinvitedthemtovisithiscountry,sourgentlyinneed",
  "of \u2018specialists and experts in the economics of planning\u2019.19",
  "These travels and talks finally bore fruit in a long paper presented to the",
  "Planning Commission in March 1954. Here Mahalanobis outlined eight ob-",
  "jectives for the second five-year plan. The first of these was \u2018to attain a rapid",
  "growthofthenationaleconomybyincreasingthescopeandimportanceofthepublic sector and in this way to advance to a socialistic pattern of society\u2019;",
  "thesecond,\u2018todevelopbasicheavyindustriesforthemanufactureofproducer",
  "goodstostrengthenthefoundationofeconomicindependence\u2019.Other(andwe",
  "may presume lesser) objectives included the production of consumer goods",
  "by both the factory and household sector, the increasing of agricultural pro-",
  "ductivity and the provision of better housing, health and education facilities.",
  "The emphasis on capital goods was justified in two principal ways. The",
  "first was that it would safeguard this former colony\u2019s economic, and hence",
  "political, independence. The second was that it would help solve the press-",
  "ing problem of unemployment. \u2018Unemployment is chronic because of [the",
  "unavailability of] capital goods\u2019, argued Mahalanobis; it occurs \u2018only when",
  "means of production become idle\u2019. The quickest way to create jobs was to",
  "build dams and factories.20",
  "Mahalanobis\u2019s draft plan was submitted to a panel of expert economists.",
  "With one exception, all endorsed the emphasis on capital goods and the role",
  "of the public sector. To be sure, there were a number of specific caveats.",
  "Some economists urged a greater complementarity of agricultural and indus-",
  "trial production; others worried about where the funds for the plan would",
  "come from. Increasing taxes would not by themselves suffice, while deficit",
  "financing might lead to high inflation.",

  "But, on the whole, the leading economists of India were behind what was",
  "already being called \u2018the Mahalanobis Model of Planning\u2019.21",
  "This model was, among other things, an evocation of the old nationalist",
  "model of swadeshi, or self-reliance. Once, Gandhian protesters had burnt for-",
  "eign cloth to encourage the growth of indigenous textiles; now, Nehruvian",
  "technocrats would make their own steel and machine tools rather than buy",
  "themfromoutside.Asthesecondplanargued,underdevelopmentwas\u2018essen-",
  "tially a consequence of insufficient technological progress\u2019.22 Self-reliance,",
  "from this perspective, became the index of development and progress. From",
  "soap to steel, cashew to cars, Indians would meet their material requirements",
  "by using Indian land, Indian labour, Indian materials and, above all, Indian",
  "technology.",
  "Table 10.1 compares the sectoral outlays for the first and second plans.",
  "Inproportionaltermsthesectorsofpower,transportandcommunications,and",
  "social services, retained broadly the same importance. The decisive shift was",
  "from agriculture to industry, this compounded by a decline in the importance",
  "of irrigation.",
  "While the heavy industries would be owned by the state, there was still",
  "plenty of room for private enterprise. For in \u2018an expanding economy the",
  "private sector would have an assured market\u2019. Their main contribution would",
  "come in the form of consumer goods, these to be produced by units large as",
  "well as small.23",
  "Agovernmentresolutionof1956classifiednewindustriesintothreecat-",

  "cluded atomic energy, defence-related industries, aircraft, iron and steel, elec-",

  "other key minerals. Class II would witness both public and private sector par-",

  "pulp and paper, and road transport. Class III consisted of all the remaining in-",
  "dustries, to be undertaken \u2018ordinarily through the initiative and enterprise of",
  "the private sector\u2019.24Would the Mahalanobis model succeed? Many Indians thought so, most",
  "Indians certainly hoped so. So did their sympathizers worldwide. Represent-",
  "ative here are the views of J. B. S. Haldane, the great British biologist who",
  "wasthenplanningtomovetoIndiaandtheISI.Whenshownthedraftplanby",
  "Mahalanobis, Haldane commented that",
  "Even if one is pessimistic, and allows a 15 per cent chance of failure",
  "through interference by the United States (via Pakistan or otherwise), a",
  "10 per cent chance of interference by the Soviet Union and China, a 20",

  "tionalism, that leaves a 50 per cent chance for a success which will alter",
  "the whole history of the world for the better.25",
  "III",
  "If Mahalanobis was the chief technician of Indian planning, then Nehru was",
  "its chief missionary. The prime minister believed that, in the Indian context,",
  "planningwasmuchmorethanrationaleconomics.Itwasgoodpoliticsaswell.",
  "While the plan was based on the work of economists and statisticians, to real-",
  "ize its goal the \u2018people must have the sensation of partnership in a mighty",
  "enterprise, of being fellow-travellers towards the next goal that they and we",
  "havesetbeforeus\u2019.Popularparticipationwastheonlywaytomake\u2018thisPlan,",
  "which is enshrined in cold print, something living, vital and dynamic, which",
  "captures the imagination of our people\u2019.26",
  "Planning was thus a \u2018mighty co-operative effort of all the people of In-",
  "dia\u2019. Nehru hoped that the new projects would be a solvent to dissolve the",
  "schisms of caste and religion, community and region. Introducing the first",
  "plan to his chief ministers, he wrote that \u2018the more we think of this balanced",
  "picture ofthewhole ofIndiaandofits many-sided activities, which aresoin-",
  "terrelated with one another, the less we are likely to go astray in the crooked",
  "paths of provincialism, communalism, casteism and all other disruptive and",
  "disintegrating tendencies\u2019. Introducing the second plan, he called it a \u2018brave",
  "effort to fashion our future\u2019, that will \u2018require all the strength and energy that",
  "we possess\u2019. He believed that \u2018ultimately this is the only way to deal with the",
  "separatism, provincialism and sectarianism that we have to combat\u2019.27On the economic side, Nehru singled out two activities as providing the",
  "\u2018essential bases\u2019 for planning: the production of power and the production",
  "of steel.28 At Independence, India had only two steel plants, both privately",
  "owned, which produced just over a million tones a year. This was inadequate",
  "foranexpandingeconomy,moresoonethathadcommitteditselftothebuild-",
  "ing of heavy industries.",
  "The private sector was barred from starting new enterprises in steel,",
  "which, along with coal, shipbuilding, atomic energy and aircraft production,",
  "was deemed too important to be subject to the profit motive. The forest belt",
  "that runs across central India was rich in iron ore and coal, and it had plenty",
  "of rivers too. At once a lively competition began between the states that com-",
  "prised this belt, each seeking to have the first public-sector steel plant with",
  "in its borders. This was paralleled by a competition between the industrial-",
  "izedcountriesoftheWest,eachofwhomwantedthecontracttobuildthefirst",
  "plant.29",
  "The second plan had set a target of 6 million tonnes of steel. The output",
  "wasneededtoprovideinputstootherplannedindustries.Butitwasalsoaway",

  "In the economic modernization of India, large dams occupied a rather special",
  "place. They would, on the one hand, emancipate agriculture from the tyranny",
  "of the monsoon and, on the other, provide the electric power to run the new",
  "industries mandated by the five-year plans. Jawaharlal Nehru was enchanted",

  "sharedbymillionsofhiscountry-men,whotoocametoveneratethesetower-",
  "ing new monuments built in mud and concrete.",
  "Indian intellectuals greatly admired the Tennessee Valley Authority, the",
  "integrated project that was a cornerstone of Franklin Roosevelt\u2019s New Deal.",
  "But they also admired the massive multipurpose projects undertaken in the",
  "Soviet Union. In the 1940s, anticipating Independence, scientists and engin-",
  "eers made trips to America and Russia to acquaint themselves at first hand",
  "withhowdamswerebuilt.Theyweredeeplyimpressedwithwhattheysaw.34",
  "On either side of the Iron Curtain, these projects represented \u2018the triumph",
  "of science, technology, foresight and centralized government over politics,",
  "petty local authorities and powers, ignorance, superstition, and backward-",
  "ness\u2019. They represented, indeed, \u2018the salvation of the nation through rational-",
  "ity and strength\u2019.35Like North America and Russia, the subcontinent had numerous large",
  "rivers.Dammingandtamingtheseriverswouldkillthreebirdswithonestone;",
  "generating electricity, providing water for irrigation and preventing flooding.",
  "Afteraparticularly lethal boutoffloodingontheGodavari inthemonsoonof",
  "1953, a leading engineer wrote to a leading politician that this was a river",
  "with enormous potential for good. The destruction caused by floods of",
  "this year has, however, demonstrated that if these flood waters are not",
  "harnessed for beneficial use, they will constitute a potential threat to the",
  "well-beingofthepeople.Properlyconserved,thesefloodwaterswillsat-",
  "isfy all the needs of the Godavari basin and leave ample reserves, which",
  "integratedwiththeKrishnawaterswillenableirrigationandpowerbene-",
  "fits to be extended right down to Madras and further south . . . No effort",
  "should therefore be spared in harnessing of the Godavari waters, in op-",
  "timum integration with the Krishna, nor extraneous reasons permitted to",
  "delay or jeopardise their consummation.36",
  "Here was a proselytizing technocrat speaking to the already converted. For",
  "while the Godavari was still undammed, most of the other major rivers had",
  "already come under the hand of man. Among the massive dam projects under",
  "way were those on the Mahanadi, Rihand, Tungabhadra, Damodar and Sutlej",
  "rivers.",
  "In the mid-1950s the political scientist Henry Hart wrote a lyrical ac-",
  "count of the transformation of \u2018New India\u2019s Rivers\u2019. For Hart, these projects",
  "were \u2018the greatest of the monuments of free India\u2019; to them \u2018men and women",
  "come, in a pilgrimage growing season by season, to see for themselves the",
  "dams and canals and power stations\u2019.",
  "In the book, there is a particularly fine description of the construction of",
  "the Tungabhadra dam. When finished, the dam would embody 32 million cu-",
  "bicfeetofmasonry;theselaidattherateof40,000cubicfeetaday,everyday",
  "for five years. The sheer scale could properly be conveyed only by means of",
  "analogy. \u2018Imagine the masonry in Tungabhadra Dam\u2019, wrote Hart, \u2018being laid",
  "as a highway, 20 feet wide, 6 inches thick. It would extend from Luck now to",
  "Calcutta, or from Bombay to Madras.\u201937",
  "Without question the most prestigious of all these schemes was the",
  "Bhakra\u2013Nangal project in northern India. Again, its scale is best narrated in",
  "numbers. At 680 feet, the Bhakra dam was the second highest in the world;",
  "only the Grand Coulee Dam, on the Colorado river, was higher. The concreteand masonry that would finally go into it was estimated at 500 million cu-",
  "bic feet, \u2018more than twice the cubic contents of the seven great pyramids of",
  "Egypt\u2019. The project would generate nearly a million kilowatts of electricity,",
  "while the water from the reservoir would irrigate 7.4 million acres of land,",
  "thiscarried incanals forwhoseexcavation 30million cubic yardsofmudand",
  "stone had to be removed.38",
  "This project was a form of compensation for the refugee farmers from",
  "West Punjab, a substitute for the canal colonies they had left behind on the",
  "other side of the border. These peasants, predominantly Sikh, had \u2018a martyr-",
  "like yearning to recreate within their own lifetimes the prosperity of which",

  "jabis could, if they so chose, for the first time build an industrial future for",
  "themselves.",
  "The Bhakra\u2013Nangal project was described in minute detail in a special",
  "issue of the Indian Journal of Power and River Valley Development. The",
  "issue opened with a set off our most revealing photographs. The first showed",
  "the densely wooded site before work began \u2013 it carried the caption, \u2018River",
  "Sutlej at Bhakra in its primeval splendour \u2013 the site as it was\u2019. The second",
  "showed crane-like structures in the water and a low bridge slung across the",
  "gorge: this was \u2018Exploratory drilling in river bed with drills mounted on pon-",
  "toons \u2013 the first invasion\u2019. The third photo, taken apparently in the dry sea-",
  "son, showed hillsides by now quite bare, with trucks and bulldozers on the",
  "riverbed. Thus \u2018Concreting of the Dam begins \u2013 man lays the foundation for",
  "changing nature\u2019. In the last photo, the dam had begun to rise, aided by ma-",
  "chines of a shape and size never before seen in India. This was \u2018Excavation",
  "with heavy machines in progress in pit-area \u2013 the struggle with nature\u2019.39",
  "The men and women who worked at Bhakra were all Indian, with one",
  "exception. This was an American, Harvey Slocum. Slocum had little formal",
  "education;startingoutasalabourerinasteelmill,hehadrisentotheposition",
  "of construction superintendent on the Grand Coulee dam. Slocum joined the",
  "Bhakra team as chief engineer in 1952 and imprinted upon it his own dis-",
  "tinctive style of working. Officers and workers of all levels were mandated to",
  "dress uniformly. Slocum himself was at the site at 8 a.m. sharp, staying there",
  "until late evening. A stern disciplinarian, he could not abide the sloth and in-",
  "efficiency that was rampant around him. Once, when the telephone system",

  "Indian air force dipped their wings overhead. Next he opened the sluice gates",
  "of the dam. Seeing the water coming towards them, the villagers downstream",

  "miles the boisterous celebration spread like a chain reaction along the great",

  "In the push to industrialize India, a key role had to be played by technology",

  "tablished independently, outside of the existing universities. Within the ambit",
  "of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research were some two dozen",
  "individual institutes. There was a strong utilitarian agenda at work, with sci-",
  "entists in these laboratories encouraged to develop new products for Indians",
  "rather than publish academic papers in foreign journals.43",
  "An Indian scientist whom Nehru patronized early and consistently was",
  "the brilliant Cambridge-educated physicist Homi Bhabha. Bhabha founded",
  "and directed two major scientific institutions. The first was the Tata Institute",
  "of Fundamental Research in Bombay whose work, as its name implies, was",
  "aimedmostlyatbasicresearch.Ithadworld-classdepartments ofphysicsand",
  "mathematics and also, in time, housed India\u2019s first mainframe computer. The",
  "second was the Atomic Energy Commission, mandated to build and run In-",
  "dia\u2019s nuclear power plants. This was handsomely funded by the government",
  "with an annual budget, in 1964, of about Rs100 million.44Many new engineering schools were also started. These included the",
  "flagship Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs), five of which were inaugur-",
  "atedbetween1954and1964.Likethenewlaboratories,thenewcollegeswere",
  "intended to augment indigenous technical capability. Both Nehru and Bhabha",
  "were determined to lessen India\u2019s dependence on the West for scientific ma-",
  "terialsandknow-how.Theybelievedthat\u2018ifanitemofequipmentwasimpor-",
  "ted from abroad, all one got was that particular instrument. But if one built it",
  "oneself, an all-important lesson in expertise was learnt as well\u2019.45",
  "VI",
  "The industrial bias of Indian planning was tempered by a range of pro-",
  "grammes promoting agrarian uplift. On the morning of 2 October 1952 (Ma-",
  "hatma Gandhi\u2019s birthday), the president of India inaugurated a nationwide",
  "series of community development programmes with abroad-cast over the ra-",
  "dio. Fifty-five projects were launched across India that day, these funded",
  "jointlybythegovernmentsofIndiaandtheUnitedStates.Amongtheschemes",
  "to be promoted by community development were roads and wells, cattle wel-",
  "fare and improved methods of cultivation.",
  "The projects were launched by ministers, chief ministers, and commis-",
  "sioners. These dignitaries helped remove earth for building roads and laid",
  "foundation stones for schools and hospitals. In Alipur village, twelve miles",
  "out of Delhi on the road to Karnal, Jawaharlal Nehru dug into the earth to",
  "help prepare a road. \u2018With verve and vigour he plunged into the work, having",
  "taken his jacket off.\u2019 His companion, the American ambassador, also carried",
  "some baskets of earth. Not everyone was as agile as these two. When a well-",
  "dressed official attempted to emulate the prime minister the villagers shouted",
  "\u2018Sarparl!Sarparl\u2019\u2013meaning,\u2018Carrythebasketsonyourhead,youfool,not",
  "with your hands!\u2019 Speaking to the villagers, Nehru said that community de-",
  "velopment would bring about a rural revolution by peaceful means, not, as in",
  "other places, by the breaking of heads.46",
  "Howdidtheseschemesworkinpractice?Twoyearsaftertheybegan,the",
  "anthropologist S. C. Dube studied a community development project in west-",
  "ern Uttar Pradesh. He looked at the project from the viewpoint of the village-",
  "level worker (VLW), the government functionary mandated with taking new",
  "ideas to the peasants.ByDube\u2019saccount,these\u2018agentsofchange\u2019certainlyhadenergyanden-",
  "terprise. They got up at the crack of dawn, and worked all day. Among their",
  "duties were the demonstration to the villagers of the merits of new seeds and",
  "chemical fertilizers. These were tried on sample plots, the peasants looking",
  "onastheVLWexplainedscientificmethodsofdibbling.Differentcropswere",
  "sown, and different combinations of fertilizers used. The VLW also offered",
  "the villagers free angrezi khad (English manure) for use on their fields.",
  "It appears that the peasants of the UP were somewhat ambivalent about",
  "the new techniques. Here is a conversation between the VLW and a farmer",
  "known only by his initials, \u2018MS\u2019:",
  "VLW: What do you think of the new seed?",
  "What can I think? If the government thinks it is good, it must be",
  "MS:",
  "good.",
  "VLW: Do you think it is better than the local variety?",
  "Yes.Itresistsdiseasemuchbetter.Itcanstandfrostandrain,and",
  "MS:",
  "there is more demand for it in the market.",
  "VLW: What about yield?",
  "MS: I cannot say. Some people say it is more, others say it is not.",
  "VLW: Some people say it is not as good in taste.",
  "They are right. It is not half as good. If the roti [bread] is served",
  "hot it is more or less the same, but if we keep it for an hour or so",
  "MS:",
  "it gets as tough as hide. No, it is not as good in taste. People say",
  "that we all get very weak if we eat this wheat.",
  "VLW: What is your experience?",
  "Many more people suffer from digestive disorders these days.",
  "Our children have coughs and colds. Perhaps it is because of the",
  "MS:",
  "newseedandsugarcane.Itmaybethattheairhasbeenspoiltby",
  "the wars.",
  "VLW: And what about the new fertilizer?",
  "Theyincreasetheyield;thereisnodoubtaboutit.Buttheyprob-",
  "MS:",
  "ably destroy the vitality of the land and also of the grain.47",
  "Indian peasants had mixed feelings about the new seeds and fertilizers. But",
  "theyunambiguouslywelcomedfreshsuppliesofwater.AtthesametimeasS.C. Dube was studying community development in the UP, the British anthro-",
  "pologist Scarlett Epstein was living in Wangala, a village in southern Myso-",
  "re lately the beneficiary of canal irrigation. Till the water came, this was like",
  "any other hamlet in the interior Deccan, growing millet for its own consump-",
  "tion. With irrigation came new crops such as paddy and sugar cane. These",
  "were sold outside the village for a handsome return. Paddy gave a profit after",
  "expenses of Rs136 per acre; sugar cane as much as Rs980 per acre. These",
  "changes in local economics fostered changes in lifestyle as well. Before the",
  "canals arrived, the residents of Wangala wore scruffy clothes and rarely ven-",
  "tured outside the village. But \u2018Wangala men now wear shirts and a number",
  "alsoweardhotis;theirwiveswearcolourfulsarisboughtwithmoneyandthey",
  "all spend lavishly on weddings. Wangala men pay frequent visits to Mandya",
  "[town], where they visit coffee shops and toddy shops; rice has replace dragi",
  "as their staple diet.\u2019",
  "Theseandotherchangesweremadepossibleonlybytheextensionofir-",
  "rigation. As Epstein found, the coming of canal water was the turning point",
  "in the history of the village. Events of note, such as weddings, deaths and",
  "murders, were dated by whether they happened before or after irrigation.48",
  "VII",
  "Assuredirrigationandchemical fertilizers increasedagricultural productivity.",
  "But they could not solve what was a fundamental problem of rural India: in-",
  "equality in access to land. Therefore, landless peasants were encouraged to",
  "settleinareasnotpreviouslyundertheplough.InthefirstdecadeofIndepend-",
  "ence, close to half a million hectares of land were colonized, principally from",
  "malarial forests in the northern Terai, the central Indian hills, and the Western",
  "Ghats. Previously these areas had been inhabited only by tribes genetically",
  "resistanttomalaria.WiththeinventionofDDTitbecamepossibleforthestate",
  "to clear the forests. These lands were naturally fertile, rich in calcium and po-",
  "tassium and organic matter (if poor in phosphates). In any case, there was no",
  "shortage of peasants who wanted them.49",
  "Asecondwayoftacklinglandlessnesswastopersuadelargelandholders",
  "to voluntarily give up land under their possession. This was a method pi-",
  "oneered by a leading disciple of Gandhi, Vinoba Bhave. In 1951 Bhave",
  "undertook a walking tour through the then communist-dominated areas of",
  "Telengana. In Pochempelli village, he persuaded a zamindar namedRamchandraRedditodonateahundredacresofland.ThisencouragedBhave",
  "to make this a country wide campaign, known as the \u2018Bhoodan movement.",
  "The saint trudged through the Indian heartland, giving speeches wherever he",
  "went. He must have walked perhaps 50,000 miles, while collecting in excess",
  "of 4 million acres. At first his mission was reckoned a success \u2013 like commu-",
  "nitydevelopment,anobleGandhianalternativetoviolentrevolution.Butlater",
  "assessments were less charitable. Like some other saints, Bhave preferred the",
  "grand gesture over humdrum detail. Critics pointed out that the bulk of the",
  "land donated to Bhave had never been distributed to the landless; over the",
  "yearsithadslowlyreturnedtothehandsoftheoriginalowners.Besides,much",
  "of the land that stayed under Bhoodan was rocky and sandy, unfit for cultiva-",
  "tion. Infew places were the intended beneficiaries organized to workthe land",
  "theyhadbeengifted.Onbalance,theBhoodanmovementmustbereckoneda",
  "failure, albeit a spectacular one.50",
  "A third way of ending landlessness was to use the arm of the state.",
  "Land reform legislation had long been on the agenda of the Congress. After",
  "Independence, the different states passed legislation abolishing the zamindari",
  "system which, under the British, had bestowed effective rights of ownership",
  "to absentee landlords. The abolition of zamindari freed up large areas of land",
  "for redistribution, while also freeing tenants from cesses and rents previously",
  "exacted from them.",

  "After the end of zamindari, the state vested rights of ownership in their",

  "were those at the bottom of the heap, such as low-caste labourers and share-",
  "croppers. Their well-being would have required a second stage of land re-",
  "forms, where ceilings would be placed on holdings, and excess land handed",
  "over to the landless. This was a task that the government was unable or un-",
  "willing to undertake.51",
  "Even after a decade of planning, access to land remained very unequal.",
  "Table 10.2 indicates the percentages in five size classes of both the absolute",
  "number of holdings and the combined operational area of those holdings.",

  "Tobesure,thereweredissenters.IntheWesttherewasFriedrichHayek,",
  "who advocated a retreat of the state from economic activity. His ideas,",
  "however, were treated with benign \u2013 and sometimes not-so-benign \u2013 con-",
  "tempt. (He could not even get a position in the Department of Economics in",
  "the University of Chicago, being placed instead in the \u2018Committee on Social",
  "Thought\u2019.) And in India there was B. R. Shenoy, the sole economist in the",
  "panel of experts who disagreed with the basic approach of the second five-",
  "year plan. As one commentator wrote, Shenoy \u2018appeared to be committed to",
  "laissez-faire methods in so doctrinaire a manner that no one, outside certain",
  "business circles, took much note of his criticisms\u2019.53",
  "In truth, Shenoy\u2019s arguments went beyond a mere belief in laissez faire.",
  "While he opposed the \u2018general extension of nationalisation on principle\u2019, his",
  "main criticism of the plan was that it was overambitious. It had, he thought,",
  "seriously overestimated the rate of savings in the Indian economy. The short-",
  "fall in funds would have to be made up by deficit financing, contributing to",
  "greater inflation.54",
  "Another dissenter was the Chicago economist Milton Friedman. Visiting",
  "India in 1955 at the invitation of the government, he wrote a memorandum",
  "setting out his objections to the Mahalanobis model. He thought it too math-",
  "ematical: obsessed by capital\u2013output ratios, rather than by the developmentof human capital. He deplored the emphasis in industrial policy on the two",
  "extremes \u2013 large factories that used too little labour and cottage industries",
  "that used too much. As he saw it, the \u2018basic requisites\u2019 of economic policy",
  "in a developing country were \u2018a steady and moderately expansionary monet-",
  "ary framework, greatly widened opportunities for education and training, im-",
  "proved facilities for transportation and communication to promote the mobil-",
  "ity not only of goods but even more important of people, and an environment",
  "that gives maximum scope to the initiatives and energy of farmers, business-",

  "Independently of Friedman, a young Indian economist had taken up one",
  "aspect of this critique \u2013 the neglect of education. The constitution mandated",
  "free and compulsory schooling for children up to the age of fourteen. But the",
  "sums allocated for this by the second plan, wrote B. V. Krishnamurti, were",
  "\u2018absurdly low\u2019. He called for a \u2018substantial increase\u2019 in the allotment for edu-",

  "A concerted effort on these lines to educate the mass of the population,",

  "of a cumulatively expansionist character. This would greatly lighten the",
  "task of the Government in bringing about rapid economic development.",
  "For in a reasonable time, one could expect that the ignorance and iner-",
  "tia of the people would crumble and an urge to improve one\u2019s material",
  "conditions by utilising the available opportunities would develop. If this",
  "were to happen, the employment problem would take care of itself. The",

  "Indian economists \u2013 a lone free-marketeer drowned out by a chorus of social",
  "democrats and leftists.57",
  "A critique of a different kind came from the Marxists. They thought that",
  "the Mahalanobis model gave not too little importance to the market, but toomuch.Thesecondplan,theyfelt,shouldhavemandatedathoroughgoingpro-",

  "tion systems were more efficacious than large dams; that organic manure was",
  "a cheap and sustainable method of augmenting soil fertility (when compared",

  "should be managed from the point of view of water conservation rather than",
  "revenue maximization (by protecting natural multispecies forests rather than",
  "themonocultural standsfavouredbythestate). These specific criticisms were",
  "part of a wider understanding of the world of nature. As Mira Behn wrote in",
  "1949:",
  "The tragedy today is that educated and moneyed classes are altogether",

  "were soon finding out, dams were destructive of human community as well.",
  "By the early 1950s reports began appearing of the sufferings of those dis-",
  "placed by dams. In the summer of 1952, when the Hirakud authorities issued",
  "eviction notices to the residents of the 150 villages the project would sub-",

  "\u2018the prosperity of Hirakud will be built on the sacrifice of such people who",

  "The free-market critique; the human capital critique; the ecological critique \u2013",
  "these make for fascinating reading today. But at the time these notes of dis-",

  "whelming consensus in favour of a heavy industry-oriented, state-supported",
  "model of development. This was a consensus among intellectuals; no fewer",
  "than twenty-three of the twenty-four expert economists asked to comment on",
  "the Mahalanobis plan agreed with it in principle.61",
