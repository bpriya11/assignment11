  "the most important was, and is, the state of Jammu and Kashmir. At 84,471",

  "over 4million was more thinly spread. The state was marked by a great deal of",
  "cultural heterogeneity. There were five main regions. The province of Jammu,",
  "abutting Punjab, had low hills and large areas of arable land. Before Partition",
  "the Muslims were in a slight majority (53 per cent), but with the wave of panic",
  "migrations that year Jammu came to be dominated by Hindus. In contrast, the",
  "Valley of Kashmir, which lay to Jammu\u2019s north, had a substantial Muslim ma-",
  "jority. The Valley was, by common consent, one of the most beautiful parts of",
  "India,itslakesandslopesvisitedinthesummerbywealthytouristsfromDelhi",
  "and the Punjab. It was also home to a body of sophisticated craftsmen working",
  "with silk, wool, wood and brass, making exquisite artefacts that were exported",
  "toallpartsofIndiaandbeyond.InbothJammuandtheValleytherewasalsoa",
  "fair sprinkling of Sikhs.",
  "To the Valley\u2019s east lay the high mountains of Ladakh, bordering Tibet,",
  "and peopled mostly by Buddhists. Further west lay the thinly populated tracts",
  "ofGilgitandBaltistan.ThepeoplehereweremostlyMuslim,butfromtheShia",
  "and Ismaili branches of Islam, rather than (as was the case in the Valley) from",
  "the dominant Sunni tradition.These disparate territories were brought under a single state only in the",
  "nineteenth century. The unifiers were a clan of Dogra Rajputs from Jammu",
  "who conquered Ladakh in the 1830s, acquired the vale of Kashmir (hereafter",
  "\u2018the Valley\u2019) from the British in the 1840s and moved into Gilgit by the end",
  "ofthecentury.AndthusthestateofJammuandKashmir(hereafter\u2018Kashmir\u2019",
  "came to share borders with Afghanistan, Chinese Sinkiang and Tibet. Only a",
  "very narrow tract of Afghan territory separated it from the Soviet Union.1",

  "a Hindu ruling a mostly Muslim population was compounded by an accident",
  "ofgeography:unliketheotherdisputedchiefdoms,suchasJunagadhandHy-",
  "derabad, Kashmir was contiguous with both India andPakistan.",
  "The Maharaja of Kashmir in 1947 was Hari Singh. Having ascended the",
  "throne in September 1925, he spent much time at the racecourse in Bombay,",
  "and much time hunting in the vast and plentifully stocked jungles of his do-",

  "what is going on outside.\u20192",
  "For much of his rule, the maharaja\u2019s b\u00eate noire was a Muslim from the",
  "Valley named Sheikh Muhammad Abdullah. Born in 1905,the son ofa shawl",
  "merchant, Abdullah graduated with a master\u2019s degree in science from the Al-",
  "igarh Muslim University. Despite his qualifications he was unable to find a",
  "government job in Kashmir, for the state administration was dominated by",
  "Hindus.Abdullahbegantoquestion\u2018whyMuslimswerebeingsingledoutfor",
  "such treatment. We constituted the majority and contributed the most towards",
  "the State\u2019s revenues, still we were continually oppressed . . . Was it because a",
  "majorityofGovernmentservantswerenon-Muslims?...Iconcludedthatthe",
  "ill-treatment of Muslims was an outcome of religious prejudice.\u20193",
  "Denied a job by the state, Abdullah became a schoolteacher instead. He",
  "started a reading club and spoke out on behalf of his fellow subjects. His was",
  "an inspiring presence: he stood 6\u2019 4\u201d tall and was a witty and compelling",
  "orator. Although he smoked the odd cigarette he did not drink. He visited the",
  "mosque every Friday, and had a deep knowledge of the Quran.4",
  "In the summer of 1931 Abdullah was chosen as part of a delegation of",
  "Muslimsthathopedtoplacetheircasebeforethemaharaja.5Beforetheycould",
  "meet with him, an activist named Abdul Qadir was arrested and put on tri-",
  "al. This led to a clash between protesters and the police in which twenty-onepeople died. This was followed by a wave of communal violence in the Val-",
  "ley, in which many Hindu shops were looted and burnt.",
  "The next year, 1932, an All-Jammu Kashmir Muslim Conference was",
  "formed to give shape to the growing opposition to the maharaja. Among its",
  "leading lights were Sheikh Abdullah and Ghulam Abbas, a lawyer from Jam-",
  "mu. Six years later, Abdullah took the lead in transforming the organization",
  "into a \u2018National Conference\u2019, which would also include Hindus and Sikhs.",
  "The newbody asked for representative government based on universal suf-",
  "frage.",
  "At about this time Abdullah also made the acquaintance of Jawaharlal",
  "Nehru.Theyhititoffinstantly.Bothwereimpulsiveandhadstrongviews,but",
  "fortunately these were the same \u2013 a commitment to Hindu\u2013Muslim harmony",
  "and to socialism. The National Conference grew closer to the Indian National",
  "Congress, alienating some of its members, most notably Ghulam Abbas, who",
  "left the party and sought to organize Kashmiri Muslims on their own. This",
  "was the beginning of a bitter rivalry with Sheikh Abdullah, a feud which was",
  "as much personal as it was ideological.",
  "In the mid-1940s Abdullah was winning this popularity contest hands-",
  "down. He was, recalled one contemporary, \u2018greatly loved by the people of",
  "Kashmir at the time\u2019.6 He had been in and out of jail since 1931, and in",
  "1946 he was incarcerated once more after he asked the Dogra dynasty to",
  "\u2018quit Kashmir\u2019 and hand over power to the people. In the ensuing unrest",

  "Nehru was prevented from entering by the maharaja\u2019s men, who stopped him",
  "at the border and sent him back to British India.7",
  "Now that it was clear that the British would soon leave the subcontinent,",
  "HariSingh\u2019sprimeminister,RamchandraKak,encouragedhimtothinkofin-",
  "dependence for his state. On 15 July 1946 the maharaja stated that the Kash-",
  "miris would \u2018work out our own destiny without dictation from any quarter",
  "which is not an integral part of the State\u20198 In November the British Resident",
  "in Srinagar observed that the",
  "Maharaja and Kak are seriously considering the possibility of Kashmir",
  "notjoiningthe[Indian]Unionifitisformed.OnapreviousoccasionKak",
  "hinted to me that Kashmir might have to stay out of the Union in view",
  "of the antagonism likely to be displayed by a Congress Central Govern-ment towards Kashmir. The Maharaja\u2019s attitude is, I suspect, that once",
  "Paramountcy disappears Kashmir will have to stand on its own feet, that",
  "the question of loyalty to the British Government will not arise and that",

  "the Congress, so he could not think of joining India. But if he joined Pakistan",
  "the fate of his Hindu dynasty might be sealed.10",
  "In April 1947 a new viceroy took over in New Delhi. As it turned out,",
  "he was an old acquaintance of Maharaja Hari Singh; they had served together",
  "on the Prince of Wales\u2019s staff back when the prince visited India in 1921-2.",
  "In the third week of June 1947, after the decision was taken to divide India,",
  "Lord Mountbatten setoff for Kashmir,('largely to forestall Nehru or Gandhi",
  "from doing so').11 He wanted to make his own assessment of where the state",
  "might be going. In Srinagar, the viceroy met Kak and advised him to tell the",
  "maharaja to accede to either dominion \u2013 but to accede. The prime minister",
  "defiantly answered that they intended to stay independent.12 The viceroy then",
  "fixed a private meeting with the maharaja. On the appointed day, the last of",

  "As relations with Pakistan deteriorated, the maharaja sacked two prime",

  "theycrossedtheborderthatseparatedtheNorth-WestFrontierProvincesfrom",
  "Kashmir and briskly made their way towards the capital, Srinagar.",

  "\u2018tribal invasion of Kashmir\u2019.",
  "Thereare,however,plentyofloadedaccounts,biasedinonedirectionor",

  "across the border by Pakistan, who also supplied them with rifles and am-",
  "munition.ThePakistanisdisclaimedanyinvolvementintheinvasion-theyin-",
  "sisted that it was a \u2018spontaneous\u2019 rushing of Pathan Muslims to the aid of co-",
  "religionists persecuted by a Hindu king and a Hindu administration.23",
  "There was, indeed, discontent in one part of Kashmir. This was the dis-",
  "trictofPoonch,whichlaytothewestofSrinagar.Until1936Poonchhadbeen",
  "ruled by a subsidiary clan of the Dogra ruling family, but in that year the dis-",
  "trict came directly under the control of the maharaja in Srinagar. The loss of",
  "autonomy hurt, as did the new taxes imposed by the king. There were cesses",
  "on individual goats, sheep and cattle and a tax on entering the forest. Hardest",
  "hit were the pastoralists of Poonch, almost all of whom were Muslim.24",
  "DuringtheSecondWorldWarmanyMuslimsfromPoonchservedinthe",
  "British Indian Army. They came back, as demobilized soldiers tend to do, ashighly conscious political beings. The rule of the Maharaja of Kashmir had",
  "already been challenged in the Valley by Sheikh Abdullah and his party. To",
  "that was now added the independent challenge of the men of Poonch.",
  "On 14 August several shops and offices in Poonch had flown Pakistani",
  "flags, indicating that their allegiance lay to that country, and not to the still",
  "unaffiliated state of Kashmir. In the following weeks clashes between Dogra",
  "troops and local protesters were reported. By the beginning of September",
  "dozensofPoonchmenhadequippedthemselveswithriflesobtainedfrom\u2018in-",
  "formal sources in Pakistan\u2019. They had also established a base in the Pakistani",
  "town of Murree; here were collected arms and ammunition to be smuggled",
  "across the border to Kashmir. Pakistani accounts acknowledge that both the",
  "prime minister, Liaqat Ali Khan, and a senior Punjab Muslim League leader,",
  "Mian Iftikharuddin, knew and sanctioned assistance to the Poonch rebels.",
  "Overseeing the operation was Abkar Khan, a colonel in the Pakistan Army.",
  "Khan had collected 4,000 rifles from army supplies and diverted them for",
  "use in Kashmir. More fancifully, he had adopted the nom de guerre \u2018General",
  "Tariq\u2019, after a medieval Moorish warrior who had fought the Christians in",
  "Spain.25",
  "Within Poonch, Muslim officials and soldiers had left their jobs in the",
  "state administration and joined the rebels. So, by the end of September, there",
  "were intimations of a serious conflict between a dissenting district and the",
  "government of Maharaja Hari Singh. But, although there were clashes here",
  "and there, there was no major eruption, no head-on battle. Poonch bordered",
  "West Punjab; Pakistani cities such as Rawalpindi were easily reached from",
  "there. However, the North-West Frontier Province is some distance to the",
  "west. Did the raiders from that province hear of the brewing insurrection in",
  "Poonch? Or were they planning to come anyway?",
  "For these questions too one cannot supply uncontested answers. All we",
  "knowforcertainisthatafterthePathanraiderscrossedtheborderon22Octo-",
  "ber they made remarkably swift progress in their march southwards. \u2018The",
  "principal characteristics of the tribal invasion\u2019, writes the historian Michael",
  "Brecher, \u2018were the surprise tactics of the tribesmen, the absence of the most",
  "rudimentary defence by the Kashmir State Army, and the pillage, loot and",
  "rapine of the tribesmen inflicted on Hindus and Muslims alike.\u2019 Or, as a Brit-",
  "ish social worker familiar with Kashmir laconically put it, the invading Path-",

  "what had happened. This allowed the acting commandant of the state forces,",
  "BrigadierRajinderSingh,togatheracoupleofhundredmenandrushtowards",
  "Uri, a town that lay roughly halfway between Srinagar and Muzaffarabad.",
  "The raiders were on their way to Uri too. Brigadier Rajinder Singh got",
  "there first, and as a precaution blew up the bridge that linked the town to the",
  "north. This held up the invaders for forty-eight hours, but they were eventu-",
  "ally able to cross the river and decimate the brigadier\u2019s men. From Uri they",
  "made their way to Mahuta, the site of the power station that supplied electri-",
  "city to the Valley. There they turned off the switches, plunging Srinagar into",
  "darkness.26",
  "It should not surprise us that estimates of the number of invaders vary.",
  "Some said that they were as few as 2,000, others that they were as many as",
  "13,000. We do know that they had rifles and grenades, and that they trav-",
  "elled in lorries. Their incursion into Kashmir was openly encouraged by the",
  "prime minister of the North-West Frontier Provinces, Abdul Qayyum. The",
  "Britishgovernor,SirGeorgeCunningham,turnedablindeye.SodidtheBrit-",
  "ish officers who then served with the Pakistan army. As Jinnah\u2019s Americ-",
  "an biographer observes, \u2018trucks, petrol, and drivers were hardly standard tri-",

  "northern Pakistan route they traversed knew and supported, even if they did",
  "not actually organize and instigate, the violent October operation by which",
  "Pakistan seems to have hoped to trigger the integration of Kashmir into the",
  "nation\u2019.27",
  "After taking the Mahuta power station on the 24th, the raiders headed",
  "down the open road to Srinagar. En route lay the town of Baramula. Here, for",

  "A British manager of a timber firm in Baramula saw the raiders come, \u2018well",

  "meeting with Jinnah, in which he was told that if India gave up its claim to",
  "Kashmir,Pakistanwouldrelinquishitsclaimonthatotherdisputedstate,Jun-",
  "agadh. Jinnah described Kashmir\u2019s accession to India as based on \u2018fraud and",

  "who were Pakistani citizens; he knew for a fact that Maharaja Hari Singh",
  "wanted independence, and had been forced to accede to India only after his",
  "state was attacked. Jinnah countered by saying that the maharaja had brought",
  "this upon himself by his ill treatment of Muslims in Poonch.40",
  "In Kashmir, meanwhile, the Indian army had thrown a protective ring",
  "around Srinagar. There were now 4,000 troops in position, armed with ma-",

  "With the on set of winter, the military operations were temporarily sus-",
  "pended. Attention now returned to the internal affairs of Kashmir. Mahajan",
  "was still prime minister, but he was being actively assisted by National Con-",
  "ference leaders. On 11 November Nehru wrote to Hari Singh asking him to",
  "place \u2018fullconfidence\u2019 inSheikhAbdullah, that istoformally make himhead",
  "of the administration instead of Mahajan. The \u2018only person who can deliver",
  "the goods in Kashmir is Sheikh Abdullah\u2019, insisted Nehru. \u2018He is obviously",
  "the leading popular personality in Kashmir. The way he has risen to grapple",
  "with the crisis has shown the nature of the man. I have a high opinion of his",

  "the Sikhs on one side, and the Muslims on the other. But the Sheikh Sa-",

  "the hearts of both, by making them forget that there is any difference",

  "Jammu going to India and the rest of the state to Pakistan. A fourth option",
  "had Jammu and the Valleystaying with India, with Poonch and beyond being",
  "ceded to Pakistan. Nehru himself inclined to this last alternative. He saw that",
  "in Poonch \u2018the majority of the population is likely to be against the Indian",
  "Union\u2019. But he was loath to give up the vale of Kashmir, a National Confer-",
  "ence stronghold whose population seemed to be inclined towards India. From",
  "the Indian point of view, said Nehru to the maharaja,",
  "it is of the most vital importance that Kashmir should remain within the",
  "Indian Union . . . But however much we may want this, it cannot bedone ultimately except through the goodwill of the mass of the popu-",
  "lation. Even if military forces held Kashmir for a while, a later conse-",
  "quence might be astrong reaction against this.Essentially, therefore, this",
  "is a problem of psychological approach to the mass of the people and of",
  "making them feel they will be benefited by being in the Indian Union. If",
  "theaverageMuslimfeelsthathehasnosafeorsecureplaceintheUnion,",
  "then obviously he will look elsewhere. Our basic policy must keep this",
  "in view, or else we fail.46",
  "This letter of Nehru\u2019s is much less well known than it should be. Excluded",
  "(for whatever reason) from his own Selected Works, it lies buried in the cor-",
  "respondence of Vallabhbhai Patel, to whom he had sent a copy. It shows that,",
  "contrary to received wisdom, the Indian prime minister was quite prepared to",
  "compromise on Kashmir. Indeed, the four options he outlined in December",
  "1947 remain the four options being debated today.",
  "III",
  "On 1 January 1948 India decided to take the Kashmir issue to the United Na-",
  "tions. This was done on the advice of the governor general, Lord Mountbat-",
  "ten. Since Kashmir had acceded to it, India wanted the UN to help clear the",
  "northern parts of what it said was an illegal occupation by groups loyal to",
  "Pakistan.47",
  "Through January and February the Security Council held several sittings",
  "on Kashmir. Pakistan, represented by the superbly gifted orator Sir Zafrullah",
  "Khan,wasabletopresentafarbettercasethanIndia.Khanconvincedthedel-",
  "egates that the invasion was a consequence of the tragic riots across northern",
  "India in 1946\u20137; it was a \u2018natural\u2019 reaction of Muslims to the sufferings of",
  "their fellows. He accused the Indians of perpetrating \u2018genocide\u2019 in East Pun-",
  "jab, forcing 6 million Muslims to flee to Pakistan. The Kashmir problem was",
  "recast as part of the unfinished business of Partition. India suffered asignific-",
  "ant symbolic defeat when the Security Council altered the agenda item from",
  "the \u2018Jammu and Kashmir Question\u2019 to the \u2018India-Pakistan Question\u2019.",
  "Pakistan now suggested the withdrawal of all armed forces in the state,",
  "and the holding of a plebiscite under an \u2018impartial interim administration.\u2019",
  "Ironically, Pakistan had rejected the idea of a plebiscite in the case of jun-",
  "agadh.Jinnah\u2019spositionthenwasthatthewilloftherulerwoulddecidewhichdominion a princely state would join. India instead referred the matter to the",
  "will of the people. Having done this in junagadh, they could not now so eas-",
  "ily duck the questionin Kashmir. However, the Indian government insisted",
  "a plebiscite could be conducted under a National Conference administration",
  "whose leader, Sheikh Abdullah, was the \u2018most popular political leader in the",
  "State\u2019.48",
  "So said the Sheikh himself, when he spoke at the UnitedNations on 5",
  "February 1948. Hislanguage, recalled one observer, \u2018was blunt, direct, and",
  "devoid of diplomatic language\u2019. \u2018There is no power on earth which can dis-",
  "place me from the position which I have [in Kashmir]\u2019, he told the Security",
  "Council. \u2018As long as the people are behind me I will remain there.\u201949",

  "It was also better placed, with easy access to British air bases in the Middle",
  "East.50",
  "In the first week of March 1948, the editor of the Sunday Times wrote to",
  "Noel-Bakerthat,\u2018intheworldstruggleforandagainstCommunism,Kashmir",

  "By now, Nehru bitterly regretted going to the United Nations. He was",

  "should be \u2018thrown\u2019 into Kashmir.53",
  "Meanwhile, in March 1948 Sheikh Abdullah replaced Mehr Chand Mahajan",
  "as the prime minister of Jammu and Kashmir. Then, in the middle of May,",
  "when the snows had melted, the war recommenced. An infantry brigade ad-",
  "vanced north and west from Uri. It took the town of Tithwal, butmet with",
  "sharp resistance en route to the key town of Muzaffarabad.54",
  "On the otherside of an ever-shiftingline of control, Pakistan had",
  "sponsored a government of Azad (Free) Kashmir. They had also created an",

  "However, an Indian air force squadron was successful in bringing supplies to",
  "Leh. It was also the air force that brought relief to the town of Poonch, in the",
  "west, whose surroundings were under the control of the raiders.55",
  "The two armies battled on through the later months of 1948. In Novem-",
  "ber both Dras and Kargil were recaptured by the Indians, making Leh and",
  "Ladakh safe for the moment.In the same month the hills around Poonch were",
  "also cleared. However, the northern and western parts of Kashmir were still",
  "in the control of Pakistan. Some Indian commanders wanted to move on,",
  "and asked for the redeployment of three brigades from the plains. Their re-",
  "quest was not granted. For one thing, winter was about to set in. For another,",
  "the offensive would have required not merely troop reinforcements, but also",
  "massive air support.56 Perhaps it was as well that the Indian Army halted its",
  "forward movement. For, as a scholar closely following the Kashmir question",

  "Kashmir. Its members made an extensive tour of the region, visiting Delhi,",
  "Karachi and Kashmir. In Srinagar they were entertained by Sheikh Abdullah",
  "at the famous Shalimar Gardens. Later, Abdullah had a long talk with one",
  "of the UN representatives, the Czech diplomat and scholar Josef Korbel. The",
  "prime minister dismissed both a plebiscite and independence, arguing that the\u2018only solution\u2019 was the partition of Kashmir. Otherwise, said Abdullah, \u2018the",

  "Kashmir and India. In May 1948 he organized a week-long \u2018freedom\u2019 celeb-",

  "had no roots in what was now their state. This, one suspects, made them even",
  "more fervent in their desire to make Kashmir part of Pakistan.",
  "However, the new Indian nation-state was not so robusteither. Its insec-",
  "urity was manifest in its anointing, as a secular hero, of a Muslim officer who",

  "who was withal \u2018a vegetarian,a non-smoker, and a teetotaller . His body was",
