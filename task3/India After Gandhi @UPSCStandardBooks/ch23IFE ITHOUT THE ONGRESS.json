  "Even as Mrs Gandhi spoke over the radio, her opponents were being re-",
  "leased from jails across the country. The next day, 19 January, the leaders of",
  "four parties met at the residence of Morarji Desai in New Delhi. These parties",
  "were the Jana Sangh, the Bharatiya Lok Dal (a party principally of farmers,",

  "\u2018Janata (Peoples) Party\u2019 was formally launched at a news conference in the",
  "presence of Jayaprak-ash Narayan.1",
  "Ten days after the formation of the Janata Party, Jagjivan Ram announced",
  "that he was leaving the Union government. Known universally as \u2018Babuji\u2019,",
  "Ram was a lifelong Congressman, a prominent minister in Nehru\u2019s and Indira",
  "Gandhi\u2019s Cabinets and \u2013 most crucially \u2013 the acknowledged leader of the",
  "Scheduled Castes, the former Untouchables who made up some 15 per cent of",
  "the electorate. It was Ram who had moved the resolution in the Lok Sabha en-",
  "dorsingtheemergency.HisresignationcameasashocktotheCongress,andas",
  "a harbinger of things to come. For Babuji was renowned for his political acu-",
  "men; that he chose to leave the Congress was widely taken as a sign that this",
  "ship was, if not yet sinking, then leaking very badly indeed. In resigning from",
  "his old party Ram formed a new one: the Congress for Democracy. The CFD,",
  "he said, would collaborate with the Janata Party regarding candidates in order",
  "to avoid the Congress gaining from a split opposition vote.",

  "Asked for a message to the weekly\u2019s readers, Narayan said they should vote",
  "without fear, and remember that \u2018if you vote for the Opposition you will vote",

  "Thechiefprotagonistsoftheconflictsof1973\u20135werealsothechiefcam-",

  "Bombay, Chandigarh, Hyderabad, Indore, Poona and Ratlam \u2013 pausing only",
  "to spend time with his dialysis machine. Everywhere, he warned the audience",

  "\u2018nineteen months of tyranny shall become nineteen years of terror\u2019.4 In her",
  "speeches Mrs Gandhi denied that her party was the monopoly of one fam-",
  "ily. In any case, \u2018few families in the world\u2019 had a comparable record of ser-",
  "vice and sacrifice. She admitted that there had been some excesses during the",
  "emergency, yet defended the regime as necessary at the time. \u2018We don\u2019t care",
  "who criticises us\u2019, she insisted. \u2018We have to proceed on the right path guided",
  "by sound policies, programmes and principles.\u20195",
  "At least in northern India, the elections were inevitably seen as a ref-",
  "erendum on those policies and programmes; and on one programme in par-",
  "ticular, that of compulsory sterilization. There was, reported one journalist, a",
  "\u2018burning hatred against forced vasectomies\u2019; this extremely emotive and ex-",
  "plosive issue\u2019 had \u2018become the focus of all pent-up frustrations and resent-",

  "jay Gandhi? asked one -In the land of Gandhi and Nehru, who is this impost-",
  "or Sanjay Gandhi? Particularly active in the election campaign were school",
  "teachers and lower officials, those who had their promotions stopped or were",
  "punitively transferred for not having met the \u2018quotas\u2019 (of males to be steril-",
  "ized) assigned them by the administration.6",
  "On the night of 20 March 1977 the election results were posted outside",
  "newspaper offices in Delhi as they came in. The next day\u2019s papers reported",
  "that the crowds \u2018were partisan and loudly pro-Janata\u2019, cheering as \u2018the king-",
  "pins of the Congress Party tumbled one after another\u2019. When news of Mrs",
  "Gandhi\u2019s defeat in her previously safe seat of Rae Bareilli was announced,",
  "\u2018the people in high spirits thronging the streets began shouting slogans and",
  "bursting crackers\u2019. The news of Sanjay Gandhi\u2019s defeat was followed by",
  "louder cheers and more prolonged celebrations still. Mrs Gandhi had lost to",
  "her old foe and litigant Raj Narain; in the adjoining constituency of Amethi,",
  "Sanjay had been defeated by an obscure student leader.7",
  "The defeats of mother and son were part of a wider washout of the Con-",
  "gress in Uttar Pradesh. They lost all 85 seats in the state, and all 54 seats in",
  "neighbouring Bihar, to the Janata\u2013CFD alliance. In Rajasthan the Congress",
  "won one seat out of 25; in Madhya Pradesh one out of 40. These losses were",
  "partly offset by a robust performance in southern India, where the emergency",
  "had rested lightly. In Andhra Pradesh the Congress won 41 seats out of 42;",
  "in Karnataka, 26 out of 28; in Kerala, 11 out of 20; in Tamil Nadu, 14 out",
  "of 39. The Janata surge had scarcely dented the south; still, given the higher",
  "populationdensitiesandseatsharesofthenorthernstates,intheaggregatethe",
  "Congress fell far short of a majority. They won 153 seats in a house of 540,",
  "down more than 200 from the 1971 elections. On the other side, as many as",
  "298 Janata and CFD candidates were successful.8",
  "The elections had revealed a manifest regional divide, and also a divide",
  "bycaste and religious affiliation. Twogroupsin particular,long considered to",
  "be loyal \u2018vote banks\u2019 of the ruling party, had this time deserted the Congress.",
  "One was the Scheduled Castes, many of whom were swayed into voting for",
  "JanatabythedefectionofJagjivanRam.TheotherwastheMuslims,whohad",
  "suffered grievously at the hands of Sanjay\u2019s pet programmes. When elections",
  "werecalled,theinfluentialImamofDelhi\u2019sgreatestmosque,theJamaMasjid,asked Muslims to vote against the Congress. This they mostly did, contribut-",
  "ing in good measure to the party\u2019s disastrous showing in northern India.9",
  "Sober commentators spoke of a \u2018Janata wave\u2019; less sober ones, of a \u2018re-",
  "volution\u2019. For the first time in the nation\u2019s thirty-year history, a party other",
  "than the Congress would govern at the centre. No Indian alive in 1977 knew",
  "whatitwaslikenottohavetheCongressasthecountry\u2019sdominantandruling",
  "political party.Fewknewwhat it waslike nottohave NehruorIndira Gandhi",
  "as its dominant and ruling political figure.",
  "The results of the elections delighted many, angered some and surprised",
  "all. In a letter to a friend Mrs Gandhi attributed her defeat to malign forces.",
  "\u2018People have always thought that I was imagining things and overreacting\u2019,",
  "shewrote,\u2018buttherehasbeenadeepconspiracyanditwasboundtoovertake",
  "us.\u201910 One editor who had been among her most steadfast supporters took the",

  "II",
  "Unlike the Congress, the Janata Party had not fought the elections under a",
  "single leader. After the results were in, a controversy arose as to who should",
  "be chosen prime minister. The supporters of Charan Singh felt that the sweep",
  "in northern India made him the logical choice. Jagjivan Ram\u2019s men argued",
  "thatsincehisdefectionhadbeendecisiveheshouldbeconsidered.Thenthere",
  "wasMorarji Desai, whohadalmost become prime minister in1964andagain",
  "in 1967.",
  "The last week of March saw hectic canvassing on behalf of the three",
  "candidates. Finally, it was decided that the Grand Old Men behind Janata,",
  "JayaprakashNarayanandJ.B.Kripalaniwouldmakethechoice.Theysettled",
  "onDesai,whohadunparalleledadministrativeexperienceaswellasaspotless",
  "personal record. Jagjivan Ram was offered the prestigious Defence portfolio,",
  "Charan Singh the powerful Home Ministry. Finance went to the old civil ser-vant H. M. Patel, External Affairs to the Jana Sangh leader Atal Behari Va-",
  "jpayee.",
  "What would be the policies of the new government? It was hard to pre-",
  "dict, since within both party and Cabinet there was a veritable mishmash of",
  "ideologies: some baiting Nehru, others praising him, some talking about the",
  "commanding heights of the public sector, and others brashly championing the",
  "JapaneseandAmericanmodels,\u2018someassertingtheneedforheavyindustries,",
  "other clamouring for a \u201creturn to the villages\u201d\u2019.12 The importance of Charan",
  "Singh signalled an anti-urban bias, and the Planning Commission was now",
  "dominated by economists who specialized in agriculture rather than industry.",
  "The importance of the socialists signalled a hard time for foreign capital; in-",
  "deed, the industries minister, the fiery trade union leader George Fernandes,",
  "announced that the American multinationals Coca-Cola and IBM would both",
  "be made to quit India (which, in due course, they were).",
  "Among the more pragmatic ministers was Madhu Dandavate, who was",
  "put in charge of the railways. This was the branch of government which ser-",
  "viced more Indians than any other, and none too well either. Dandavate too",
  "was a socialist, but his socialism eschewed rhetoric against the rich in favour",
  "ofpoliciesforthepoor.Asheputit,\u2018whatIwanttodoisnotdegradethefirst",
  "class but elevate the second class\u2019. Dandavate initiated the computerization",
  "of railway reservations, which reduced corruption among booking clerks and",
  "uncertainty among passengers. He set in motion the repair or replacement of",
  "5,000 kilometres of worn-out tracks. But his most far-reaching measure was",

  "In the government\u2019s early months observers waited with keen anticipa-",
  "tion for a shift in foreign policy. The day after the election results were an-",
  "nounced, the New YorkTimes wrote that, whereas the attitude ofthe Congress",
  "towards the West had varied from a self-righteous edginess\u2019 to \u2018a chilliness",
  "bordering on hostility\u2019, \u2018all indications\u2019 from the Janata alliance were that \u2018a",
  "friendly attitude can be expected towards the United States, with a noticeable",
  "coolingoffeelingsfortheSovietUnion\u2019.Americanstrategistsweresalivating",
  "at the prospect of a China\u2013India\u2013US alliance against the Soviet Union. The",
  "Janata victory, they thought, \u2018represented] something of a windfall for Wash-",
  "ington\u2019.14Themistakebeingmadeherewastoequateonefamilywiththenationas",
  "a whole. Washington believed it was only the personal choices of Jawaharlal",
  "Nehru and his daughter that explained the alliance with the Soviets. In truth,",
  "this had also to do with amore general scepticism regarding American inten-",
  "tions, caused both by its support of Pakistan and by the Indian intellectual\u2019s",
  "distaste for unbridled capitalism. Besides, the threat from China meant that",
  "New Delhi could scarcely turn its back on Moscow.",
  "The Janata leaders did not want to reject the Soviets for the Americans,",
  "but to move towards aprincipled equidistance from the superpowers. As the",
  "influential editor (and JP biographer) Ajit Bhattacharjea remarked, the chal-",
  "lenge for the new regime was \u2018to correct the tilt non-alignment had acquired",
  "over the years towards the Soviet Union without, if possible, antagonising",
  "Moscow\u2019.15 Thus in October 1977 Morarji Desai and A. B. Vajpayee together",
  "visited the Soviet Union to underline that the relationship between the two",
  "countries was much more than a familial one.",
  "At the same time, overtures were also made to the other side. The jurist",
  "Nani Palkhivala, known for his pro-Western and free-market orientation, was",
  "sent as ambassador to Washington. In reciprocation, Jimmy Carter came to",
  "India in January 1978, the first American president to do so since Eisen-",
  "hower. In a moving address to the Indian Parliament he spoke of the \u2018com-",
  "monality of our fundamental values\u2019, and of how both countries had recently",
  "passed through \u2018grave crises\u2019 (namely, Watergate and the emergency) yet",
  "comethroughwiththeircommitmenttodemocracyintact.Then,inaspontan-",
  "eous coda to his prepared text, he spoke of the debt owed by Martin Luther",
  "King\u2019s civil rights struggle to the ideas of Mahatma Gandhi.16",
  "The Janata government also sought to mend fences with India\u2019s neigh-",
  "bours. In November 1977 India and Bangladesh signed an agreement for the",
  "sharingoftheGangawaters,whichgavetheformer20,500cubicfeetofwater",
  "duringtheleanseason,andthelatter34,500cubicfeet.Theaccordwassigned",
  "over the protests of the state government of West Bengal, which claimed that",
  "Calcutta port would silt up if denied adequate water.17 In February 1978 For-",
  "eign Minister Vajpayee visited Pakistan, where he charmed his hosts, the dic-",
  "tator General Zia-ul-Haq included, who had assumed that a man reared in the",
  "Jana Sangh would exhibit a fanatical hatred towards Muslims.18 A year later",
  "Vajpayee visited China, the highest-ranking Indian to do so since the border",
  "war of 1962. On this occasion, however, the trip was marred by the Chinese",
  "attack on Vietnam, launched in arrogant disregard of India\u2019s long friendship",
  "with the country being invaded.Oneconomicpolicythejanatagovernmentwaslessthanunified;onfor-",
  "eign policy a little more so. The greatest consensus was on the new regime\u2019s",
  "treatmentoftheformerprimeminister.TheJanataleadersweredeterminedto",
  "make Mrs Gandhi pay for having imposed the emergency. As many as eight",
  "Commissions of Enquiry were appointed, each headed by a retired judge.",
  "Several dealt with the corruption of Congress chief ministers, one with the",
  "treatment of JP in jail and one, absurdly, with the possible maltreatment in a",

  "congressism\u2019Ram-manoharLohia.Therewasalsoacommissionsetuptoen-",
  "quire into the affairs of Sanjay Gandhi\u2019s Maruti company.",
  "The enquiry with the widest ambit was the Shah Commission, set up",
  "to punish those guilty of the excesses of the emergency. It was headed by",
  "a former chief justice of the Supreme Court, justice J. C. Shah. It met in a",
  "courtroomofPatialaHouse,incentralDelhi,wherethewhite-hairedjudgesat",
  "on a raised platform flanked by two assistants. Below him, on a table with a",
  "microphone, sat the witness of the day, his testimony heard by a crowd com-",
  "posed mostly of journalists.19",
  "In its first few months the Shah Commission examined scores of wit-",
  "nesses: bureaucrats, police officers, municipal officials, members of Mrs",
  "Gandhi\u2019s Cabinet. But the lady herself refused to testify. Three times she was",
  "calledtothewitnessbox;threetimesshecame,andchosenottoanswerques-",
  "tions, claiming she was bound by the oath of Cabinet secrecy. A journal vic-",
  "timized during the emergency saw this as \u2018an outrageous attempt to make a",
  "mockery of the proceedings of the Commission\u2019.20 A journalist more sym-",
  "pathetic to the other side sarcastically commented that the \u2018Shah Commission",

  "name of the Shah Commission is mentioned.\u201921",
  "III",
  "The change of government at the centre presaged changes of regime in the",
  "provinces as well. Following Mrs Gandhi\u2019s lead in 1971, Janata dismissed",
  "state governments across northern India, claiming that the results of the gen-",
  "eral election showed that these had \u2018lost the confidence of the people\u2019. Infreshelectionsheldtothestateassemblies,JanatawoneasilyinUttarPradesh,",

  "New Delhi. Now they faced no such problem, and could set about effecting",

  "Previously, the landlord would take half or more of the crop from the tenant;",
  "afterthereforms,thissharewasreducedto25percent,with75percentbeing",
  "retained by the bargadar. More than a million poor peasants benefited from",
  "the reforms.",
  "Meanwhile, the Left Front also conducted elections to village panchay-",
  "ats. Panchayati Raj, or local self-government, was a stated policy of the gov-",
  "ernment, mandated by the constitution, but honoured mostly in the breach.",
  "Thepanchayatelectionsof1977inWestBengalwerethefirstconductedwith",
  "such seriousness and on such a wide scale. As many as 55,000 seats were",
  "contested for, with Left Front candidates winning two-thirds of them. Not-",
  "ably, most of those elected on the communist ticket were not sharecroppers",
  "but small landholders, teachers and social workers, members of what, in clas-",
  "sicalMarxistparlance,wouldbetermedthe\u2018pettybourgeoisie\u2019.Buttheywere",
  "party members or sympathizers withal. Along with Operation Barga, the pan-",
  "chayat elections helped deepen the hold of the Left Front over the Bengal",
  "countryside.23",
  "There was also a change of regime in Tamil Nadu. Here the DMK had",
  "ruled for a decade before being dismissed on spurious grounds during the",
  "emergency. In the elections now called, their main rivals were the AIADMK,",
  "a breakaway from the parent party led and completely identified with the le-",
  "gendary film star M. G. Ramachandran. In the polls, the superior organiza-",
  "tional machine of the DMK proved no match for the charisma and appeal of",
  "MGR. The AIADMK won 130 seats to its rival\u2019s 48. MGR quickly made itclear that the old slogans of \u2018Northern/Hindi imperialism\u2019 were now out of",

  "In the east, communists were becoming reconciled to bourgeois demo-",
  "cracy; in the south, erstwhile secessionists to making their peace with the In-",
  "dian nation-state. And there were also hopeful developments in regions and",
  "among peoples traditionally more truculent still. In the summer of 1977 Mor-",
  "arji Desai met the Naga leader A. Z. Phizo in London; although no settlement",
  "was reached, the fact that the two met, and in a foreign country, was seen as a",
  "significant concession by the Indian Government. Later in the year assembly",
  "elections were held in Nagaland. The 82-year-old Desai went to campaign,",

  "IVInthewinterof1978/9theSwisseconomistGilbertEtiennetravelledthrough",
  "the Indian countryside, visiting villages he had studied a decade and a half",
  "previously. He found a marked contrast between, on the one hand, \u2018dynamic\u2019",
  "areas such as western Uttar Pradesh and the Cauvery delta of Tamil Nadu",
  "and, on the other, \u2018slow or no growth\u2019 areas such as eastern Uttar Pradesh",
  "and Orissa. What seemed crucial to rural prosperity was water management.",
  "Where irrigation facilities had been extended, productivity had risen, and in-",
  "comes and lifestyles with it. Apart from water, a key input was chemical fer-",
  "tilizers, the consumption of which had increased fourfold in the \u2018Green Re-",
  "volution\u2019 districts.",
  "The gains from agricultural growth, discovered Etienne, had accrued",
  "chiefly to the rising \u2018backward\u2019 castes \u2013 such as the jats in UP, the Kurmis",
  "and Yadavs in Bihar, the Marathas in Maharashtra and the Vellalas in Tamil",
  "Nadu. The upperor \u2018forward\u2019 castes, who once owned much land, had relo-",

  "entative here were the Musahars of Bihar. Etienne found that \u2018their children",
  "were malnourished and the caste generated an air of acute misery\u2019.28",
  "Etienne reported that one of the most dynamic schemes\u2019 in rural India",
  "sought to increase the production of milk by producers\u2019 cooperatives. This",
  "had its origins in a project started in the 1940s in the village of Anand, in",
  "central Gujarat. In the 1950s the co-operatives came to cover the whole of",
  "the Kaira district in which Anand fell. The milk they produced went to the",
  "city of Bombay, five hours away by express train. The success of this scheme",
  "(known as \u2018AMUL\u2019, with the first letter standing for the village where it",
  "began) prompted a country wide extension, given the evocative name Oper-",
  "ation Flood. At the beginning of the decade there were 1,000 co-operatives",
  "involving240,000farmersandproducing176millionlitresofmilkeachyear;",

  "These figures led some enthusiasts to speak of a White Revolution that",
  "hadcomplementedtheGreenone.Intruth,likethatotherrevolutionthegains",
  "from this one were very unevenly distributed. The scheme worked well in",
  "Tamil Nadu, a state with good rail and road facilities and a large urban popu-",
  "lation. In states with poorer infrastructure the results were disappointing. And",
  "everywhere it was the middle and rich farmers who had gained most; that is,those who had access to more fodder (in the shape of crop residues from their",
  "lands), more space to keep cows and buffaloes, and better access to credit.29",
  "The commercialization of agriculture and milk production had benefited",
  "a significant section of farmers in rural India. Crucially, economic gains had",
  "converted themselves into political ambition. In the 1960s it was these rising",
  "ruralcasteswhocametodominatethestategovernmentsinnorthernIndia.By",
  "the 1970s they had made their presence felt in national politics. In the Janata",
  "dispensation the force of rural assertion was \u2018dramatically represented in the",
  "personality and ideology of Charan Singh\u2019. But it ran deeper than that of one",
  "man.Afterthe1977LokSabhaelections,36percentofallmembersofParlia-",

  "pact was felt in the rural orientation of the government\u2019s economic policies,",
  "as in the ever higher procurement price paid by the state for wheat and rice.30",
  "V",
  "Some commentators interpreted this rising rural power in class terms. They",
  "saw \u2018urban-rural struggles\u2019 and a sharpening of the conflict between factory",
  "owners and farmers. The terms of trade between industry and agriculture,",
  "oncesoheavilyweightedinfavouroftheformer,werenowtiltingtowardsthe",
  "latter.31 But this was also, and perhaps more significantly, a conflict that ran",
  "along the lines of caste.",
  "Infact,whenviewedintermsofcasteratherthanclass,onecouldidenti-",
  "fy two distinct axes of conflict. The first was in the sphere of politics and ad-",
  "ministration, where the backwards sought to contest the pre-eminence previ-",
  "ouslyenjoyed bytheforwardcastes suchasBrahmins, Rajputs, Kayasths and",
  "Banias, who had historically enjoyed a monopoly over literacy, scholarship,",
  "commerce and the exercise of political power.",
  "The national movement had been dominated by the forward castes so,",
  "when Independence came, government both at the centre and in the states",
  "wasdominatedbythemtoo.Slowlythepressuresofrepresentativedemocracy",
  "pushed forward the claims of those lower in status but more substantial in",
  "numbers. More chief ministers in the states came now from the backward",
  "castes. So did an increasing number of Cabinet ministers at the centre. One",
  "citadel remained unconquered: the office of prime minister. Like Nehru and",
  "Indira before him, Morarji Desai was from the highest-ranked Brahmin caste.(Although not a Brahmin, Lal Bahadur Shastri was a Kayasth, from an elite",
  "caste of scribes.)",
  "In south India, a system of affirmative action, first instituted under co-",
  "lonial rule, had restricted the proportion of state jobs that the forwards castes",
  "could fill. Now the Janata regime sought to extend this system to their own",
  "strongholds in the north. In Bihar a commission set up in the early 1970s had",
  "recommended that 26 per cent of all posts in the administration be reserved",
  "for the backward castes. The report had been buried during the emergency.",
  "After the victory of the Janata Party in Bihar in 1977, the new chief minister,",
  "Karpoori Thakur, disinterred the report and decided to implement its recom-",
  "mendations.",
  "Thakur\u2019s decision led to a storm of protest from the forward castes. Ra-",
  "jput and Bhumihar students burnt buses and trains and vandalized govern-",
  "ment buildings. The backward caste leaders were unyielding. Their resolve",
  "was strengthened by their strong representation in the state legislature, where",
  "nearly 40 per cent of the members came from castes that would benefit from",
  "the extension of reservation. As one politician put it, \u2018our movement is not",
  "only for reservation, it is for capturing political power in north India and in",
  "Delhi\u2019. Indeed, under pressure from the backward-caste lobby within Janata,",
  "Morarji Desai had appointed a commission to examine whether reservation",
  "should be extended to central government jobs too. As mandated by the con-",
  "stitution, 15 per cent of these jobs went to Scheduled Castes and 7.5 per cent",
  "toScheduledTribes;nowthebackwardswantedashareaswell.Thecommis-",
  "sion that would look into this matter was headed by a Bihar politician, B. P.",
  "Mandal.32",
  "Beyond the backward/forward divide, Bihar had become a metaphor for",
  "all that was wrong in India. Leading articles complained about the \u2018deteri-",
  "orating law and order in the districts\u2019, of the corruption and inefficiency of",
  "government officials, of the instability of the state\u2019s politics (as many as nine",
  "chief ministers had been sworn in since 1967), all of which made Bihar \u2018a pi-",
  "tifully poor state\u2019. Its present condition was contrasted with the halcyon days",
  "of yore, when Bihar had produced the Buddha, the emperor Ashoka and the",
  "great Mauryan Empire. Now, alas, \u2018the only time Bihar ever manages to hit",
  "the headlines is either when it is devastated by floods and famine or, when",
  "nature takes arespite, there arereports aboutcoalmine tragedies, atrocities on",
  "Harijans, and corruption\u2019.33VI",
  "Those atrocities were a consequence of the sharpening of a second kind of",
  "casteconflict\u2013thatbetweenthebackwardsontheonesideandtheScheduled",
  "Castes or Harijans on the other. This conflict too had a material basis; it was",
  "the former who mostly owned the land, and the latter who mostly laboured",
  "on it. Beyond disputes about wages and working conditions, this was also a",
  "dispute about dignity. The backwards slipped easily into the shoes of the for-",
  "wards whose land they had gained. Like them, they treated the Harijans with",
  "disdainandoftenviolatedtheirwomen.Atonetimethelowestcasteshadhad",
  "no option but to suffer in silence. However, the expansion of education, and",
  "the spaces opened up by political representation, meant that the younger Har-",
  "ijans were \u2018no longer ready to put up with contempt, abuse, beating and oth-",
  "er forms of insult which were accepted by earlier generations as a matter of",
  "course\u2019.34",
  "There had been a dramatic increase in the number of attacks on Harijans",
  "since the new government assumed power in New Delhi. In the ten years",
  "that Mrs Gandhi was in power the number of reported incidents was 40,000.",
  "Between April 1977, when Janata assumed office, and September 1978,",
  "17,775 cases of \u2018atrocities against Harijans\u2019 were reported. It was estimated",
  "that two-thirds of these reports were from the north, in states where Janata re-",
  "gimes were in power.35",
  "The most serious conflict, however, took place in Marathwada, the arid,",
  "interior districts of Maharashtra that had once formed part of the Nizam\u2019s",

  "This dramatic gesture brought Indira Gandhi decisively back to the",
  "centre of the political stage. As one of her opponents later recalled, her visit",
  "to Belchi served several purposes. It helped damn the Janata Government as",
  "being indifferent to the fate of the poor and the Harijans. The ride refurbished",
  "Indira Gandhi\u2019s image as a friend of the poor and the lowly. It also showed to",
  "the average member of the Congress Party that Indira Gandhi was a woman",
  "of action and she alone could be trusted to lead the fight back to power.\u201939The visit to Belchi was her own initiative, but Mrs Gandhi\u2019s revival was",
  "alsohelpedbyalessinspiredinitiativeofthegovernmentinpower.Inthefirst",

  "with this piece of paper, the police went to Mrs Gandhi\u2019s house and took her",
  "into custody. Their plan was to drive her to a rest house in the neighbouring",
  "state of Haryana. On the way they were forced to stop at a railway crossing.",
  "Mrs Gandhi got out and sat down on a culvert. Her lawyers, meanwhile, told",
  "the police their warrant did not permit them to take their client out of Delhi.",
  "An argument ensued, conducted in the presence of many interested bystand-",
  "ers. Eventually the police conceded the point, and the party drove back to the",
  "capital.",
  "Mrs Gandhi was kept overnight by the police, but when they produced",
  "her before a magistrate the next morning, he threw out the charge sheet as",
  "flimsy and insubstantial. The bungled \u2018arrest\u2019 redounded badly on the Janata",
  "government, and helped redeem the reputation of their hated opponent. She",
  "began making combative speeches against the new regime, singling out the",
  "increase in crime and inflation (running at double-digit levels), and the prof-",
  "iteering of hoarders and black-marketeers. The deposed prime minister, com-",
  "mented the New York Times in the last week of October, \u2018has been speaking",
  "more and more boldly lately, trying to assume once more the posture of ana-",
  "tionalleader\u2019.40",
  "Mrs Gandhi\u2019s resurgence alarmed Janata, as well as many leaders in her",
  "own party. Some Congress ministers had already testified against her before",
  "the Shah Commission. In January 1978 the Congress formally split into two",
  "factions, those who stayed with Mrs Gandhi forming the \u2018Congress (Indira)\u2019.",
  "The next month this party easily won state elections in Andhra Pradesh and",
  "Karnataka. The former prime minister had been the chief campaigner; as the",
  "results showed, at least in the south her image as a saviour of the poor, the",
  "adivasi, the Scheduled Castes and women was firmly intact.41",
  "Mrs Gandhi now began looking around for a safe seat via which to re-",
  "enter Parliament. Eventually she chose the constituency of Chikmaglur, in",
  "the coffee belt of Karnataka. The state\u2019s chief minister, Devaraj Urs, had a",
  "high reputation for efficiency; among his achievements was the bestowing of",
  "ownership rights to hundreds of thousands of tenant-cultivators. The work of",
  "Urs and her own, largely unimpaired, standing in south India persuaded Mrs",
  "Gandhi to seek election at the other end of the country from her native Uttar",
  "Pradesh.42Standing against the former prime minister was a former (and much re-",
  "spected) chief minister of Karnataka, Veerendra Patil. Leading Patil\u2019s cam-",

  "stituency till the polling is over,\u2019 declared Fernandes to a reporter. \u2018We must",
  "defeat her.\u2019 Mrs Gandhi took the challenge seriously; as the same journalist",
  "reported, she \u2018smiles graciously at the women and children, accepts garlands",
  "at hundreds of roadside meetings, makes detours to visit numerous places of",
  "worship, calls on saints of all denominations\u2019.43",
  "In the event, Mrs Gandhi won easily. No sooner had she re-entered the",
  "Lok Sabha than she had to face a \u2018privilege motion\u2019 against her. A Parlia-",
  "mentaryCommittee,stackedwithJanatamembers,reportedthatbackin1974,",
  "whenshewasprimeminister,MrsGandhihadobstructedaninquiryintoSan-",
  "jay\u2019s Maruti factory, and deliberately misled Parliament while doing so. Her",
  "punishment was left to the \u2018wisdom of the House\u2019. The Janata majority de-",
  "cided that she must be sent to jail for a week. The spell in prison, ruled the",
  "election commissioner, meant that she would have to resign her seat. This",
  "precipitated another by-election in Chikmaglur; once again Mrs Gandhi con-",
  "tested, and won.44",
  "VIII",
  "Janata\u2019s attempts to humiliate the former prime minister were seriously mis-",
  "judged. The stoicism with which Mrs Gandhi bore her sufferings was much",

  "of vision.",
  "Behind the attempts to arrest the former prime minister lay personal",
  "rivalries within the Janata camp. The home minister, Charan Singh, was not",
  "reconciled tobeingnumbertwointheCabinet. Hismoveagainst MrsGandhi",
  "was a move to steal the thunder from Morarji Desai. He opened another flank",
  "in the same battle when he wrote to the prime minister complaining about",
  "the growing influence of Desai\u2019s son Kanti. Kanti lived with his father, and",
  "handled his appointments. Unflattering comparisons were made with the role",
  "once played by Sanjay Gandhi.Through the first half of 1978 Charan Singh and Morarji Desai, home",
  "minister and prime minister respectively, exchanged a series of angry letters.",
  "Eventually,inJune1978,DesaiwascompelledtosackSinghfromtheCabin-",
  "et, along withhis chief lieutenant Raj Narain. Others within Janata tried to",
  "broker a peace, but to no avail. In December, Singh emerged from months of",
  "seclusion to organize a massive farmers\u2019 rally in the capital. Some 200,000",

  "the Socialist Party, mostly sided with Singh; another, the Jana Sangh, decided",
  "to back Desai. Deepening the rift was the question of \u2018dual membership\u2019,",
  "the growing feeling that the Jana Sangh members of the Janata Party owed",

  "1977, Atal Behari Vajpayee had proclaimed that his old party was \u2018dead and",
  "buried\u2019. But the feeling persisted that it was the RSS that directed the actions",
  "of Janata MPs and ministers who had a Jana Sangh background. They were",
  "asked to disavow their ties with the RSS, which they refused to do on the",
  "grounds that the Sangh was merely a \u2018cultural\u2019 body.",
  "In the third week of July 1979 the Socialists chose to sit in a separate",
  "group in Parliament. This catalysed a split in Janata, a loss of majority for",

  "withdrawing support. It took the president a further month to explore and re-",
  "ject the alternatives. When he decided that amid-term poll was the only solu-",
  "tion, the Election Commission still needed time to prepare for it. So Charan",
  "Singh stayed on as prime minister until the end of the year, two full months",
  "more than Himmat had given him.",

  "within a year of its formation.50",
  "Looking back on the three years of the Janata regime, one analyst re-",
  "membered it as \u2018a chronicle of confused and complex party squabbles, intra-",
  "party rivalries, shifting alliances, defections, charges and countercharges of",
  "incompetence and the corruption and humiliation of persons who had come",
  "to power after the defeat of Mrs Gandhi\u2019.51 Most Indians who lived through",
  "those years would make the same assessment, if more succinctly; the Janata",
  "Party, they would say, were merely a bunch of jokers. It takes a distinguished",
  "foreign observer to remind us that, beyond the fighting and squabbling, the",
  "Janata government made a notable contribution to Indian democracy. This, in",
  "the words of Gran-ville Austin, was its \u2018remarkable success in repairing the",

  "inism was widespread as well as wide ranging, with groups active in many",
  "states, mobilizing support through public rallies, street theatre, poster cam-",
  "paigns and house-to-house canvassing.55",
  "The late seventies also saw the assertion of avigorous environmental",
  "movement. Peasants launched struggles in defence of their forest rights, tri-",
  "bals protested against their displacement by large industrial projects and ar-",
  "tisanal fisherfolk opposed trawlers that were depleting the fish stocks of the",
  "ocean. In these protests two things stood out: the leading role of women, who",
  "themselves bore the brunt of ecological degradation, and the fact that, unlike",
  "in the West, where the concern for nature was couched in aesthetic terms and",
  "voiced by the middle class, this was an \u2018environmentalism of the poor\u2019, driv-en by rural communities for whom access to the gifts of nature was linked to",
  "their very survival.56",
  "Both the feminist movement and the environmental movement actually",
  "started in the early 1970s. Their progress was interrupted by the emergency,",
  "but when that ended they emerged once more and with renewed vigour. The",
  "same was the case with the civil rights movement. This had its origins in the",
  "treatment of Naxalite activists incarcerated in Calcutta jail. When these pris-",
  "onersbeganabidi-chittiandolan,astruggleforaccesstocigarettesandletters",
  "(denied them by their jailers), are tired engineer named Kapil Bhattacharya",
  "decided to form an Association for the Protection of Democratic Rights. The",
  "emergency inspired the formation of other such groups, based in Delhi, Bom-",
  "bay, Hyderabad and elsewhere. Some focused on \u2018civil liberties\u2019, the viol-",
  "ation by the state of the basic human rights of its citizens. Others worked",
  "with a broader concept of \u2018democratic rights\u2019, which took the right to life and",
  "liberty guaranteed by the constitution also to mean the right to better wages",
  "and working conditions, and to gainful employment itself. The first kind of",
  "group took up jail reform and the abuse of power by state authorities (and the",
  "policeinparticular);thesecondkindalsolookedattheimpactofstatepolicies",
  "onthelivesandlivelihoodsofthelessprivileged,thelowcastesandtribalsin",
  "particular. These groups produced dozens of reports on the violations of civil",
  "liberties and democratic rights by the state, drawing on field investigations,",
  "ofteninremotepartsofthecountry,conductedbypublic-spiritedintellectuals",
  "based in the cities.57",
  "These movements were described as \u2018new\u2019 because they took up issues",
  "neglected by the old, class-based social movements of peasants and workers.",
  "However, the late 1970s also saw those older concerns expressing themselves",
  "innewforms.Thusthetradeunionmovement,whichhadhistoricallyfocused",
  "on the factory sector, now began working among miners and labourers in",
  "household and cottage industries. Among the more notable initiatives was",
  "the Chattisgarh Mineworkers Shramik Sangh (CMSS), whose leader Shankar",
  "GuhaNiyogisoughttoblendtheideasofGandhiandMarx.Themineswhere",
  "the CMSS was active serviced the great public-sector steelworks at Bhilai.",
  "Working with miners of a chiefly tribal background, Niyogi campaigned for",
  "equal pay for women workers and against alcohol abuse by men, set up",
  "schools for children, and struggled to make the mine owners pay as much at-",
  "tention to health and safety as to a decent living wage.58",
  "Accompanying and complementing these movements was a new kind of",
  "Indian press. For the end of the emergency unleashed the energies of journal-",
  "istsasonlythestrugglefornationalindependencehaddonebeforeit.Censor-ship was dead; there were now no limits to what reporters and editors could",
  "write about, or to the length of their stories. It also helped that the first offset",
  "presses arrived in India in the 1970s. No longer had type to be laboriously set",
  "in hot metal; no longer had journals to be printed in the bigger towns and cit-",
  "ies alone.",
  "The historian Robin Jeffrey has authoritatively tracked \u2018India\u2019s Newspa-",
  "per Revolution\u2019 which began in 1977 and has gathered pace ever since.",
  "Among the components of this revolution we may single out five. Two were",
  "enabledbythenewtechnology:thesimultaneousprintingofmultipleeditions",
  "of the same paper in towns far distant from one other and the enhancement",
  "of print quality and, especially, of the production of pictures and other visual",
  "material. Other innovations were a product of changes in society and politics:",
  "the end of censorship facilitated the rise of investigative journalism, of hard-",
  "hitting stories on crime and political corruption. The spread of education and",
  "the expansion of the middle class gave an enormous fillip to Indian-language",
  "journalism. A national readership survey, conducted in 1979 and restricted to",
  "the towns and cities, estimated that as many as 48 million urban Indians reg-",
  "ularly read a periodical of some kind. The fastest increase was in the smaller",
  "townsandamongIndianlanguages.In1979,forthefirsttime,thosewhoread",
  "newspapers in Hindi (a language spoken by 40 per cent of Indians) numbered",
  "more than those who read them in English (a language spoken by a mere 3",
  "percent of Indians). The new journalism substituted a colloquial and demotic",
  "proseforthestiff,formalstyleoncepreferredbyeditorsandreporters.Idioms",
  "and phrases derived from the classical Sanskrit, once de rigueur, were now",
  "abandoned in favour of the rhythms and cadences of everyday speech.59",

  "for profit. On the other hand there were new forms of social assertion among",

  "workers.Therewasnow,forthefirsttime,anactive civilliberties movement.",
  "The press, which during the emergency had mostly been cowed without a",
  "fight, had become livelier than ever before.",
