  "I 1954 B economist named A. D. Shroff began a Forum of Free En-",
  "N A OMBAY",
  "terprise, whose ideas on economic development were somewhat at odds with",
  "those then influentially articulated by the Planning Commission of the gov-",
  "ernment of India. Shroff complained against the \u2018indifference, if not discour-",
  "agement\u2019 with which the state treated entrepreneurs. He believed that \u2019if the",
  "GovernmentofIndiashedsomeoftheirimpracticalideologiesandextendtheir",
  "active support to the private sector, very rapid industrialisation can be brought",
  "about with in the next 10 years\u2019.1",
  "At the same time as Shroff, but independently of him, a journalist named",
  "Philip Spratt was writing a series of essays in favour of free enterprise. Spratt",
  "was a Cambridge communist who was sent by his party in the 1920s to foment",
  "revolution in the subcontinent. Detected in the act, he spent many years in",
  "an Indian jail. The books he read in prison, and his marriage to an Indian",
  "woman afterwards, inspired a steady move rightwards. By the 1950s he was",
  "editing a pro-American weekly from Bangalore called MysIndia. There he in-",
  "veighed against the economic policies of the government of India. These, he",
  "said, treated the entrepreneur \u2018as a criminal who has dared to use his brains",
  "independently of the state to create wealth and give employment\u2019. The state\u2019s",
  "chief planner, P. C. Mahalanobis, had surrounded himself with Western leftists",
  "andSovietacademicians,whoreinforcedhisbeliefin\u2018rigidcontrolbythegov-",
  "ernment over all activities\u2019. The result, said Spratt, would be \u2018the smothering",
  "of free enterprise, a famine of consumer goods, and the tying down of millionsof workers to . . . soul-deadening techniques\u2019. His own preference was for a",
  "planthatwouldcreate\u2018thepsychologicalandeconomicconditionsneededfor",
  "a forward march by private enterprise\u2019.2",
  "The voices of men like Spratt and Shroff were drowned in the chorus",
  "of popular support for a model of heavy industrialization funded and directed",
  "by the government. The 1950s were certainly not propitious times for free-",
  "marketeers in India. But from time to time their ideas were revived. After",
  "the rupee was devalued in 1966 there were some moves towards freeing the",
  "trade regime, and hopes that the licensing system would also be liberalized.3",
  "However, after Indira Gandhi split the Congress Party in 1969, her govern-",
  "menttookits\u2018leftturn\u2019,nationalizingafreshrangeofindustriesandreturning",
  "to economic autarky. Then, in the late 1970s, the socialists in the Janata re-",
  "gime spectacularly affirmed India\u2019s economic independence by expelling for-",
  "eign firms such as IBM and Coca-Cola.",
  "In 1980 Mrs Gandhi returned to power. The next year, the head of the",
  "Tata Group of Companies gave along interview to a leading newspaper. J.",
  "R. D. Tata said here that \u2018the performance of the Indian economy from the",
  "mid-fiftiestothemid-sixtiesreflectedthesoundnessofthemixedeconomyas",
  "originally conceived\u2019. Industrial production grew at a handsome 8 per cent a",

  "II",
  "In the 1980s the government of India did lose some of its antipathy towards",
  "business. Greater encouragement was given to private enterprise, with keysectors being delicensed. These were \u2018pro-business\u2019 policies that enabled",
  "Indian industry to become more productive and profitable. However, they",
  "stopped short of being \u2018pro-market\u2019 policies that removed impediments to",
  "entry and exit by Indian or foreign firms, thus encouraging competition and",

  "he saw fit.",
  "Beforehebecameapublicservant,ManmohanSinghhadwrittenanOx-",
  "ford DPhil thesis suggesting that India move towards a more open trade re-",
  "gime. His thesis was written in the 1960s; now, three decades later, he seized",
  "the chance to put its recommendations into practice. The rupee was deval-",
  "ued, quotas removed forimports, tariffsreduced, exports encouraged and for-",
  "eign direct investment welcomed in. The domestic market was also freed; the",
  "\u2018licence-permit-quota-raj\u2019 was substantially done away with, and the public",
  "sector discouraged from expanding. Finally, the reforms sought to curb the",
  "profligacy of the government. Measures were introduced to reduce the fisc-",
  "al deficit, which was running at an alarming 8 per cent of gross domestic",
  "product.6",
  "Anewindustrialpolicy,framedinJuly1991,madeitclearthat\u2018industri-",
  "al licensing will henceforth be abolished for all industries, except those spe-",
  "cified, irrespective of levels of investment\u2019. The exceptions were industries",
  "critical to the country\u2019s defence, and industries hazardous to the environment",
  "and to human health, such as cigarette and alcohol manufacture. This was a",
  "dramatic reversal of the existing policy, which had reserved many industries",
  "to the state, and many others to the small-scale sector.7Therewasalsoaliberalizationoftheservicessector,withprivateplayers",
  "beingencouragedtoinvestininsurance,banking,telecommunications andair",
  "travel \u2013 sectors previously under more or less complete state control. Some",
  "economists thought that the reforms did not go far enough, noting, for in-",
  "stance, that the labour laws remained rigid (making it almost impossible for",
  "managers to fire workers) and that, while barriers to entry had been removed,",
  "barrierstoexitremained(thus,entrepreneursstillneededgovernmentpermis-",
  "sion to close unprofitable units). The bureaucratic regime had been under-",
  "mined but not completely dismantled. It still took weeks or months to start a",
  "business in India, whereas in China or Malaysia it took a matter of days.8",
  "Nonetheless, the changes introduced under the new regime constituted",
  "a major departure from past policies. Even a year or two before they were",
  "undertaken, such reforms were considered unlikely or even impossible. In a",
  "book published in 1989, a professor at the Harvard Business School identi-",
  "fied the vested interests that kept the command economy going \u2013 which in-",
  "cluded politicians, bureaucrats and indigenous entrepreneurs. The apparently",
  "permanent hold of this alliance of interests, wrote the Harvard professor, had",
  "\u2018served to diminish prospects for fundamental reforms of the nation\u2019s eco-",
  "nomic policies\u2019. In countries such as South Korea, the discipline of the mar-",

  "Naturally, the growth has been uneven, with some parts of the economy",
  "doing better than others. The most significant expansion has been in the ser-",
  "vices sector, which grew at an average of 8.1 per cent a year through the",
  "1990s. Much of this was contributed by the software industry, whose reven-",

  "Intheyear2000therewere340,000softwareprofessionalsinIndia,with",
  "some 50,000 fresh engineering graduates being recruited annually. About 20",
  "per cent of these professionals were women. In the first years of the new",
  "century the industry grew at an even faster rate. By 2004 it was employing",
  "600,000 people, and exporting $13 billion worth of services.",

  "mostly for foreign clients, who include many of the Fortune 500 companies.",
  "Some of this work is routine \u2013 maintaining accounts and employee records,",
  "for example. Other work is more innovative, such as designing new software",

  "However, with the development of satellite communications and the Internet,",
  "and the increasing sophistication of the work being done, the emphasis has",
  "shifted to \u2018outsourcing\u2019, to the codes being written within India and then sent",
  "back overseas.Software firms such as Wipro, TCS and Infosys are now household",
  "names in India. But they are also known and widely respected in business",
  "circles abroad. They are listed on the New York Stock Exchange, and own",
  "and operate subsidiary companies in many parts of the world. But there are",
  "also many small- and medium-sized companies in the business, and the mar-",
  "ket share of the largest firms has steadily declined over the last decade.10",
  "The software enterprises are clustered round a few major cities: Delhi,",
  "Madras, Hyderabad and, above all, Bangalore, which has acquired the sobri-",

  "cosmopolitan culture, one understands why it has emerged as such an attract-",
  "iveinvestmentdestination.WiproandInfosysarebothheadquarteredhere,as",
  "are several other important players in the software industry.",
  "To explain the rise of the software sector one must invoke factors both",
  "proximate and distant. Success, said John F. Kennedy, has many fathers. In",
  "this particular case, however, all the claimants have truth on their side. Some",
  "credit is certainly due to the reforms of 1991, which opened up the foreign",
  "marketforthefirsttime.ButsomecreditmustalsobetakenbyRajivGandhi\u2019s",
  "government, which gave special emphasis to the then very nascent electron-",
  "ics and telecommunications industries. Moving back a decade further, the",
  "Janata government\u2019s expulsion of IBM allowed the development of an indi-",
  "genous computer manufacturing and maintenance industry. But perhaps the",
  "story should really begin with jaw a harlal Nehru\u2019s government, which had",
  "the foresight to set up a chain of high-quality engineering schools, and the",
  "wisdom to retain English as the language of higher education and of interest",
  "and intranational communication. For, as one respected analyst of the IT sec-",
  "tor comments, \u2018India\u2019s greatest asset is a large, educated, English-speaking",

  "ciousirony:thatthisshowpieceofmarketliberalizationwasmadepossibleby",
  "a man committed to a state-sponsored path of economic development.",
  "In addition to these other factors, a geographical accident has also con-",
  "tributed enormously to the boom \u2013 the fact that India is on the other side of",
  "the globe from the United States, so that work done in the Indian day is ready",

  "and who work harder than their American counterparts at one-tenth the cost.",
  "In 2002 there were more than 300 call centres in India, employing 110,000",
  "people. The industry was growing at a staggering 71 per cent per year. It was",
  "estimated that by 2008 it would employ 2 million people, and generate $25",
  "billion dollars annually, amounting to as much as 3 per cent of India\u2019s GDP.12",

  "prayer requests to their Indian counterparts. One can have a thanksgiving",
  "prayer said for Rs40 (roughly a dollar) in an Indian church, whereas in an",
  "American church it would cost five times that amount.13",
  "If less spectacularly, the reforms of the 1990s have also had an impact",
  "on the manufacturing sector. Increased competition and the entry of foreign",
  "firmshasledtogreaterproductivityandlowerprices,benefitingthedomestic",
  "consumer.Some Indian industries have seized onopportunities offered bythe",
  "openingofinternationalmarkets.Thus,topclothingbrandssuchasGap,Polo",

  "now exports some half-million motor vehicles a year, as well as many soph-",
  "isticated components used in vehicles assembled elsewhere (one out of every",
  "two American trucks uses an axle made by an Indian firm). Another growth",
  "area is pharmaceuticals. Medicines exported by Indian companies were val-",
  "ued at $1,000 million in 2003 \u2013 these included drugs made according to mod-",
  "ern pharmacopoeia as well as those following the indigenous Ayurveda sys-",
  "tem.14",
  "The opening of the economy also led to many foreign firms coming in",
  "to tap the Indian market. Between 1991 and 2000 the government approved",
  "morethan10,000investmentproposalsbyforeigncompanies;ifallhadfructi-",
  "fied, they would be worth a staggering $20,000 million. They spanned the",

  "such as Azim Premji of the software giant WIPRO.17",
  "Meanwhile, the surge in economic growth has led to an expansion in the",
  "size and influence of the Indian middle class. The emergence of this stratum,",
  "writes the political scientist E. Sridharan, \u2018has changed India\u2019s class structure",
  "from one characterized by a sharp contrast between a small elite and a large",
  "impoverished mass, to one with a substantial intermediate class\u2019. How sub-",

  "most broadly, to include all households with an annual income in excess of",

  "than Rs140,000 a year, it consists of only 55 million Indians.18",
  "This new middle class is the prime target of the new products and ser-",

  "In the early years of Independence an ethic of Gandhian austerity hung",
  "heavily overthe Indian middle class. Inapoorcountry,onewasnotsupposed",
  "to have much wealth, and certainly not supposed to display it. Even those",
  "inclined towards hedonism were stalled by the absence of choice. With the",
  "opening of the economy in the 1990s, the guilt formerly associated with con-",
  "sumerism has rapidly disappeared. Whether it be cigarettes, cars, whisky or",

  "them.19",
  "Although most characteristic of the big cities, the new consumption is",
  "not restricted to them. A recent ethnography of rural Kerala speaks of how",
  "consumers in this age of liberalization exercise their choices with care and",
  "discrimination, with one eye on their pocket and the other on their neigh-",
  "bour. Rural Kerala, of course, is anything but characteristic of rural India as",
  "a whole. For one thing, the villages blend seamlessly into the towns; for an-",
  "other,manyvillagershavespenttimeworkingintheMiddleEast,makingthe",
  "kind of money that takes them straight into the middle class. Anyhow, among",
  "these new consumers,",
  "styles and tastes are hierarchically arranged, brand-names acting as",
  "markers of distinction: a Keltron (Kerala Electronics; a state enterprise)",
  "television confers less prestige than an Onida, Indian made, which, in",
  "turn, is not as good as a Sony made under licence in India, with max-",
  "imum prestige attached to foreign-made, imported televisions . . . Some-",
  "times people leave their labels on consumer durables to emphasise their",
  "origins.20",
  "As with televisions, so too with a whole range of products from facial creams",
  "to cars \u2013 the Indian consumer is now spoiled for choice. Once, the only auto-",

  "but now millions of Indians invest in property and the stock market.",

  "V",
  "A second consequence of the recent economic growth has been a decline in",
  "the percentage of Indians who live below the official poverty line. There is",
  "a vigorous scholarly debate on precisely how many poor people there are in",
  "India. Some statisticians have concluded that a mere 15 per cent live below",
  "the poverty line, while the more pessimistic estimates put the figure as high",
  "as 35 per cent. The government of India\u2019s own estimate lies in between these",
  "two extremes \u2013 at 26 per cent. While the precise numbers are in dispute, vir-",
  "tually all scholars accept that in both absolute and relative terms poverty has",
  "declined in the 1990s. At the beginning of the decade close to 40 per cent of",
  "Indianswere\u2018poor\u2019;bytheendofitthefigurehaddroppedbytenpercentage",
  "points or more.21",
  "Still, there are huge numbers of poor people in India \u2013 close to 300 mil-",
  "lion, if one sticks to the official estimate. Many of them are located in the",
  "cities. For beyond the glitzy malls and spanking new office buildings lie the",
  "slums and shanty towns where the majority of urban residents live. These are",
  "the people who service the middle class yet will never be part of it. They",
  "\u2018sell newspapers they will never read, sew clothes they cannot wear, polish",
  "carstheywillneverownandconstructbuildingswheretheywillneverlive\u2019.22",
  "Other slum dwellers labour long hours at low wages, in jobs perilous to their",
  "health,suchascuttingmetalandseparatingchemicals.Theyareusuallyunor-",
  "ganized, liable to be laid off without notice, and without insurance or pension",
  "benefits. 23",
  "The majority of the poor people in India, however, live in the villages.",
  "For the fruits of economic liberalization have scarcely percolated into the",
  "countryside. Agricultural growth was painfully slow during the 1990s. Thereweresomeattemptsatthediversification ofcrops,atgrowingfruitandveget-",
  "ables for the domestic market, and flowers for export. Yet these moves were",
  "limited in their success, largely because of deficiencies in infrastructure, i.e.",
  "thelackofelectricitytoprocesscropsorkeeptheminstorage,andthelackof",
  "roads to take them to the market.24",
  "Even when it came to that basic resource, food, the picture was less",
  "cheering than it might have been. Taking the country as a whole, there was",
  "a modest food surplus. \u2018Buffer stocks\u2019 of several million tones were being",
  "maintainedingovernmentgodowns.Yetthedistributionmechanismsinplace",
  "were seriously inadequate; in times of scarcity, stocks did not move quickly",
  "enough to communities that needed them. The targeting was inefficient; grain",
  "from the Public Distribution System (PDS) more easily reached urban areas",
  "than rural ones, and rich states than poor ones. And there was terrific corrup-",
  "tion; according to one estimate, only 20 per cent of the grain released through",
  "the PDS actually reached the intended recipients, the rest being sold on the",
  "blackmarket.Hungerandmalnutritionremainedendemicinmanyparts,with",
  "starvation deaths reported when the rains failed.25",
  "Through much of the country, life and livelihood remained dependent",
  "on the availability of water. Sixty years after independence, a mere 40 per",
  "cent of cultivated area was under irrigation. For most farmers, the uncertain-",
  "tiescausedbytheyear-to-yearfluctuationinrainfallwerecompoundedbythe",
  "pre-emption of perennial water sources by the cities. Delhi took its supplies",

  "In the last years of the twentieth century the first farmers\u2019 suicides were",
  "reported. This was a disturbingly novel phenomenon, for while hunger and",
  "poverty had been a feature of the subcontinental landscape for centuries, nev-",
  "er before had so many rural people gone so far as to take their own lives.",
  "Suicide, as the pioneering studies of the French sociologist Emile Durkheim",

  "cities dislocated from the protective care of the family and community; andit also, as it happened, increased in late-twentieth-century Bangalore, among",
  "young software professionals stressed out by the long hours of work or the",
  "rapid success of their colleagues.",
  "Indian anthropologists had previously reported high rates of suicide",
  "among some isolated mountain tribes.27 But what was now happening among",
  "settled peasant communities was unprecedented. Between 1995 and 2005",
  "there were at least 10,000 suicides by farmers, these occurring in states as far",
  "apart as Andhra Pradesh and Rajasthan. Usually it was the male head of the",
  "household who killed himself, most often by swallowing pesticides, at other",
  "timesbyhangingorelectrocution.Inmanycaseshetookthisextremestepbe-",

  "operatives or private moneylenders. But indebtedness had also been a pervas-",
  "ive feature of rural life; why, now, did it lead so often to this tragic outcome?",
  "No systematic studies yet exist to answer this question, but some preliminary",
  "speculation might be in order. Pace Durkheim, the rash of farmers\u2019 suicides",
  "is perhaps related to the rapidity of social change in contemporary India. The",
  "new consumer society, its images carried into the villages by television, does",
  "place a very high premium on success and failure. Thus, when crops fail, or",
  "a new crop does not give the yield it promised, the personal humiliation felt",
  "is greatly in excess of what it might have been in an earlier, more stable, and",
  "less acquisitive time.28",
  "VI",
  "One reason for the continuing poverty is the government\u2019s poor record in",
  "providing basic services such as education and health care. In 1991, the year",
  "the reforms began, only 39 per cent of Indian women could read and write",
  "and only 64 per cent of men. Here, India lagged behind not merely the deve-",
  "loped nations of the West, but also some of its Asian neighbours: Sri Lanka",
  "had educated 89 per cent of its women and 94 per cent of its men, while the",
  "corresponding figures for China were 75 and 96 per cent.",
  "The inability \u2013 some would say unwillingness \u2013 to educate all or even",
  "most of its citizens counted as independent India\u2019s greatestfailure.29 In the",
  "1990s,however,thegovernmentinitiatedanumberofschemestouniversalize",
  "education. First, there was the District Primary Education Programme, which",
  "focused on 250 districts where female literacy was less than the national av-",
  "erage. A little later this was superseded by a Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (Pro-gramme to Educate All). The funds devoted to primary education from the",
  "publicexchequerwereincreased,andtherewasalsoaninflowofmoneyfrom",
  "foreign donors.",
  "The government was pushed to be more proactive by an order of the Su-",
  "preme Court directing all state governments to provide cooked midday meals",
  "in schools. Many children who entered primary school dropped out well be-",
  "fore they got to secondary education. A high proportion of these drop-outs",
  "were girls withdrawn by their families to help with household tasks such",
  "as cooking, cleaning and collecting firewood. In Tamil Nadu, where midday",
  "meals had first been introduced, they had helped considerably in increasing",
  "enrolment. It was hoped that a country wide extension would encourage par-",
  "ents to send their children to school and keep them there.30",
  "Anumberofinnovativenon-governmentalorganizationsalsoenteredthe",
  "educational field in the 1990s. One NGO, active in the poorer districts of",
  "Andhra Pradesh, was able to place every child from 400 villages in school.",
  "The NGO ran a \u2018bridge course\u2019 for those who entered school late (most of",
  "whom were girls) \u2013 giving them six months of intensive coaching before pla-",
  "cing them in the regular curriculum. Another NGO was following similar",
  "methods among the slum dwellers of India\u2019s largest city, Mumbai. They had",
  "opened 3,000 balwadis (playschools), where children between the ages of 3",
  "and 5 were taught to read and write. In these densely crowded slums, with",
  "spaceatapremium,allkindsofsiteswereutilized\u2013templecourtyards,school",
  "verandahs, public parks, even offices of political parties. From the balwadis",
  "these children were sent on to regular municipal schools. By 1998, some",
  "55,000childrenhadpassedthroughthisprocess,whichwasbythenbeingex-",
  "tended to other cities and towns of northern and western India.31",
  "Within the state system there was considerable variation in implement-",
  "ation and effectiveness. Schools in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh were very badly",
  "run,withpoorornon-existent facilities \u2013noblackboards, nochairs, notoilets",
  "for girls. The teachers were uncommitted \u2013 rates of absenteeism were high",
  "\u2013 and the parents apathetic. Among the better-performing states were Kerala",
  "and Tamil Nadu in the south and Himachal Pradesh in the north. The edu-",
  "cational progress of this last state was both rapid and unexpected. Himachal",
  "was dominated by the Rajputs, a caste who had traditionally kept their wo-",
  "men at home. It was also a hilly state, with widely dispersed hamlets, making",
  "schools hard to site and harder to get to. However, these natural and cultural",
  "disadvantages were overcome by the state\u2019s administration, led by its dynam-",
  "icchiefministerDrY.S.Parmar.AfterHimachalwascarvedoutofPunjabin",
  "the late 1960s, Parmar made elementary education a pivotal element of pub-lic policy. Public expenditure on education was twice the national average,",
  "while the teacher-child ratio was far higher than in other parts of India. Par-",
  "ents were quick to realize the benefits of sending both their boys and girls to",
  "school. Concerned families and capable administrators worked to ensure that",
  "the schools were well maintained, and teachers properly motivated. The res-",
  "ultswereimpressive:while,in1961,only11percentofgirlsinthesehilldis-",
  "tricts were literate, by 1998 the figure had jumped to 98 per cent.32",
  "Although no other state performed nearly as well as Himachal Pradesh,",
  "the data suggested that the education sector was not as somnolent as it had",
  "once been. By the end of the 1990s the national literacy rate had risen from",
  "39 to 54 per cent for females and from 64 to 76 per cent for males. Behind",
  "these changes in quantity lay a fundamental change in mentality. Once, many",
  "poorparentshadchosentoputtheirchildrentoworkratherthansendthemto",
  "school. Now they wished to place them in a position from which they could,",
  "withluckandenterprise,exchangealifeofmeniallabourforajobinthemod-",
  "ern economy. As the educationist Vimala Ramachandran wrote in 2004, \u2018the",
  "demand side had never looked more promising. The overwhelming eviden-",
  "ce emanating from studies done in the last 10 years clearly demonstrates that",
  "there is a tremendous demand for education \u2013 across the board and among",
  "all social groups. Wherever the government has ensured a well-functioning",
  "school within reach, enrolment has been high.\u201933",
  "Where developments in education called for a cautious optimism, the",
  "outlook in the health sector remained bleak. Hospitals owned and run by",
  "the central and state governments were in a pathetic state: crowded, corrupt,",
  "withoutbasicfacilitiesorqualifieddoctors.Andthepoliticalclassseemedun-",
  "concerned. In fact, public expenditure on health was on the decline: in 1990",
  "it constituted 1.3 per cent of GDP, by 1999 the figure had dropped to 0.9 per",
  "cent. At the same time there was a tremendous expansion of privatized health",
  "care which, by 2002, accounted for nearly 80 per cent of all health expendit-",
  "ure.This, however,was aimed at servicing the growingmiddle class. Insome",
  "areas the poor were served by committed NGOs, but for the most part they",
  "were left to their own devices, going to local medicine men or village quacks",
  "to treat their illnesses.",
  "Some statistics may be in order here. Average life expectancy in 2001",

  "In Meghalaya, for example, it was 89 deaths per 1,000. India had 60 per cent",

  "were HIVpositive.34",
  "In the popular mind it is the continent of Africa that is most seriously",
  "threatened by the Aids virus. In an August 2005 cover story in the prestigious",
  "Financial Times weekend magazine, a British journalist wrote that this per-",

  "manity, that the global fight against Aids will be won or lost\u2019. There were",

  "restricted to Aids alone. In the more sober but not necessarily contradictory",

  "health and has paid a very heavy price for that\u2019.36",
  "VII",
  "Economic liberalization has improved the lives of many millions of Indians,",
  "but has left millions more untouched. And there are also some Indians who",
  "have been adversely affected by the freeing of the market and the opening of",

  "of Orissa are perhaps foremost. Orissa is divided into a coastal region, dom-",
  "inated by caste Hindus, and a series of mountain ranges in the interior, where",
  "live a variety of adivasi communities. In the state as a whole the Hindus are",
  "in a majority, and they wield most of the political and administrative power.",

  "The wealth in these highlands is mostly under the ground. Orissa has 70",
  "percentofthecountry\u2019sbauxitereserves,andalsosubstantialdepositsofiron",

  "Koraput. In the past, these ores were worked by Indian public sector compan-",
  "ies,butinthelastdecadetheyhavebeensupplantedbyprivatefirms,domest-",
  "ic as well as foreign. The state government has signed a series ofleases offer-",
  "ing land at attractive prices to companies who wish to mine these hills.38",
  "One of the more ambitious projects was floated in 1992 by a consortium",
  "named Utkal Alumina, which brought together Canadian and Norwegian",
  "firms with the Aditya Birla Group. This had its eye on the Baphlimali hills of",
  "theKashipurblockofRayagadadistrict,underwhichlayadepositof200mil-",
  "lion tones of bauxite. The proposal was to mine this ore and transport it to a",
  "newly built refinery, which would process the material and export the refined",
  "product.",
  "Some of the land to be used for these operations was owned by the gov-",
  "ernment, but some 3,000 acres were cultivated by tribals. These saw no bene-",
  "fit in the project, which would dispossess them of their fields and give them",
  "naught in return. In 1993 a delegation of tribal activists met the chief minis-",
  "ter and demanded that he cancel the lease. Their request was refused; instead,",
  "the government sent a team to survey the land preparatory to its acquisition.",
  "Over the next few years the tribals tried a variety of strategies to stop the pro-",
  "ject from getting off the ground. Employees of Utkal Alumina were prohib-",
  "ited from entering the villages. Roads were blockaded and marches organized",
  "toraise consciousness oftheenvironmental damage that mining wouldcause.",
  "When the company constructed a \u2018model\u2019 of the kind of house in which they",

  "was given to the likely environmental and social consequences.43 As these",
  "projects began to take shape they too encountered popular resistance. To al-",
  "low Tata Steel to build a factory processing iron ore for the Chinese market,",
  "the government acquired land in Kalinganagar at much less than the market",
  "rate. The protests of the local villagers were overruled, the land handed over",
  "and construction work commenced. In the first week of 2006 a group of tri-",
  "bals demolished the boundary wall, provoking the police to open fire. Twelve",
  "people died in the incident. The tribals placed the bodies of these martyrs on",
  "the highway and held up traffic for a week. Among the first to express solid-",

  "Of course, even before 1991 India was a land marked by sharp inequal-",
  "ities. Some regions and some social groups were noticeably less poor than",
  "others.However,themarket-orientedreformshavetendedtoaccentuatethese",
  "inequalities. The states that were poorest grew most slowly during the dec-",
  "ade, while the states that were already better off grew faster. Throughout the",

  "3.58percentandOrissa3.25percent.Ontheotherside,Gujarathadagrowth",
  "rateof9.57percent,Maharashtra8.01percentandTamilNadu6.22percent.",
  "Broadly speaking, the states that did well were located in the south and west",
  "of the country while the states that fared indifferently were in the north and",
  "east. At the very bottom were the massively populous states of Bihar and Ut-",
  "tar Pradesh. In 1993, these two states accounted for 41.7 per cent of India\u2019s",
  "poor, in 2000, for 42.5 per cent.45",
  "Itappearedthateconomicperformancewascruciallydependentoninitial",
  "endowments of human capital and physical infrastructure. The states that had",
  "better schools and hospitals and hence amore skilled and healthy workforce",
  "were usually also the states that had better roads, more reliable electricity and",
  "less corrupt administrations.46 Naturally it was to these locations that invest-",
  "ment and investors gravitated. In a pre-reform era, the central government of-",

  "surged further ahead as a consequence.",
  "That said, in even the most prosperous states it was not the entire pop-",
  "ulation that benefited. The capitals of Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh, Ban-",
  "galore and Hyderabad respectively, were at the leading edge of the software",
  "boom, but their own hinterlands had been left far behind. Between 1994 and2000 per capita consumption expenditure grew in rural Karnataka at 9.5 per",
  "cent annually, in urban Karnataka at 26.5 per cent. The corresponding figures",
  "for Andhra Pradesh were 2.8 and 18.5 per cent. Taking India as a whole, ex-",
  "penditure grew at 8.7 per cent per year in the countryside, but at 16.6 per cent",
  "in the cities.47",
  "AstheeconomistT.N.Srinivasanobserves,thesewidedisparitiesmeant",
  "that",
  "if one is poor in India . . . one is more likely to live in rural areas, more",

  "\u2018The Rise of India\u2019. It noted that there were now more IT engineers in Ban-",
