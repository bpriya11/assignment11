  "VEN BY THE STANDARDS",
  "The first week of June witnessed Operation Bluestar, an unprecedented attack",
  "by the state on a place of worship. The last day of October saw the assassin-",
  "ation of Indira Gandhi, the first major political killing since that of Mahatma",
  "Gandhi. That murder had temporarily brought a halt to Hindu-Muslim violen-",
  "ce; this one provoked a wave of violence by Hindus on Sikhs.",
  "It was against this bloody backdrop that Rajiv Gandhi was sworn in as",
  "prime minister. A month after he took office, the country witnessed a tragedy",
  "that claimed as many lives as had the anti-Sikh riots. In the early hours of 3",
  "December 1984 white smoke began filling the air of the central Indian city of",
  "Bhopal. Citizens asleep in their homes were woken up with fits of coughing,",
  "vomiting and a burning sensation in the eyes. In panic they got out of bed and",
  "wentoutintothestreet,thegascloudfollowingthem.Bydawn,\u2018themainthor-",

  "ground tanks, it was usually rendered harmless by a scrubber before being re-",
  "leased into the atmosphere. However, on this night an unanticipated chemical",
  "reaction led to the release of MIC in its toxic state. The effects were devastat-",
  "ing. Within hours of the leak, at least 400 people had died of exposure to the",
  "gas. The final tally was in excess of 2,000, making it the worst industrial ac-",
  "cident in human history. The bulk of the victims lived in the slums and shantytowns which ringed the factory. Apart from those who died, another 50,000",

  "In the wake of the tragedy came a wave of visitors to Bhopal, not all of",

  "be filed in an American court of law. The CEO of Union Carbide came, was",
  "briefly arrested, then released on bail and flown back to New York. Ten days",
  "after the accident a team of Indian scientists came to neutralize the stocks of",
  "MIC that still lay in the Carbide factory. The project was named Operation",
  "Faith, but it inspired only distrust. Fearing a fresh leak, thousands of resid-",
  "ents made to leave Bhopal, with \u2018the city bus terminal and the railway station",

  "the MIC was being stored at temperatures higher than recom-mended.3 What",
  "was clear was that a potentially hazardous industry had no business to be in",
  "the city. Before the plant went into production in 1980, the town planner M.",
  "N. Buch recommended that Union Carbide choose a safer and less populated",
  "location. Indeed, as a report of June 1984 revealed, the history of the plant",

  "II",
  "The accident in Bhopal occurred in the first week of December. At the end of",
  "the month, India witnessed its eighth general election. The polls were dom-",
  "inated by the murder and memory of Indira Gandhi. The Congress campaign,",
  "overseen by the advertising agency Rediffusion, presented Rajiv Gandhi as",
  "thelogical heirtohismother\u2019slegacy,andthepartyitselfastheonlybulwark",
  "against the forces of secession. \u2018India could be your vote away from unity",
  "or separation\u2019, ran the punchline of one ad featuring Rajiv. \u2018Will the cast of",
  "\u201977 ever be united by a common ideology instead of a common greed for",
  "power?\u2019 ran another.5 The Congress campaign, wrote one commentator, cap-",
  "italized on the growing mass insecurities\u2019, whereby \u2018Mrs Gandhi\u2019s assassin-ation was equated in the public mind withan assault on the Indian State and",
  "that perception was constantly reinforced.\u20196",
  "When the results came in, the Congress had swept the polls, capturing",
  "almost 50 per cent of the popular vote and almost 80 per cent of the seats in",
  "Parliament. Under the leadership of apolitical novice, the Congress won 401",
  "seats,farmorethantheyeverhadunderNehruorIndiraGandhi.However,as",

  "The general election had been won by stoking the fear of secession: but",
  "now,withacomfortablemajorityinhand,theprimeministermovedswiftlyto",
  "makepeaceinthePunjab.TheleadersoftheAkaliDalwereletoutofjailand",
  "emissaries sent to talk to them. Sant Harcharan Singh Longowal seemed as",
  "keen as Rajiv Gandhi to put the past behind him. InJuly 1985the two leaders",
  "signedanaccord,agreeingtotransferChandigarhtoPunjabwithinaspecified",
  "time frame, assuring Punjab a fair share of river waters and committing the",
  "government to a fresh review of centre\u2013state relations in general. President\u2019s",
  "Rule was to be revoked and state elections held.",
  "Following the agreement, Sant Longowal toured the Punjab, speaking at",
  "public meetings and preaching in gurdwaras. Everywhere he asked that the",
  "people support the moves for reconciliation. While addressing a congregation",
  "inSangrur,Longowalwasshotdeadbytwoyoungmen,whoheldhimtohave",
  "betrayed the Sikh cause by breaking bread with the rulers in New Delhi. The",
  "incident occurred on 20 August; bravely, the government chose to go ahead",
  "withassemblyelectionsinlateSeptember.TheSant\u2019sdeathcreatedawaveof",
  "popular support for his party. The Akali Dal won a comfortable majority, for",
  "thefirsttimeintheprovince\u2019shistory.Withtwo-thirdsoftheadultpopulation",
  "casting their ballots, the polls were interpreted as a vote against extremism.8",
  "Meanwhile,attheotherendofthecountry,thegovernmentalsoclinched",
  "an agreement with the All-Assam Students Union. The two sides agreed on",
  "cut-off dates for \u2018infiltrators\u2019: those who had arrived after 1 January 1966 but",
  "before 25 March 1971 (when the civil war in East Pakistan began)would be",
  "allowed to stay but not vote, while those who came later would be identified",
  "and deported. Here too President\u2019s Rule was ended and elections called. A",
  "student\u2019s union transformed itself into apolitical party, with AASU members",
  "creating the Asom Gana Parishad (AGP). When polls to the state assembly",
  "were held in December 1985 the AGP trounced the once-dominant Congress.",
  "The new chief minister, Prafulla Mahanta, was only thirty-two years of age;",
  "manyofhislegislatorswereevenyounger.AsinPunjab,theresultwashailed",
  "as a vindication of democracy. Senior Congress figures in Delhi argued that,whiletheirpartyhadlost,theRepublicofIndiahadwon.\u2018Menwhoweredis-",
  "tributing dynamite earlier were handling poll posters,\u2019 remarked one Union",
  "Minister: From a nationalistic point of view is that victory or defeat?\u20199",
  "In June 1986 the government of India signed a peace agreement with",
  "Laldenga, leader of the Mizo National Front. By its terms, the MNF rebels",
  "laid down their arms and were granted an amnesty against prosecution. The",
  "government agreed to grant full statehood to Mizoram, and Laldenga himself",
  "assumed office as chief minister, taking over from the Congress incumbent.",
  "The model here was the Kashmir agreement of 1975, when Sheikh Abdullah",
  "had returned to power in a similar fashion.10",
  "One journal remarked that Rajiv Gandhi \u2018had brought to the Mizos the",
  "goodwill of the nation\u2019; as he had previously done to the Sikhs and the As-",
  "samese.11 Although these agreements had actually been envisioned and draf-",
  "ted by officials \u2013 such as the veteran diplomat G. Parthasarathi \u2013 the credit",
  "accrued to the young prime minister, who was seen as standing above party",
  "rivalries intheinterests ofnational reconciliation. Inallthreecases,partiesor",
  "leaders opposed to the Congress had come to power through peaceful means.",

  "Arun Singh and Arun Nehru, two friends from the corporate sector who were",
  "made ministers. Like him, they were young and English speaking. Like him,",
  "they were at ease with modern technology. They made manifest their inten-",
  "tion to take India directly from the sixteenth century to the twenty-first, from",
  "the age of the bullock cart to the age of the personal computer. In some parts",
  "of the media the new recruits attracted derision or amusement, being known",
  "as \u2018Rajiv\u2019s computer boys\u2019. In other parts they attracted approbation; here,",
  "Rajiv Gandhi was compared to John F. Kennedy, who had likewise \u2018symbol-ised youth and the hope of a new generation\u2019, assembling a \u2018team of the best",
  "and the brightest\u2019 to carve a new future for his land.13",
  "In the first year of his term the prime minister was often on tour, making",
  "his acquaintance with parts of the country he had not previously seen. Rajiv",
  "Gandhi\u2019s \u2018Discovery of India\u2019 was appreciatively covered in the press, and",
  "on television. The 1980s had seen an enormous growth in the ownership of",
  "TV sets. With broadcasting still a state monopoly, the government channel,",
  "Doordarshan, shot and showed hundreds of hours featuring the young and",
  "handsome prime minister in the field: on a houseboat in Kashmir, in a remote",
  "tribal hamlet, among coconut trees in Kerala. Everywhere, he met ordinary",
  "Indians and received their petitions, passing them on to the district adminis-",
  "tration for action.14",
  "The first crisis of the new regime was, in fact, caused by a petition. It",
  "had, however, been submitted not to the prime minister but to the Supreme",
  "Court of India. The petitioner was an elderly man named Mohammed Ahmed",
  "Khan, who wished to appeal against a lower court\u2019s decision demanding that",
  "he pay monthly maintenance to his divorced wife, Shah Bano. Khan conten-",
  "ded that he had fulfilled his duties by paying Shah Bano an allowance for",
  "three months, the period specified (he claimed) under Islamic law. In reject-",
  "ing Khan\u2019s appeal, the Supreme Court invoked Section 125 of the Criminal",
  "Procedure Code, whereby a divorced woman was entitled to claim an allow-",
  "ance from her ex-husband if he had taken another wife (as Khan had), and if",
  "she had not remarried and could not otherwise maintain herself (as was the",
  "case with Shah Bano). Section 125, noted the Court, \u2018was enacted in order to",
  "provide a quick and summary remedy to a class of persons who are unable",
  "to maintain itself. What difference would it then make as to what is the reli-",
  "gion professed by the neglected wife, child or parent?\u2019 In their opinion, the",
  "explanationstotheCriminalProcedureCodeshowed\u2018unmistakably,thatSec-",
  "tion 125 overrides the personal law, if there is any conflict between the two\u2019.",
  "M. A. Khan had first filed the appeal in 1981; it took four years for the",
  "case to come to judgement. Dismissing the appeal on 23 April 1985, the Su-",
  "preme Court confirmed that Khan would have to continue to pay Shah Bano",
  "maintenanceasfixedbytheHighCourt(atthecuriousfigureofRs179.20per",
  "month). Then the judges went beyond the specifics of the case to make some",
  "general remarks. They deplored the fact that Article 44 of the constitution,",
  "mandating a uniform civil code, \u2018has remained a dead letter\u2019. They observed",
  "that\u2018abeliefseemstohavegainedgroundthatitisfortheMuslimcommunity",
  "to take a lead in the matter of reforms of their personal law. A common civilcode will help the cause of national integration by removing disparate loyal-",
  "ties to laws which have conflicting ideologies.\u201915",
  "In some circles these remarks were taken as a gratuitous chastisement of",
  "the minority community as a whole. Muslims took exception to the judges,",
  "saying that \u2018it is alleged that the \u201cfatal point in Islam is the degradation of",
  "women\u201d\u2019. (In fairness, they had also noted that the Hindu law-giver, Manu,",
  "believedthatthewomandoesnotdeserveindependence\u2019).Muslimclericscri-",
  "ticized the judgement as an attack on Islam. Mosques up and down the coun-",
  "try resounded with the voices of mullahs and maulvis denouncing Shah Bano",
  "and the Supreme Court judgement\u2019.16 On the other hand, some Muslim schol-",
  "ars supported the verdict, or at any rate held it to be not inconsistent with",
  "scripture, where there existed \u2018ample and respectable Islamic authority\u2019 for",
  "thepropositionthatthedivorcinghusbandmustprovidemaintenanceuntilhis",
  "ex-wife\u2019s death or remarriage.17",

  "Arif Mohammed Khan had the support of the prime minister; with the",
  "Congress voting against it, the bill was defeated. However, the debate carried",
  "on outside the House. In her native Indore, the 75-year-old Shah Bano was",
  "denounced by conservatives as an infidel; demonstrations were held outside",
  "her house and neighbours were asked to ostracize her. On 15 November Shah",

  "The judges, he added maliciously, were small men who were incompetent to",
  "interpret Islamic law\u2019.21",
  "By now, it was not merely Shah Bano who had succumbed to the pres-",
  "sure. The Congress itself had \u2018accorded recognition to fundamentalists as the",
  "sole spokesmen of their community\u2019.22 In February 1986 the government in-",
  "troduced a \u2018Muslim Women\u2019s Bill\u2019 in Parliament which sought to over turn",
  "theSupremeCourtverdict,bytakingMuslimpersonallawoutofthepurview",
  "of the Criminal Procedure Code. The bill placed the burden of supporting the",

  "The controversy sparked by the Shah Bano case was in many ways a re-",

  "tedbypriestsclaimingtospeakforthecommunityasawhole.Theclaimwas",
  "tested and found wanting, when Jawaharlal Nehru fought and won the 1952",
  "elections on, among other things, the issue of the Hindu Code Bill.",
  "Faced with a comparable situation in 1985\u20136, Rajiv Gandhi already had",
  "the support of 400 MPs. A reform of Muslim personal law to enhance the",
  "rights of women was comfortably within reach. So, even, was a gender-sens-",
  "itive common civil code (as asked for by the constitution). What was lacking",
  "was a prime minister consistently committed to social reform. For as a high",

  "it was claimed that the site was the birthplace of the Hindu deity Ram, and",
  "that before the mosque was built, it had been home to a temple devoted to his",
  "worship.",
  "There is no evidence that the hero of the epic Ramayan was a historical",
  "character, but Hindu sentiment and myth widely held that he was, and that he",
  "had been born in Ayodhya at the very spot where the mosque was later built.",
  "ThesitewasknownlocallyasRamJanmab-hoomi,literally,thepieceofearth",

  "rest of the year, the idol was kept locked away from worshippers.",
  "For three decades the status quo held until, in the early eighties, an or-",
  "ganization named the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (World Hindu Council) began",
  "campaigning for the \u2018liberation of the spot where Ram was born\u2019. The VHP",
  "brought under one banner hundreds of monks from the numerous old temples",
  "that dotted Ayodhya. Processions and public meetings were organized, where",
  "fiery speeches were made urging Hindus to free their god from \u2018a Muslim",
  "jail\u2019. A local lawyer then filed a suit seeking public worship of the Ram idol.",
  "It was in response to this appeal that the district judge ruled that the locks be",
  "opened, and worship allowed.25",
  "Thejudge\u2019sorderwaswidelybelievedtohavebeendirectedfromDelhi,",
  "from the Prime Minister\u2019s Office, no less. The local administration seemedto know of the judgement beforehand, for the locks were opened within an",
  "hour of the verdict. Remarkably, even the national TV channel was at hand to",
  "capture on camera the precise moment when devotees rushed into the newly",
  "opened shrine. There appeared to be a strong connection between the Muslim",
  "Women\u2019s Bill and the Ayodhya verdict. It was said that Rajiv Gandhi opened",
  "the locks on the advice of his colleague Arun Nehru, who thought the Con-",
  "gressnowneededtocompensatethechauvinistsontheotherside.Aleft-wing",
  "MP commented sarcastically that while the prime minister presented himself",
  "as a thoroughly modern man, striving to take India into the twenty-first cen-",
  "tury, in fact \u2018he has a mind as primitive as the mullahs and the pandits\u2019.26",
  "Or,asthepolitical analystNeerjaChowdhurywrote,\u2018MrRajivGandhiwants",
  "both to run with the hare and hunt with the hounds\u2019. If one act was aimed at",
  "the \u2018Muslim\u2019 vote, this other one seemed to target the far larger \u2018Hindu\u2019 vote.",
  "Chowdhury warned that \u2018a policy of appeasement of both communities being",
  "pursued by the government for electoral gains is a vicious cycle which will",
  "become difficult tobreak\u2019.27",
  "The opening of the locks emboldened the Vishwa Hindu Parishad. They",
  "now sought nothing less than the demolition of the mosque, and its replace-",
  "ment with a grand new temple dedicated to Ram. The VHP was working",
  "closelywiththeRashtriyaSwayamsevakSangh,theolderHinduorganization",
  "which was enjoying afresh lease of life. The RSS and VHP held meetings",
  "across India demanding that the \u2018majority\u2019 stand up for their rights. The",
  "Muslim Women\u2019s Bill was adduced as yet another example of the Congress",
  "governmentseekingtoplacatetheminority.OnlyHindus,itwasalleged,were",
  "asked to disown their faith in this mistakenly \u2018secular\u2019 state. A new slogan",
  "was coined and broadcast: Garv se kaho hum Hindu hain! (Say you are a",
  "Hindu, and say it with pride.)",
  "This message, as the weekly India Today wrote in May 1986, \u2018struck",
  "a high-strung emotional chord. Slowly but surely, like a juggernaut gaining",
  "angry momentum, a palpable, resurgent, united and increasingly militant",
  "movement of Hindu resurgence is sweeping across the land\u2019. Here was a",

  "VIt is possible to view the Hindu faith as a river with many tributaries, some",
  "that feed into a main stream and others that leave it. Perhaps the image itself",

  "the lesser holy men, the thousands of sants and sadhus who each had a mod-",
  "est following of their own. Beyond the building of a Ram temple in Ayodhya,",
  "these moves towards apan-Hindu unity had rich political possibilities. As one",
  "leading priest explained:",
  "There are dozens of dharmacharyas [in] Hindu society and each has a",
  "vote bank of approximately twenty-five lakhs (or 2.5 million). For ex-",
  "ample, there is Gujarat\u2019s sant Sri Murari Bapu, Rajasthan\u2019s Sri Ramsukh",
  "Dasji Maharaj, UP\u2019s sant Sri Devrah Baba, RSS\u2019s Sri Deorasji, Ayod-",

  "and get hinduized.29",
  "On the other side, the threats to the old mosque in Ayodhya had mobilized",
  "Muslim opinion in its defence. A Babri Masjid Action Committee was",
  "formed, which urged the state to prevent this and other Muslim shrines from",
  "being taken over by radical Hindus. In some sections of the community the",

  "The scarcities of 1985 and 1987 underlined the continuing dependence",
  "of the economy on the monsoon. Yet even in areas of irrigated agriculture",
  "there was discontent. This was stoked by two newly formed farmers\u2019 organ-",
  "izations: the Shetkari Sanghatana, active in Maharashtra; and the Bharatiya",
  "KisanUnion,basedinHaryanaandPunjab.Theformerwasledbyaone-time",
  "civil servant named Sharad Joshi, the latter by a Jat farmer named Mahindra",
  "Singh Tikait. According to Joshi, the main axis of conflict was between \u2018In-",

  "at\u2019,representedbythevillagers.Hearguedthateconomicpolicieshadconsist-",

  "use. Both their organizations commanded a large base; each could rustle up",
  "50,000 or more farmers to march on the state capital to press their demands.47Although Joshi and Tikait claimed to speak for the rural population as",
  "a whole, in truth they represented the middle and rich peasantry, those who",
  "used tractors and electrified pump-sets and had a surplus to sell in the mar-",
  "ket. The poor were mostly outside their purview. As studies conducted in the",
  "1980s once more confirmed, class strongly overlapped with caste in village",
  "India, where the truly disadvantaged continued to be the Harijans or Sched-",
  "uled Castes (SCs). A survey in Karnataka revealed that nearly 80 per cent",
  "of SCs living in the countryside, as well as more than 60 per cent of SCs in",
  "towns, were below the official poverty line, their monthly expenditure less",
  "than Rs50 a month. The picture was much the same in other parts of India.48",

  "worked within the democratic process and outside it, sometimes petitioning",
  "Union ministers, at other times engaging in pitched battles with the police.",
  "Through the latter half of 1986 the clashes were particularly intense. Eventu-",
  "ally, the prime minister met Ghisingh, persuading him to accept an autonom-",

  "A second set of conflicts pitted residents of individual states against",
  "the Union government. Thus in Punjab, the euphoria generated by the Rajiv",

  "provoke a fresh round of revenge killings against the Sikhs. Then the Sikhs",
  "who survived might come back to the Punjab, there to form a consolidated,",
  "unified, homogeneous community, the better to fight the battle for Khalistan.",
  "The model, apparently, was the successful struggle for Pakistan back in the",

  "Even as the Indian government was trying \u2013 with mixed success \u2013 to contain",

  "in its own way as mountainous Kashmir \u2013 was caught in a bloody civil war",

  "Of the several Tamil resistance organizations, the most influential and",

  "fighter named Velupillai Prabhakaran, the LTTE had as its aim a separate na-",
  "tion, to be constituted from the north and east of the island, where the Tamils",
  "were in a majority. Throughout the early 1980s they mounted raids on Sri",
  "Lankan army camps and committed atrocities on civilians. The Sinhala re-",
  "sponsewas,ifanything,evenmorefierce.Thiswas,inotherwords,aconflict",
  "of an almost unspeakable brutality and savagery.",
  "LTTE fighters had long used the Indian state of Tamil Nadu as a safe",
  "haven. Their activities were actively helped by the state government, with",
  "New Delhi turning an indulgent blind eye. However, in the summer of 1987",
  "Rajiv Gandhi was asked by the Sri Lankan President, J. R. Jayawardene, to",
  "help mediate in the conflict. Under an agreement signed between Colombo",
  "and New Delhi, an Indian Peace Keeping Force (IPKF) would be flown into",
  "the island. The Sri Lankan army would retreat to the barracks, and the LTTE",
  "militants persuaded \u2013 or forced \u2013 to disarm.In late July 1987 Indian troops began going to Sri Lanka in batches",
  "of a few thousand. (Eventually, as many as 48,000 soldiers of the Indian",

  "the Indians. They made particularly effective use of land mines, blowing up",
  "convoys of soldiers as they travelled on the roads.",
  "By the end of 1987 the press was writing of Sri Lanka as \u2018India\u2019s Viet-",

  "growing perception of itself as the \u2018rightful regional hegemon in South",
  "Asia\u2019.62 In demographic and economic terms it dominated the region, and it",
  "was now determined to express this dominance in terms of military prepared-",
  "ness as well. In January 1987 Indian infantry units mounted a large exercise",
  "on the Pakistan border, ostensibly to test new equipment but really to display",
  "to the old enemy a new-found power.63 Then, in March 1988, India tested its",

  "in northern India. The worst hit was the city of Bhagalpur, in Bihar, where",
  "Hindus and Muslims battled each other for a whole week in November. The",

  "and the aftermath of the Ram pujans generally, further polarized the com-",

  "the Hindu middle class was drawn into an open support of the BJP.68",
  "A third challenge to the prime minister came from his erstwhile Cabinet",
  "colleague V. P. Singh. As finance minister, Singh had conducted a series of",
  "raids on industrial houses accused of tax evasion. This was seen as exceed-",

  "In the public mind, the Bofors controversy was, rightly or wrongly,",
  "linked to the departure of V. P. Singh from the Cabinet. The appellation \u2018Mr",
  "Clean\u2019 was transferred from Rajiv Gandhi onto him. Singh left the Congress,",
  "and in June 1988 stood and won as a candidate of the combined opposition",
  "in a parliamentary by-election in Allahabad. By now he had become the focal",
  "point of a growing anti-Congress sentiment. In October 1988 his Jan Morcha",
  "was merged with the old Janata Party to form the Janata Dal. This new party",

  "ofrecentstoriesoncorruption;itwasa\u2018belatedpreemptivestrikebeforemore",
  "damage could be done to the government\u2019s image\u2019. It prompted a collective",

  "eventually dropped.71",
  "Then,inJanuary1989,RajivGandhivisitedChina,thefirstIndianprime",
  "ministertodosoinmorethanthreedecades.Thiswas,amongotherthings,an",

  "gents in India\u2019s north-east. Rajiv Gandhi had a ninety-minute conversation",
  "withthe84-year-old Deng Hsiao Ping, where he was told: \u2018You are the young.",
  "You are the future.\u201972",
  "Next, in March 1989, Rajiv Gandhi reversed the outward-looking,",
  "growth-oriented economic policies of his first years in office. In the last",

  "Still, Rajiv Gandhi was leaving nothing to chance. In his campaign for",
  "re-election he addressed 170 meetings in different parts of the country. As",

  "made more troubling by an alert press. Outside the country\u2019s borders nation-",
  "al prestige had been greatly damaged by the bloody nose given to the Indian",

  "In the summer of 1985 the Calcutta weekly Sunday, then at the height",

  "Rustomji in a withering but not in accurate characterization of the political",
  "purpose of those fanatics and demagogues. Then he added, \u2018In a few years",
  "even the votes may not be worth counting because we may have killed demo-",
  "cracy by then.\u201977",
  "These were recurrent themes in the press commentary of the period: that",
  "India would break up into pieces, or give up on democracy altogether. Writ-",
  "ing in April 1987, Sunday\u2019s own political editor Kewal Verma issued this dire",
  "warning:",
  "If Rajiv Gandhi continues to slip and no alternative emerges (. . .none is",
  "insightyet),itwillleadtopoliticaldestabilisationwithdisastrousconse-",

  "Rama Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid issue could lead to large-scale com-",
  "munal war in north India. A prolonged state of political uncertainty and",
  "instability would be an invitation to adventurous forces to intervene in",
  "the situation. For instance, if the President dismisses the Prime Minister,",
  "it may be [the Chief of Army Staff] Gen. Sundarji who will decide who",
  "should stay.78The writers quoted in this section were all Indians in their late fifties or early",
  "sixties, who had grown up in the warm glow of the Nehru years and re-",
  "membered the hopes with which the new nation was forged. Their sentiments",
  "were no doubt coloured by nostalgia, at least some of which was merited. For",
  "the politicians of Nehru\u2019s day had worked to contain social cleavages rather",

  "doubtedly was \u2013 could be more sympathetically read as a growing decentral-",
  "ization of the Indian polity, away from the hegemony of a single region (the",
  "north),a single party (the Congress), a single family (the Gandhis).",
  "One must reserve final comment on whether the gloom was really jus-",
  "tified. For as the very many forecasts previously quoted in this book have",
  "shown, every decade since Independence had been designated the \u2018most dan-",
  "gerous\u2019 thus far. If there was a novelty about these latest predictions, it was",
  "merely that they came from Indians rather than foreigners.",
  "XII",
  "With the end of the present chapter, this book moves from \u2018history\u2019 to what",
  "might instead be called \u2018historically informed journalism\u2019. Part Five, which",
  "follows, deals with the events of the last two decades, that is, with processes",
  "still unfolding. Given our closeness to what is being written about, it adopts",
  "a thematic rather than chronological approach. To ground the narrative,",
  "however, each chapter starts with a prediction from the past that in some way",
  "anticipated the future.",
  "The author of a study of the Assam movement published in 1983 re-",
  "marked that the book was \u2018almost contemporary history and contemporary",
  "history will not have the logic, the neatness in understanding, the conformity",
  "to patterns, that the passage of years gives to things\u2019.79 The author of a book",
  "onOperationBluestarpublishedin1994arguedthatadecadeorsoisperhaps",
  "the right amount of time to have elapsed before attempting to document con-",
  "temporary history. It is also the time when one can indulge in the luxury of",
  "introspection because events have ceased to colour one\u2019s judgement emotion-",

  "ing closed documents written during the past three decades. That seems justabout right, for once thirty years have passed any new \u2018disclosures\u2019 are un-",
  "likely materially to affect the lives of those still living.",
  "In my experience, to write about events as a historian one also needs a",
  "generation\u2019s distance. That much time must elapse before one can place those",
  "events in a pattern, to see them away and apart from the din and clamour of",
  "the present. Once roughly three decades have gone by, much more material is",
  "at hand \u2013 not just archives that are now open, but also memoirs, biographies",
  "and analytical works that have since been published.",
  "When writing about the very recent past one lacks the primary sources",
  "available for earlier periods. Besides, the historian is here writing about times",
  "that are close to him as well as his readers. He, and they, often have strong",
