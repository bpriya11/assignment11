  "In response to the Indian request, President Kennedy sanctioned the supply",
  "of a million rounds for machine guns, 40,000 land mines and 100,000 mortar",
  "rounds.4 This fell far short of the Grand Alliance that his ambassador was",
  "recommending; yet it was far in excess of what other Americans thought",
  "New Delhi deserved. A bitter opponent of arms supply to India was Senator",
  "Richard B. Russell of Georgia, the long-serving chairman of the Senate",
  "Armed Forces Committee. A crusty old reactionary \u2013 doughtily opposed to",
  "desegregation and the like \u2013 Russell had previously termed India an \u2018unreli-",
  "ablefriend\u2019andcalledNehrua\u2018demagogueandahypocrite\u2019.Nowhetoldthe",
  "AssociatedPressthathewas\u2018againstgivingIndiaanyofourmodernweapons",
  "for the principal reason that we would be just giving them to the Chinese",
  "Communists\u2019. The Indians, said the senator, had \u2018put on a disgraceful exhib-",
  "ition in permitting themselves to be driven out of what should have been im-",
  "pregnablestrongholdsinthebordermountains.Theyseemincapableoffight-",
  "ing and if we supply them with weapons they will just fall into the hands of",
  "the Communists\u2019. While he was at present opposed to giving \u2018one dime of",
  "weapons to India\u2019, Russell said he might have a rethink if India\u2019s old rulers,",
  "the British, were prepared to \u2018take over the matter of re-organizing and re-",
  "training their militaryforces\u2019.5",
  "Russell sremarks werewidely reported intheUnited States aswell asin",
  "India.Thestormofcorrespondencethatitgeneratedisauniqueprismthrough",
  "which one can view US\u2014India relations. One would expect the two coun-",
  "tries to have been allies, if only because both were large and culturally di-",
  "verse democracies. However, their relations had been clouded by suspicion",
  "on both sides suspicion of India\u2019s non-alignment on one side, and of Amer-",
  "ican military aid to Pakistan on the other. It did not help that these were both",
  "preachypeoples,whoseforeignpolicyanddiplomacywereinvariablyaccom-panied by an unctuous self-righteousness. Where democratic ideals sought to",
  "bring the two countries closer together, pride and patriotism pulled them fur-",
  "ther apart.",
  "Thus, while Kennedy and Galbraith might have deplored Senator Rus-",
  "sell\u2019s stand, he received much support from across Middle America. A cor-",
  "respondent from Wichita, Kansas, thanked the senator for warning that it was",
  "\u2018very dangerous for the US to make a doormat of itself to a country whose",
  "leaders have shown little interest or support to the US except to take our",

  "making\u2019; namely, the \u2018Neutralist Policy\u2019 which they followed even while \u2018the",
  "Communists have swallowed millions of people\u2019 the world over. An 85-year-",
  "old Democrat from South San Gabriel endorsed Russell\u2019s \u2018objection to this",

  "superstitious and ignorant juices.\u2019",
  "From his compatriots, Senator Russell received dozens of letters of con-",
  "gratulation, but only one of dissent. This was written by a Fulbright scholar",

  "Senator Russell\u2019s remarks brought to the fore the mutual misunderstand-",
  "ings between Indians and Americans as they had been up to 1962 \u2013 and bey-",
  "ond. Behind these lay different perceptions of foreign policy and national in-",
  "terest, and also a certain incompatibility of cultures. The two peoples ate,",
  "drank, sang, dressed and thought differently. As an admirer in Jacksonville",
  "wrote to the Senator: \u2018This Nehru, technically Caucasian, politically nothing",
  "ofthe sort...Howcan there bea\u201cmeeting ofminds\u201d with aman whostands",
  "on his head?\u2019 The reference was to Jawaharlal Nehru\u2019s love of yoga, a form",
  "of therapy then completely alien to the American way of life.6",
  "III",
  "The defeat by China caused the prime minister a certain loss of face in the",
  "international arena. It also undermined his position at home. Criticism of his",
  "leadership grew more strident. In the summer of 1963 the Congress lost a",
  "series of important by-elections, which put into Parliament three opposition",
  "stalwarts: Minoo Masani, J. B. Kripalani and Rammanohar Lohia.",
  "In June 1963 Nehru held a press conference, his first in many months.",
  "The meeting lasted ninety minutes, and was notable for the anger the prime",
  "minister directed at the Chinese. He spoke of the \u2018dark spate of falsehoods",
  "emanatingfromPeking\u2019,andoftheir\u2018highrecordinvituperation\u2019.Explaining",
  "the war, and India\u2019s defeat therein, Nehru claimed that \u2018the Chinese are a",
  "military-minded nation, always laying stress on military roads and prepared-",
  "ness . . . Right from the beginning of the present regime there, they have con-",
  "centrated on the military apparatus being stronger. It is a continuation really",
  "of the past civil wars. So, they are normally strong.\u20197Nehru also said that in attacking him personally, the Chinese \u2018have",
  "something in common with some of our opposition leaders here\u2019. He then ad-",
  "ded, gratuitously: \u2018As for our opposition leaders, they have the habit of com-",
  "bining with anybody and everybody regardless of principle and a time may",
  "come when some of them may for the purpose combine with the Chinese\u2019.",

  "ducea\u2018no-confidence\u2019motioninParliament,anactofdaringthatwouldhave",
  "been inconceivable at any time between August 1947 and November 1962.",
  "The Congress had the numbers to easily defeat the vote, but the debate lasted",
  "all of four days, during which a series of telling points were made against the",
  "prime minister, his party, and his government.8",
  "The criticisms in and out of Parliament prompted a serious rethink",
  "among the Congress leadership. Fifteen years in power had made the party",
  "complacent, somewhat out of touch with happenings on the ground \u2013 as evid-",
  "enced in the recent by-election defeats and the growing strength of regional",
  "parties like the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK). The chief minister of",
  "Madras,K.Kamaraj,washimselfmostthreatenedbytheDMK;now,tocheck",
  "its rise and stem the rot within, he recommended that senior Congress minis-",

  "he had once venerated: at a Congress session in Madras, where Nehru stood",
  "\u2018sprightly, slim and erect\u2019; at his home in Allahabad, where Nehru \u2018jumped",
  "two steps at a time, with me emulating him, as I followed him upstairs\u2019.10",
  "WhereIndianswouldnotspeculateopenlyaboutNehru\u2019sdeath,Western",
  "observers were under no such inhibition. In 1963 the American journalist",
  "Wells Hangen published a book with the title After Nehru, Who? This listed",
  "eight possible successors, each of whom was allotted a separate chapter. Six",
  "were from the Congress Party: Morarji Desai, V. K. Krishna Menon, Y. B.",
  "Chavan,LalBahadurShastri,S.K.Patilandthesolefemalecandidate,Indira",
  "Gandhi. A seventh possibility was the social worker and sometime social-ist revolutionary Jayaprakash Narayan. The last listed was a general \u2013 B. M.",
  "Kaul.11",
  "The question now being asked was not just \u2018After Nehru, Who?\u2019 , but",
  "also \u2018After Nehru, What?\u2019 Shortly after the publication of Hangen\u2019s book,",
  "a reporter from the Sunday Times of London spent several weeks travel-",
  "ling through India. He met the prime minister, to find that \u2018old Nehru has",
  "gone downhill so fast recently\u2019. The decay of the man mirrored the decay",
  "of his country. In contrast to the \u2018intensity and unfathomable ambition of a",
  "wild young China\u2019, India was a land of \u2018indescribable poverty\u2019 and a \u2018will-",
  "less Government\u2019. What would happen after Nehru passed on? The reporter",
  "thought that the battle \u2018will lie between the Communists and the new gener-",
  "ation of political bandits emerging in the States. . .\u2019 . A third contender was",
  "the army; thus far, the generals had stayed aloof from politics, but would they",

  "One place that the prime minister could have gone to, but chose not to,",
  "was Nagaland. For a state of that name had finally come into existence on 1",
  "December 1963. In other circumstances Nehru would have been keen to in-",
  "augurate it himself. But the journey to Kohima was long and arduous, and",

  "The China war had weakened Nehru\u2019s position not just in India or the world,",
  "but within the Congress Party itself. The locus of decision-making had now",
  "shifted from the prime minister\u2019s home to the Congress Parliamentary Party.",
  "Unlikeinthepast,Nehrucouldnolongergetthepartytoalwaysdohisbidding",
  "in matters big and small.17 For instance, he had not welcomed the Kamaraj",
  "plan, on the grounds that it would deplete his government of experience and",
  "talent.",
  "After his illness, Nehru was able to persuade the party to return Lal Ba-",
  "hadur Shastri to the Cabinet. Shastri was officially called \u2018minister without",
  "portfolio\u2019, but in fact functioned as the de facto deputy to the prime minister.",
  "The two shared a language, a home state and a history of being in the same",
  "jails at around the same time. Nehru trusted and liked Shastri, whose own",
  "quiet, understated personality was in such marked contrast to his own.",
  "The first assignment entrusted to Shastri pertained to the state of Jammu",
  "and Kashmir. On 27 December 1963 a major crisis had been sparked by the",
  "theft of a holy relic, a hair of the Prophet Mohammed, from the Hazratbal",
  "mosque in Srinagar. A week after it vanished, the relic mysteriously reap-",
  "peared in the mosque. No one knew how it came back, just as no one knew",
  "howithadvanishedinthefirstplace.Andnooneknewwhethertherelicnow",
  "in place was the genuine article, or a fake.",
  "Through the month of January there were protests and demonstrations",
  "in the Valley. The ripples spread through the Muslim world. In distant East",
  "Pakistan there were religious riots aimed at the minority Hindu community,",
  "hundreds of thousands of whom fled to India. Now there was the danger of",
  "retaliatory riots targeting Muslims in India itself.In the last week of January Nehru dispatched Lal Bahadur Shastri to",
  "Kashmir. After speaking to officials, and consulting local politicians, Shastri",
  "decided to hold a special showing, or deedar, to certify whether the returned",
  "relic was genuine. A panel of senior clerics was constituted to view the relic.",
  "They did so on 3 February, and to palpable relief all round decided that this",
  "was the real article. Calm returned to the Valley. To keep the peace going the",
  "government of India appointed, as chief minister, G. M. Sadiq, a politician",
  "known for his left-wing views, but also forhisintegrity.18",
  "The Hazratbal incident brought home, once more, the fact that trouble in",
  "Kashmir had its repercussions on life in the subcontinent as a whole. The Ch-",
  "ina fiasco had made Nehru more alert to the need to seek a final resolution of",
  "the Kashmir dispute. For India could not afford to have two hostile fronts. He",
  "was encouraged in this line of thinking by his old friend Lord Mountbatten.",
  "In April 1963 Mountbatten had told Nehru that \u2018if his glory had at one time,",
  "brought India credit\u2019 in the world, the country, and he, now had a \u2018tarnished",
  "image\u2019, principally owing to the failure to settle the question of Kashmir. The",
  "Englishman felt that this could be \u2018rectified\u2019 by a \u2018heroic gesture by India\u2019,",
  "such as the \u2018granting of independence to the [Kashmir] valley regardless of",
  "the Pakistani attitude\u2019.19",
  "In fact, during 1962 and 1963 there were several rounds of talks with",
  "Pakistan on the issues that divided the two countries. Here, the government",
  "of India was represented by the experienced Sardar Swaran Singh, while",
  "Pakistan was represented by the young and ambitious Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto.",
  "At these talks no one represented Kashmir. But, as the Hazratbal incident",
  "showed, it was not prudent to neglect the feelings of the people at the centre",
  "of the dispute. And who better to take their pulse than Sheikh Abdullah? By",
  "the end of 1963 Nehru was already thinking of releasing the Sheikh, who by",
  "this time had been in jail for ten years. The stroke at Bhubaneshwar, with its",
  "intimations of mortality, made him think further in this regard. Why not re-",
  "lease Abdullah and have a last shot at solving the Kashmir problem before he",
  "was gone?",
  "V",
  "SheikhAbdullah,wemayrecall,hadbeenarrestedbythegovernmentofIndia",
  "in August 1953. No charges were brought against him, but in January 1958",
  "he was suddenly released. He made his way to the Valley, where he met witha spectacular reception. He addressed well-attended public meetings in Srin-",
  "agar,includingoneattheHazratbalmosque.Thisseemstohaveunnervedhis",
  "enemies in the administration. Towards the end of April he was arrested once",
  "more. This time he was shifted to a jail in Jammu, and charged with plotting",
  "with Pakistan to break up India. He was accused, among other things, of at-",
  "tempting \u2018to facilitate wrongful annexation of the territories of the state by",
  "Pakistan; create communal ill-feeling and disharmony in the state and receive",
  "secret aid from Pakistan in the shape of money, bombs, etc.\u2019.20",
  "The charges were, to put it politely, trumped up. While the Sheikh con-",
  "templatedindependence,heneverwantedtojoinPakistan.Andwhiletheidea",
  "ofbeingtherulerofafreeKashmirappealedtohim,hesawashissubjectsall",
  "the people of the state, regardless of religion. As even his political opponents",
  "conceded, he had not a communal bone in his body.",
  "Speaking at his trial, the Sheikh said that he stood for a single objective:",
  "the right ofself-determination forthe people ofJammu andKashmir,who,he",
  "insisted,were\u2018notaflockofsheepandgoatstobedrivenbyforceonewayor",

  "state are the final arbiters of their fate\u2019 , significantly adding: \u2018He does not, I",
  "believe, deny this right to us even now.\u201921",
  "Two months after the Sheikh\u2019s first arrest, in 1953, Nehru had written",
  "that \u2018the mere fact of his detention is of course a matter which troubles",
  "me greatly\u2019.22 The months turned into years, deepening the guilt. One way",
  "of sublimating the guilt was to take a close interest in the education of his",
  "friend\u2019s children (which, by some accounts, he even helped pay for). In July",
  "1955 Nehru was visited by Abdullah\u2019s eldest son, Farooq, then studying in a",
  "medical college in Jaipur. Farooq told the prime minister that his classmates",
  "routinely referred to his father as a \u2018traitor\u2019. This prompted Nehru to write to",
  "a minister in the Rajasthan state government, asking him to ensure that the",
  "boy had \u2018proper living quarters and some friendly companionship\u2019, so that he",
  "did not develop any \u2018complexes and the like\u2019 . As Nehru put it, \u2018Some people",
  "foolishlyimaginethatbecausewehavehaddifferenceswithSheikhAbdullah,",
  "therefore we are not favourably inclined towards his son and his family. This,",
  "ofcourse,isnotonlyabsurdbutisjustthereverseofhowwefeel.Personally,",

  "matter of pain to the government, and particularly to the prime minister'.)24",
  "On the morning of 8 April the Sheikh stepped out of Jammu jail, a free",
  "man once more. He drove in an open car through the streets of the town, ac-",
  "cepting garlands and bouquets. The next day he gave his first public speech.",
  "According to a newspaper report, \u2018Sheikh Abdullah said the two pressing",
  "problems facing thesubcontinent \u2013communal strife andKashmir \u2013shouldbe",
  "solved during Prime Minister Nehru\u2019s lifetime. He described Mr Nehru as the",
  "last of the stalwarts who had worked with Gandhiji and said that after him a",
  "solution of these problems would become difficult.\u2019",
  "Nehru had invited Abdullah to come and stay with him in New Delhi.",
  "The Sheikh said he would first go to the Valley, consult his friends and sup-",
  "porters, and meet the Prime Minister after the Id festival (which fell on 23",
  "April).Onthe11thhesetoffbycartoSrinagar,ajourneythatnormallywould",
  "take a few hours. But the Sheikh travelled leisurely, stopping at towns and",
  "villages on the way. Wherever he halted, he also spoke. Thousands turned up",
  "to see and hear him, trudging miles from their own isolated hamlets. In these",
  "gatherings, women outnumbered men.",
  "In his speeches, Abdullah described his state as a bride cherished by two",
  "husbands \u2013 India and Pakistan \u2013 neither of whom \u2018cared to ascertain what the",
  "Kashmiris wanted\u2019. He said he would meet Jawaharlal Nehru with an open",
  "mind, and asked the Indians not to make up their minds beforehand either. As",
  "a journalist who interviewed him noted, the Sheikh had \u2018no personal bitter-",
  "ness, no rancour\u2019 \u2013 rather, he was imbued with \u2018a strong sense of mission\u2019, a",
  "compellingdesiretoseekasolutiontoKashmir.Atonemeetinghewasasked",
  "what he now felt about Nehru. Abdullah answered that he bore no ill will, for",
  "\u2018misunderstandings do occur even among brothers. I shall not forget the love",
  "Mr Nehru has showered onme in the past ...Iwill meet him as an old friend",
  "and comrade.\u2019",
  "On 18 April a week after he had left Jammu the Sheikh drove in an open",
  "jeep from Anantnag to the Kashmiri capital Srinagar. The thirty-mile route",
  "was lined by a \u2018near-hysterical crowd\u2019 of half a million people. The road was",
  "coveredwithfreshlypluckeddaisiesandtulipsandfestoonedwitharchesand",
  "bunting. When he finally entered the town, \u2018Srinagar\u2019s entire population . . .",
  "jammed the labyrinth of streets which were so richly decorated that even the",
  "sun did not penetrate the canopy of Kashmir silks, carpets and shawls\u2019.Meanwhile, back in Delhi, the prospect of talks between Nehru and Ab-",
  "dullah alarmed many members of the ruling Congress Party. Senior Cabin-",
  "et ministers issued statements insisting that the question of Kashmir was",
  "\u2018closed\u2019;thestatewas,andwouldstay,anintegralpartofIndia.Morecombat-",
  "ive still were members of the Jana Sangh. The party\u2019s general secretary, Deen",
  "DayalUpadhyaya,deploredtheSheikh\u2019srecentspeeches,whereheseemedto",
  "have \u2018questioned even the axiomatic facts of the Kashmir question\u2019 (such as",
  "itsfinalaccessiontoIndia).\u2018Insteadofstabilizingthepoliticalsituationofthe",
  "state\u2019, complained Upadhyaya, \u2018Sheikh Abdullah has tried to unsettle every",
  "issue.\u2019",
  "The opposition from the Hindu right was predictable. As it happens, the",
  "leftwasalsosuspiciousofAbdullahandhisintentions.TheCommunistParty",
  "thought he was in danger of falling into an \u2018imperialist trap\u2019, designed to de-",
  "tach Kashmir from India. Among the Indian political establishment, it seems,",
  "only Nehru\u2019s mind remained open. But he was to receive unexpected support",
  "from two old stalwarts who had also worked with Mahatma Gandhi. One was",
  "Jayaprakash Narayan, popularly known as \u2018JP\u2019, the former radical socialist",
  "who for the past decade had been a leading light of the Sarvodaya movement.",
  "JPwasanoldfriendoftheSheikh;hehadalsobeenavocaladvocateofbetter",
  "relationswithPakistan.In1962hehadsetupanIndia\u2014PakistanConciliation",
  "Group which, among other things, sought to find an \u2018equitable and honour-",
  "able\u2019 solution to the Kashmir dispute.25",
  "Now,welcomingSheikhAbdullah\u2019sreleaseinasignedarticleintheHin-",
  "dustanTimes,JPdeploredtheinsinuations against Abdullahbypoliticians in-",
  "sideandoutsidetheCongress.Thesehadthreatenedthathewouldbeputback",
  "in jail if he went \u2018too far\u2019. \u2018It is remarkable\u2019, commented JP acidly, \u2018how the",
  "freedom fighters of yesterday begin so easily to imitate the language of the",
  "imperialists.\u2019",
  "What alarmed politicians in Delhi was the Sheikh\u2019s talk about ascertain-",
  "ing afresh the wishes of the Kashmiri people. JP thought this eminently reas-",
  "onable, for the elections in Jammu and Kashmir in 1957 and 1962 were any-",
  "thing but free and fair. In any case, if India was \u2018so sure of the verdict of the",
  "people,whyarewesoopposedtogivingthemanotheropportunitytoreiterate",
  "it? A satisfactory settlement of the Kashmir question would greatly improve",
  "relationsbetweenIndiaandPakistan.JPhopedthattheleadersofIndiawould",
  "display \u2018the vision and statesmanship that this historic moment demands\u2019. He",
  "added, \u2018Happily, the one sane voice in the ruling party is that of the Prime",
  "Minister himself.\u201926More unexpected perhaps was the endorsement received by Nehru from",
  "C.Rajagopalachari(\u2018Rajaji\u2019),theveteranstatesmanwhohadoncebeenanin-",
  "timate associate of the prime minister but had latterly become apolitical op-",
  "ponent. As the founder of the Swatantra Party, Rajaji had savaged the prime",
  "minister\u2019seconomic policies. Thesecriticisms sometimes hadasharpperson-",
  "al edge. Now, to the surprise of his followers, he came out strongly in favour",
  "of Nehru\u2019s initiative in releasing Abdullah. Like JP, he deplored the threats to",
  "put the Sheikh back in jail, thus to \u2018force him into silence and submission\u2019.",
  "Fortunately, \u2018the Prime Minister may be ill but he preserves his balance, and",
  "has evidently refused to take any foolish step and degrade India\u2019.",
  "The freeing of Abdullah, argued Rajaji, should act as a prelude to allow-",
  "ing \u2018the people of Kashmir [to] exercise their human right to rule themselves",
  "as well as they can\u2019. Indeed, solving the Kashmir tangle would pave the way",
  "for a larger resolution of the Indo-Pak dispute itself. Thus, Rajaji wrote of the",
  "need to",
  "try and think fundamentally in the present crisis. Are we to yield to the",
  "fanatical emotions of our anti-Pakistan groups? Is there any hope for In-",
  "dia or for Pakistan, if we go on hating each other, suspecting each other,",
  "borrowing and building up armaments against each other \u2013 building our",
  "two houses, both of us on the sands of continued foreign aid against a",
  "future Kurukshetra? We shall surely ruin ourselves forever if we go on",
  "doing this . . . We shall be making all hopes of prosperity in the future",
  "a mere mirage if we continue this arms race based on an ancient grudge",
  "and the fears and suspicions flowing from it.27",
  "VI",
  "In Kashmir, meanwhile, Sheikh Abdullah was talking to his colleagues and",
  "associates. He discovered that while he had been in jail, he had come to be",
  "associated with the Pakistan party. At his trial Abdullah had insisted that he",
  "never expressed a desire for Kashmir to join Pakistan. India or independence",
  "\u2013thoseweretheonlytwooptionshehadcountenanced.Butthetrialproceed-",
  "ings never reached the common people of the Valley. They knew only that he",
  "was being tried for conspiracy against the Indian nation. Would not that make",
  "him, by default, a friend of Pakistan?Thecommonpeoplewerestrengthenedintheirbeliefsbythepropaganda",
  "of Bakshi Ghulam Mohammed\u2019s government, which had painted the Sheikh",
  "as an agitator for a plebiscite, and hence anti-Indian. Moreover, the chicanery",
  "and corruption of the Bakshi regime had greatly tarnished the image of India",
  "among the Kashmiris. Abdullah found that the pro-Pakistani elements were",
  "now perhaps in a majority. This did not please him. But, sensing the mood",
  "on the ground, he worked to gradually win over the people to his point of",
  "view. He met the influential priest Maulvi Farooqui and urged him to support",
  "a\u2018realistic\u2019solution,ratherthanclaimthatKashmirshouldaccedetoPakistan",
  "in pursuance of the two-nation theory.28",
  "On 23 April, two weeks after he was released, Sheikh Abdullah ad-",
  "dressed a prayer meeting in Srinagar. A solution to the Kashmir dispute,",
  "he said, must take into account its likely consequences for the 50 million",
  "MuslimsinIndia,andthe10millionHindusinEastPakistan.Threedayslater,",
  "in his last speech before leaving for Delhi, he urged the Kashmiris to main-",
  "tain communal peace, to thus set an example for both India and Pakistan. \u2018No",
  "Muslim in Kashmir will ever raise his hand against the minorities,\u2019 he pro-",
  "claimed.",
  "On28April,thedaybeforeAbdullahwasduetoarriveinDelhi,theJana",
  "Sangh held a large procession in the capital. The marchers shouted anti-Ab-",
  "dullahandanti-NehruslogansanddemandedthatthegovernmentofIndiaab-",
  "rogateArticle370anddeclareKashmirtobean\u2018integralandindivisible\u2019part",
  "of India. At a public meeting held the same day, A. B. Vajpayee demanded",
  "that the prime minister tell Abdullah that Jammu and Kashmir had \u2018already",
  "been integrated with the Indian Union and that there was no scope for discus-",
  "sion on this matter\u2019.",
  "On the 29th Abdullah flew into Palam airport with his principal associ-",
  "ates. The party drove on to Teen Murti House, where the prime minister was",
  "waiting to receive Abdullah. It was the first time the two men had seen one",
  "another since Nehru\u2019s government had locked up the Sheikh in August 1953.",
  "Now, as one eyewitness wrote, \u2018the two embraced each other warmly. They",
  "were meeting after 11 years, but the way they greeted each other reflected no",
  "traces of embarrassment, let aside bitterness over what happened in the inter-",
  "vening period\u2019. The duo posed for the battery of press photographers before",
  "going inside.",
  "This was a reconciliation between the leader of the nation and a man till",
  "recentlyregardedasatraitortoit.Itanticipated,bysomethirtyyears,thesim-",
  "ilarly portentous reconciliation between the South African president and hismostnotoriouspoliticalprisoner.ButevenF.W.DeKlerkdidnotgosofaras",

  "to prominent non-political figures such as Jayaprakash Narayan. He placed a",
  "wreath on Gandhi\u2019s tomb in Rajghat and addressed a prayer meeting at Delhi",
  "s greatest mosque, the Jama Masjid.",
  "That Nehru was talking to Abdullah was not to the liking of the Jana",
  "Sangh. Notably, it also caused disquiet among members of his own Cabinet,",
  "who worried that the Kashmir question would now be \u2018re-opened\u2019. To pre-",
  "empt the possibility, a senior minister told Parliament that the \u2018maintenance",
  "of the status quo [in Kashmir] was in the best interests of the subcontinent\u2019",
  ".Andtwenty-sevenCongressMPsissuedastatementarguingthat\u2018youcanno",
  "moretalkofself-determinationinthecaseofKashmirthaninthecaseof,say,",
  "Bombay or Bihar\u2019.",
  "Within his party, the only senior man who appeared sympathetic to",
  "Nehru\u2019s efforts was Lal Bahadur Shastri. There were, however, some opposi-",
  "tion politicians who saw the point of speaking seriously with Abdullah. Thus",
  "the Swatantra Party leader Minoo Masani urgently wired Rajaji:",
  "Understand Nehru and Lal Bahadur endeavouring to find solution with",
  "Sheikh Abdullah but are up against confused thinking within Congress",
  "Party alongside of Jan Sangh communist combination. If you think tele-",
  "gram or letter to Jawaharlal from yourself encouraging him [to] do the",
  "right thing and assuring your personal support would help please move",
  "in the matter.29",
  "RajajichosenottowritetoNehru,perhapsbecausehewastooproudorfeared",

  "some kind of autonomous status. As he saw it, \u2018self-determination for Kash-",
  "mir is as far as we are concerned a lesser issue than the aim of reducing Indo-",
  "Pak jealousy\u2019. He thought that \u2018the idea that if we \u201clet Kashmir go\u201d, we shall",
  "be encouraging secessions everywhere is thoroughly baseless\u2019. \u2019I hope you",
  "and Jawaharlalji\u2019, wrote Rajaji to Shastri, \u2018will be guided by Providence and",
  "bring this great opportunity to a good result.\u201930Shortly after his release Abdullah had expressed his wish to \u2018pay my re-",
  "spects personally toRajaji, andhavethebenefit ofhismature advice\u2019.31Now,",
  "after his conversations with Nehru, he setoff south to meet the prime minis-",
  "ter\u2019s friend turned rival turned ally. He planned to stop at Wardha en route, to",
  "pay his respects to the Gandhian leader Vinoba Bhave. As he jokingly told a",
  "journalist, he would discuss \u2018spirituality with Vinoba and \u2018practical politics\u2019",
  "with Rajaji.",
  "On 4 May Lal Bahadur Shastri wrote to Rajaji urging him \u2018to suggest to",
  "Sheikh Saheb not to take any extreme line . . . Sheikh Saheb has just come",
  "out [of jail] and it would be good for him to give further thought to the dif-",
  "ferent aspects oftheKashmir question andcome toajudgement after fulland",
  "matureintrospectionanddeliberation.Itwillbemostunfortunateifthingsare",
  "done in a hurry or precipitated\u2019.32",
  "This was an airmail letter, but one does not know whether it reached",
  "Madras before the 5th, on which day Abdullah finally met Rajaji. They spoke",
  "forafullthreeandahalfhours,provokingthisfrontpageheadlineintheHin-",
  "dustan Times: \u2018Abdullah, CR, Evolve Kashmir Formula: Proposal to Be Dis-",
  "cussed with Prime Minister\u2019. Rajaji did not say a word to the press, but Ab-",
  "dullah was slightly more forthcoming. Speaking to the wise old man, he said,",
  "\u2018hadhelpedclearhismindaboutwhatwouldbethebestsolutionwhichwould",
  "remove this cancer from the body politic of India and Pakistan\u2019. Pressed for",
  "details, the Sheikh said these would have to await further talks with the prime",
  "minister. He did let on, however, that Rajaji and he had worked out \u2018an hon-",
  "ourable solution which would not give a sense of victory either to India or",
  "Pakistanandatthesametimewouldensureaplaceofhonourtothepeopleof",
  "Kashmir\u2019.",
  "While Abdullah was in Madras, word reached him that President Ayub",
  "Khan had invited him to visit Pakistan. On returning to Delhi on 6 May he",
  "went straight to Teen Murti House. He spent ninety minutes with Nehru, ap-",
  "prisinghimofwhatwasbeingreferredto,somewhatmysteriously,as\u2018theRa-",
  "jaji formula\u2019. The prime minister next directed Abdullah to an informal com-",
  "mitteeofadvisers.Thisconsistedoftheforeignsecretary,Y.D.Gundevia,the",
  "high commissioner to Pakistan, G. Parthasarathi, and the vice-chancellor of",
  "the Aligarh Muslim University, Badruddin Tyabji.",
  "Over two long days, Abdullah and the prime minister\u2019s men discussed",
  "the Kashmir issue threadbare. All kinds of alternatives were mooted. These",
  "included a plebiscite for the entire, undivided state of Jammu and Kashmir",
  "as it existed before 1947; the maintenance of the status quo; and afresh di-",
  "vision of the state, such that the Jammu and Ladakh regions went to India,Azad or northern Kashmir went to Pakistan, with a plebiscite being held in",
  "the Valley alone to decide its future. Abdullah told the officials that while",
  "they could work out the specifics of the solution, it must (1) promote Indo-",
  "Pakistani friendship; (2) not weaken the secular ideal of the Indian Constitu-",
  "tion; (3) not weaken the position of the minorities in either country. He asked",
  "them to give him more than one alternative, which he could take with him to",
  "Pakistan.",
  "The Sheikh\u2019s conditions more or less ruled out a plebiscite, the result",
  "of which, whatever it might be, would leave one country dissatisfied and",
  "minorities on both sides more vulnerable. What about the Rajaji formula?",
  "This, it appears, was for a condominium over Kashmir between India and",
  "Pakistan, with defence and external affairs being the joint responsibility of",
  "the two governments. (The model here was Andorra, a tiny but autonomous",
  "enclave whose security was guaranteed by its two large neighbours, France",
  "and Spain.) Another possibility was of creating a confederation among India,",
  "PakistanandKashmir.33",
  "ThetrinityadvisingNehruwereselectedfortheirabilityandknowledge;",
  "it is noteworthy nonetheless that they came from three different religious tra-",
  "ditions. It is noteworthy too that all were officials. Recall that when there was",
  "a chance to settle the dispute with China, the jingoism of the politicians com-",
  "pelled Nehru to take positions more hardline than he otherwise might have",
  "done. Now, in seeking a settlement with Pakistan, Nehru sought to work with",
  "hisofficials,ratherthanhisministers.Thewisdomofthisapproachwasmade",
  "clear in a letter written to Rajaji by the writer and parliamentarian B. Shiva",
  "Rao. This noted that",
  "ThereisaclearattemptbothfromwithintheCabinetandinParliamentto",
  "prevent the Prime Minister from coming to terms with Sheikh Abdullah",
  "if it should mean the reopening of the issue of accession. Many of these",
  "Ministershavemadepublicstatementswhilethediscussionsbetweenthe",
  "two are going on. It\u2019s a sign of the diminishing prestige and influence of",
  "the PM that they can take such liberties.",
  "This was interesting, but the reply was more interesting still. This gave more",
  "flesh to the \u2018Rajaji formula\u2019, while locating Nehru\u2019s predicament in proper",
  "perspective. Thus, wrote Rajaji,Asking Ayub Khan to give a commitment in advance about Azad Kash-",
  "mir now will break up the whole scheme. He will and cannot give it. He",
  "is in a worse situation than Nehru in regard to public pressures and emo-",
  "tional bondage . . . Any plan should therefore leave the prizes of war un-",
  "touched . . . Probably the best procedure is for Sheikh to concentrate on",
  "the valley leaving Jammu as a counterpoise to Azad Kashmir, to be pre-",
  "sumed to be integrated to India without question.",
  "This reduced shape of the problem is good enough, if solved as we",
  "desire, to bring about an improvement in the Indo-Pakistan relationship.",
  "And being of reduced size, would be a fitting subject for UN trusteeship",
  "partial or complete.34",
  "OntheIndianside,thebesthopeforpeacewasJawaharlalNehru.SheikhAb-",
  "dullah appears to have thought that Nehru was also the last hope. On 11 May",
  "the Sheikh told reporters that \u2018I do not want to plead for Nehru but he is the",
  "symbol of India in spite of his weakness. You cannot find another man like",
  "him.\u2019Headdedthat\u2018afterNehruhedidnotseeanyoneelsetackling[theprob-",
  "lems] with the same breadth of vision\u2019.",
  "For his part, Nehru was also quite prepared to give his old comrade and",
  "sometime adversary a sterling certificate of character. Speaking to the All-In-",
  "dia Congress Committee in Bombay on the 16th, the prime minister said that",
  "the Sheikh was wedded to the principles of secularism. Nor did he believe in",
  "the two-nation theory. Both Nehru and he hoped that \u2018it would be possible",
  "for India, holding on to her principles, to live in peace and friendship with",
  "Pakistan and thus incidentally to put an end to the question of Kashmir\u2019. \u2018I",
  "cannot say if we will succeed in this\u2019, said the prime minister, \u2018but it is clear",
  "that unless we succeed India will carry the burden of conflict with Pakistan",
  "with all that this implies.\u2019",
  "VII",
  "On 20 May, Sheikh Abdullah returned to Delhi, to stay at Teen Murti House",
  "and have a final round of talks with Nehru before travelling to Pakistan. At",
  "a press conference on the 22nd, Nehru declined to disclose the details, say-",
  "ingthat hedidnotwanttoprejudice theSheikh\u2019smission. Buthedidindicate",
  "that his government was \u2018prepared to have an agreement with Pakistan on the",
  "basis of their holding on to that part of Kashmir occupied by them\u2019.35Nehru\u2019s own papers on this subject are closed to scholars, but a letter",
  "written by his foreign secretary gives a clue to his thinking at the time. The",
  "prime minister had apparently asked legal experts to explore the implications",
  "of a confederation between India, Pakistan and Kashmir, \u2018as a possible solu-",
  "tion to our present troubles\u2019. Such an arrangement would not imply an \u2018an-",
  "nulment\u2019 of Partition. India and Pakistan would remain separate, sovereign",
  "states. Kashmir would be part of the confederation, with its exact status to be",
  "determined by dialogue. There might be a customs union of the three units,",
  "someformoffinancialintegrationandspecialprovisionsfortheprotectionof",
  "minorities.36",
  "To keep the discussion going, India was prepared to concede Pakistan\u2019 s",
  "hold over Azad Kashmir and Gilgit, the two parts of the state that it had lost",
  "in the war of 1947-8. Would Pakistan concede anything in turn? As Abdullah",
  "preparedtodepartforRawalpindi,MinooMasaniwrotetoA.K.Brohi,some-",
  "time Pakistani highcommissioner toIndia andnowaleading Karachi lawyer,",
  "a certified member of the Pakistani Establishment who had the ear of Presid-",

  "fluence in strengthening or weakening the hands of those who stand for Indo-",
  "Pakistan amity here\u2019. Nehru\u2019s Pakistan initiative was bitterly opposed from",
  "within his party and outside it. For it to make progress, for there to be a sum-",
  "mit meeting between the prime minister and President Ayub Khan, it was \u2018of",
  "the highest moment that Sheikh Abdullah should come back with something",
  "onwhichfuturetalkscouldbebased\u2019.MasaniurgedBrohitousehisinfluence",
  "with Ayub and other leaders, so that their talks with Abdullah might \u2018yield",
  "fruitful results in the interests of both countries\u2019.37",
  "Meanwhile, Abdullah proceeded to Pakistan. He hoped to spend two",
  "weeks in that country, beginning with the capital, Rawalpindi, moving on to",
  "AzadKashmirandendingwithEastPakistan,whereheintended,amongother",
  "things, to check on the feelings of the Hindu minority. On 24 May he touched",
  "down in Rawalpindi to a tumultuous reception. He drove in an open car from",
  "the airport to the town, the route lined by thousands of cheering Pakistanis.",
  "The welcome, said one reporter, \u2018surpassed in intensity and depth that given",
  "to Mr Chou En-lai in February\u2019.38",
  "Later, talking to newsmen, Abdullah called his visit \u2018a peace mission of",
  "an exploratory nature\u2019. He appealed to the press to help cultivate friendship",
  "between India and Pakistan. \u2018He said he had come to the definite conclusion",
  "that the armed forces of both the countries facing each other on the ceasefire",
  "line must be disengaged and that the edifice of a happy and prosperous Kash-mir could be built only on permanent friendship between India and Pakistan\u2019.",
  "AsinNewDelhi,heretooheemphasizedthatanysolutiontothedisputemust",
  "not foster a sense of defeat for either India or Pakistan; must not weaken In-",

  "aspirations of the Kashmiris themselves.",
  "Thenextday,the25th,AbdullahandAyubKhanheldathree-hourmeet-",

  "in Rawalpindi \u2018the same encouraging response as in Delhi. There is an equal",
  "keenness on both sides to come to a real understanding\u2019.",
  "Later that day Abdullah addressed a mammoth public meeting in",
  "Rawalpindi. He was \u2018cheered repeatedly as he spoke for two hours, bluntly",
  "warning both Indians and Pakistanis from committing wrongs which would",
  "endanger the lives of the minorities in both countries\u2019. The time had come,",
  "said Abdullah, for India and Pakistan to bury the hatchet. For if \u2018the present",
  "phase of tension, distrust and misunderstanding continued, both countries",
  "would suffer and their freedom be imperilled\u2019.",
  "Onthe26thAbdullahmetAyubKhanagain,forfourhoursthistime,and",

  "The meeting would take place in Delhi, and Abdullah would also be in the",
  "city, available for consultation. \u2018Of all the irritants that cause tension between",
  "India and Pakistan\u2019, said the Sheikh, \u2018Kashmir is the most important. Once",
  "thisgreatirritantisremoved,thesolutionofotherproblemswouldnotpresent",

  "By this time the enchantment with the Sheikh was wearing thin among",
  "the Pakistani elite. Their representative voice, the Dawn newspaper, wrote of",
  "howAbdullah\u2019sstatements,\u2018especiallyhisreferencestoIndia\u2019sso-calledsec-",
  "ularism, have caused a certain amount of disappointment among the public",
  "in general and the intelligentsia in particular\u2019. Dawn thought that the Sheikh",
  "had been \u2018lured by the outward show of Indian secularism, obviously forget-",
  "ting the inhumane treatment meted out to 60 million Muslims in the so-called",
  "secular state\u2019. But the newspaper had amore fundamental complaint, that Ab-",
  "dullah had \u2018taken up the role of an apostle of peace and friendship between",
  "PakistanandIndia,ratherthanthatoftheleaderofKashmir,whoseprimeob-",
  "jective should be to seek their freedom from Indian bondage\u2019.39",
  "Onthe27thAbdullahproceededtoMuzaffarabad,atownhehadnotseen",
  "sinceKashmirwasdividedin1947.HehadnoideaofhowtheKashmiristhis",
  "side of the ceasefire line would react to his proposals. Before he could find",
  "out, news reached him that, back in New Delhi, Nehru had died. Abdullah atonce \u2018broke into tears and sobbed\u2019. In a muffled voice he told the reporters",
  "gathered around him, \u2018he is dead, I can t meet him\u2019. When asked for more re-",
  "actions he retired to a room, to be alone with his grief.",
  "Abdullah drove down to Rawalpindi and got on the first flight to Delhi.",
  "When he reached Teen Murti and saw the body of Nehru, \u2018he cried like a",
  "child\u2019. It took him some time to \u2018compose himself and place the wreath on",
  "the body of his old friend and comrade\u2019. To this account of a newsman on the",
  "spot we must add the witness of a diplomat who accompanied Nehru\u2019s body",
  "to the cremation ground. As the fire was burning the body to ashes, buglers",

  "VIII",
  "The events of April\u2014May 1964 have unfortunately been neglected by schol-",
  "ars, whether biographers of Nehru or analysts of the Kashmir dispute.41 If I",

  "intractable of political problems \u2013 this \u2018severe headache\u2019 as Vallabhbhai Patel",

  "SheikhAbdullah\u2013andbecausetheyprovideapeculiarlypoignantcodatothe",
  "life and work of Jawaharlal Nehru.",
  "The question remains how serious were the three campaigners for peace",
  "in April\u2014May 1964? The one who did not reveal his mind at all, at least not",
  "in the public domain, was Field Marshal Ayub Khan. We know nothing about",
  "what he really thought at the time, whether he was indeed serious about a ne-",
  "gotiated settlement on Kashmir, and whether he could then, so to say, \u2018sell\u2019",
  "an agreement with India to his people. Sheikh Abdullah, on the other hand,",
  "wasforthcomingwithhisviews,expressingthemtothepressandincountless",
  "public meetings and orations. Some thought his words a mere mask for per-",
  "sonal ambition. Writing in the Economic Weekly, one commentator claimed",
  "that \u2018even a superficial study of his political behaviour convinces [one] that",
  "he is embarked on a most ramified plan to win an independent State by skil-",
  "fully exploiting the hates and the prejudices, conscious and unconscious, andthepowerpoliticaltangleswhichprovidethebackgroundtoIndo-Pakistanre-",
  "lations\u2019.42",
  "This seems to me to be too cynical by far. For Abdullah\u2019s words, and",
  "still more his actions, make manifest his commitment to secularism, his con-",
  "cernfortheminoritiesinbothIndiaandPakistan.Hewasambitious,certainly,",
  "but while in 1953 he seems to have fancied himself as the uncrowned king",
  "of Kashmir, in 1964 he saw himself rather as an exalted peacemaker, the one",
  "manwhocouldbringtranquillityandprosperitytoapooranddividedsubcon-",
  "tinent.",
  "About Jawaharlal Nehru\u2019s motives there should be no doubt at all. He",
  "felt guilty about Abdullah\u2019s long incarceration, worried about the continuing",
  "disaffection in Kashmir, sensible of the long-term costs of the dispute to both",
  "India and Pakistan. The question was not then ofhis motives, but ofhis influ-",
  "ence.Wouldhiscolleagueslistentohim?HadheandAyubKhan,withalittle",
  "help from Abdullah, actually worked out a settlement, would it have passed",
  "muster with the Congress Party, or the Indian Parliament?",
  "Possibly not. But even if it did, would it have worked in the long run?",
  "The legal expert consulted by Nehru\u2019s office on the idea of a confederation",
  "delicately pointed out that \u2018historically, confederations have been dominated",
  "by one member or united under stress\u2019.43 In sheer size India swamped both",
  "PakistanandKashmir.WoulditthenhavebehavedlikeBigBrother?Relevant",
  "here is a cartoon by Rajinder Puri that appeared in the Hindustan Times the",
  "day Abdullah met Ayub Khan. It showed the Field Marshal standing rumin-",
  "atively, finger on chin, with the Sheikh expansively gesticulating, and saying:",
  "\u2018You\u2019re afraid Delhi will try to dominate Pindi? My dear chap, when Delhi",
  "can t dominate Lucknow or Chandigarh. . .\u2019 .44",
  "Here then were a host of imponderables \u2013 Ayub\u2019s motives, Abdul-lah s",
  "beliefs, Nehru s strength, the viability of a condominium or a confederation.",
  "IntheenditwasNehru\u2019sstrengththatgaveway\u2013literally.And,asaPakistani",
  "newspaper noted, his passing away meant \u2018the end of a negotiated settlement",
  "of the Kashmir issue\u2019. For whoever succeeded Nehru would not have \u2019the",
