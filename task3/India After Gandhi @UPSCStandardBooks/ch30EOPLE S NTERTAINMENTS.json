  "when they are not working or fighting or raising a family?",
  "The short answer to this question is: most of them go to the movies.",
  "Feature films are the great popular passion of India, cutting across the social",
  "divides featured so heavily in this book \u2013 the divides of caste, class, region, re-",
  "ligion, gender and language.",
  "It was in the last week of 1895 that the Lumi\u00e8re brothers launched the",
  "first Cin\u00e9matograph in Paris. Soon, intrepid Indian photographers were shoot-",

  "of a legendary prince, Raja Harishchandra. Eighteen years later the first Indian",
  "sound feature appeared, Ardeshir Irani\u2019s Alam Ara.",
  "During the 1920s and 1930s Indian films had to compete with pictures",
  "madeinEuropeandNorthAmerica.ButaftertheendoftheSecondWorldWar",
  "the number of films made in India dramatically increased. In 1945, 99 feature",
  "films were produced; two years later, by the time of Independence, the number",
  "had jumped to 250, two-thirds of these made by first-time venture capitalists.1Someearly films tookupdevotional orromantic themes; otherswerein-",
  "fluencedbythesocialandpoliticalcurrentsofthetime.A1930sclassic,Ach-",
  "hut Kanya, was about the love of a Brahmin man for an Untouchable girl.",
  "The movies of the inter-war period were redolent with patriotic imagery,",
  "the love for the nation-in-the-making manifest in their dialogue and songs.",
  "Whilefilmdirectorsandactorswereinfluencedbythenationalmovement,the",
  "latter was supremely indifferent to them. The producer of Achhut Kanya was",
  "unable to get that lifelong crusader against Untouchability, Mahatma Gandhi,",
  "towatchhisfilm.(ApparentlytheonlyfilmGandhisaw\u2013andeventhatnotto",
  "its end \u2013 was a mythological story titled Ram Rajya.)2 Nor is there any record",
  "of Jawaharlal Nehru, Vallabhbhai Patel or many other early leaders visiting",
  "cinema theatres.",
  "Where some nationalists ignored the movies, others more actively pros-",
  "elytizedagainstthem.TherewasalwaysapuritanicalstreakintheIndianfree-",
  "dom movement, which was repelled by the colourful costumes, the love stor-",
  "ies and the song-and-dance routines of the popular film. After Independence",
  "some puritans assumed high office, from where they spoke out against an in-",
  "dustry they did not like. In September 1950 the chief minister of Rajasthan",
  "rued the \u2018baneful influence\u2019 of motion pictures, while admitting that he had",
  "seen only one film himself. Three years later the chief minister of Madras",
  "complained that the focus of films on sex and murder was corrupting India\u2019s",
  "youth. He urged film-makers to \u2018reduce the sex appeal in pictures\u2019, and think",
  "insteadof\u2018theproductionofPuranic[religious]picturesincolour\u2019.\u2018Howcan",
  "we progress in other matters if every young man is thinking of this [sex] stuff",
  "all the time?\u2019 he complained. He especially \u2018asked the poor wage-earners not",
  "to see cinemas, not because he disliked the cinema trade, but because he felt",
  "that they could find better use for the money. The rich could afford to go to",
  "pictures and ruin themselves.\u20193",
  "In truth, such sentiments were not restricted to the political class. In",
  "December 1952 a committee appointed by the Syndicate of the Calcutta",
  "University found that a major reason for the high failure-rate in examinations",
  "was that students spent too much time at the movies.4 Two years later a pe-",
  "tition was sent to the prime minister claiming that films threatened \u2018the mor-",
  "al health of the country\u2019; apparently, they were \u2018a major factor in incitement",
  "to crime and general unsettlement of society\u2019.5 The petition was signed by",
  "13,000housewives,whosecausewastakenupinParliamentbyLilavatiMun-",
  "shi, herself the wife of a well-known puritan politician named K. M. Mun-",
  "shi. Speaking in the Rajya Sabha in November 1954,Mrs Munshi argued that",
  "\u2018the cinema can make or mar the whole generation and the entire nation\u2019. Shethought the latter more likely, since (in her view) the celebration of crime and",
  "sex was encouraging young Indians to repeat these acts in real life. She was",
  "especially worried about \u2018the showing of the flesh of girls in an unseemly",
  "way to excite the crowds\u2019. She was answered in the House by the great actor",
  "PrithvirajKapoor,whoinsistedthatinafreesocietyartcouldnotbethrottled.",
  "From the artist\u2019s point of view, he added, \u2018sunshine and shadow went hand in",
  "hand\u2019.6",
  "To counter these objections a Censor Board was constituted, which saw",
  "everyfilmbeforegrantingitanapprovalcertificate.Scenesthatweresexually",
  "suggestive were prohibited, while films with scenes of violence were granted",
  "an \u2018adults-only\u2019 certificate. Withal, the industry grew at a terrific pace after",
  "Independence. By 1961 there were more than 300 films made annually, these",
  "shown in 4,500 theatres spread across the country. By 1990 the number of",
  "cinemas had doubled and the number of films made more than tripled.",
  "By the 1950s the city of Bombay had become the acknowledged centre",
  "of the Indian film industry. The most popular films were in Hindi, a language",
  "understoodacrossmuchofthecountry,buttherewerealsothrivingindustries",
  "in the other languages. In 1992, for example, while 189 films were made in",
  "Hindi, nearly as many (180) were made in Tamil, 153 in Telugu, 92 in Kan-",
  "nada, 90 in Malayalam, 42 in Bengali and 25 in Marathi.7",
  "By 1980 India had surpassed the United States as the country that made",
  "the most films in the world. Film going in India was now unarguably the",
  "most popular form of entertainment ever devised. In 1997, the fiftieth year of",
  "Independence, it was estimated that the daily cinema audience in India was12",
  "million \u2013 more than the population of many member-states of the United Na-",
  "tions.",
  "Thegrowthofthefilmindustryhashadanoticeableimpactonthephys-",
  "icallandscapeofurbanIndia.Cinemahallsdominatesmallertowncentres;in",
  "larger metropolises they are strung across the city locality by locality. Even",
  "more ubiquitous are the film posters, exhibited in vivid colours and various",
  "sizes, somesmall enoughtobestuckonthesideofawayside shop,othersgi-",
  "gantic billboards that tower above the road. Some 70,000 posters are printed",
  "for a big-budget film; pasted wherever a blank wall presents itself, these stay",
  "on in their faded glory well after the film itself has passed into history.8",
  "IIThe ingredients of the average Hindi film are well known; colour (East-",
  "man preferred); songs (six or seven) in voices one knows and trusts;",
  "dance \u2013 solo and ensemble \u2013 the more frenzied the better; bad girl, good",
  "girl, bad guy, goody guy, romance (but no kisses); tears, guffaws, fights,",
  "chases, melodrama; characters who exist in a social vacuum; dwellings",
  "which do not exist outside the studio floor; [exotic] locations in Kulu,",
  "Manali, Ooty, Kashmir, London, Paris, Hong Kong, Tokyo . . . See any",
  "three Hindi films, and two will have all the ingredients listed above.9",
  "So wrote the Indian filmmaker Satyajit Ray. Ray\u2019s own films had no dances",
  "and few songs. He took his viewers into the homes his characters lived in,",
  "showingtheclothestheyworeandthefoodtheyate.Theliveshisprotagonists",
  "led were utterly and compellingly real. Still, while his films have their (un-",
  "deniably elevated) place, thepopularIndianfilm hasitsplace, too.Raymight",
  "dismissthisasa\u2018synthetic,non-existentsociety\u2019,a\u2018make-believeworld\u2019.But",
  "it was precisely because the world they depicted was unreal that these films",
  "appealed. And those who made the most popular movies knew as much. A",
  "successful film director of the 1970s, Manmohan Desai, said of his work that",
  "\u2018I want people to forget their misery. I want to take them into a dream world",
  "where there is no poverty, where there are no beggars, where fate is kind and",
  "God is busy looking after hisflock.\u201910",
  "Peasants and workers in independent India went to the movies for the",
  "same reason as, back in the nineteenth century, a newly literate working class",
  "in Britain chose to read stories of the rich and the famous. As a character in a",
  "George Gissing novel remarks, \u2018nothing can induce workingmen and women",
  "to read stories that treat of their own world. They are the most consummate",
  "idealistsincreation,especiallythewomen...Theworkingclassesdetestany-",
  "thingthattriestorepresenttheirdailylife.\u201911Onlyfarceandmelodrama,wrote",
  "Gissing, went down well with the British working classes. Such is also the",
  "case in India where, however, farce and melodrama have been suitably indi-",
  "genized. Some recurrent themes make less sense outside the Indian context \u2013",
  "a son\u2019s devotion to his mother, for example, or a mother-in-law\u2019s contentious",
  "relationshipwithherdaughter-in-law,orthedifficulties(andglories)ofchoos-",
  "ing one\u2019s life partner in defiance of caste and family custom. Again, in the",
  "Indianfilmthe\u2018badguy\u2019andthe\u2018badgirl\u2019playmorecentralrolesthaninthe",
  "typical Hollywood melodrama \u2013 these are the villain and the vamp, malevol-",
  "ent characters in opposition to whom the hero and heroine appear purer than",
  "one would have thought humanly possible.12A celebrated film director once described his productions as \u2018pageants",
  "for peasants\u2019.13 These pageants, naturally, were set in locations the peasants",
  "could only dream of. Sometimes this was a mythic past, where men flew on",
  "horses and conversed with gods; at other times, in places on earth that the",
  "viewers would never get to. Indian films were \u2013 and are \u2013 shot on the French",
  "Riviera, in the Swiss Alps, on the South African coast, with its characters",
  "wearing clothes not worn in India and driving cars never seen there. This",
  "was a \u2018wholly voyeuristic cinema, where the object of desire could be any-",
  "thing from Dutch tulips to fancy telephone instruments\u2019, and through which",
  "the viewer \u2018lived at second hand a lifestyle lived Elsewhere\u2019.14",
  "Where the Indian film rises above stock themes and stereotypes, and be-",
  "comes truly original, is in its music. Traditional Indian plays and dramas all",
  "had songs of one sort or another. This method was carried over to the cinema,",
  "whereeachfilmincludesabouthalfadozensongs,sungoffscreenbyavoice",
  "not the actor\u2019s, who merely lip-synchs the sung words.",
  "In a historic accident, or perhaps an accident made possible only by his-",
  "tory, these songs of love and despair came to be written by some of the finest",
  "poets of the age. At the time of Independence, and for perhaps a century",
  "before that, the pre-eminent language of poetry was Urdu. Before and after",
  "Partition, many Muslim writers \u2013 and not a few Hindus \u2013 found refuge in",
  "the Bombay film industry. Their noms de plume \u2013 Sultanpuri, Jaipuri, Ludhi-",
  "anvi,Azmi,Badayuni,Bhopali\u2013evokedthetownsofnorthIndiawhereUrdu",
  "had flowered, as a syncretic language spoken with an exquisite refinement by",
  "Muslims and Hindus alike.",
  "One reason that film songs were so popular was because of their lyrics.",
  "Theseweredelicatelyworded,richinpunsandhistoricalorpoliticalallusion.",
  "And they were set to music that was no less appealing. The melodies drew",
  "from classical music and folk songs, but their orchestration also borrowed",
  "heavily - and for the most part, innovatively \u2013 from Western exemplars. The",
  "sitar and the tabla mixed more or less harmoniously with the saxophone and",
  "violin. \u2018Long before fusion music became fashionable\u2019, wrote one student of",

  "whole set to the strict structure of a classical Hindustani raga.15",
  "Traditionalists dismissed the film song as \u2018a degraded \u2013 even degenerate",
  "\u2013 form of Indian classical or folk genres\u2019. But, as Ashraf Aziz points out, this",
  "wasneitherfolknorclassical,but\u2018anewgenreofsongobligatorilycreatedfor",

  "the songs of the films were \u2018on the tongues of high society ladies of Calcutta",
  "as well as the tongawallahs of Peshawar\u2019.17",
  "Indian audiences, writes the film historian Nasreen Munni Kabir, are",
  "\u2018resigned to stock characters and predictable dialogue\u2019. But they know, and",

  "III",
  "From the 1940s to the 1980s films were watched by two kinds of Indians -",
  "young men in all-male groups, and families. An anthropologist working in",
  "northern India found that \u2018many unmarried men are intensive users of film",
  "culture\u2019. They liked films in themselves, for the entertainment they provided",
  "and for offering them an escape from the trials of family living. The theatre",
  "wasaplace where theycouldsmoke cigarettes (prohibited athome),andjoke",
  "andplayaroundwiththeir friends.Althoughyoungwomenrarely wenttothe",
  "movies, older men sometimes took along their wives and parents. The two",
  "groups tended to prefer different kinds of films. Young men liked those with",
  "\u2018unrestrained dance and fight scenes\u2019, whereas mixed groups chose to watch",
  "films depicting the joys and troubles of family life.19",
  "The passion for films was even more intense in south India. Here, male",
  "moviegoers had constituted themselves into fan clubs, each devoted to cel-",
  "ebrating a particular male star. The town of Madurai in Tamil Nadu, for ex-",
  "ample, had as many as 500 such clubs, whose members were mostly in their",
  "late teens orearly twenties. Theyincluded tailors, rickshaw pullers, vegetable",
  "sellers and students. The club\u2019s activities were aimed at promoting their star,",
  "by pasting posters of his films, buying tickets to watch them and generally",
  "singing his praises in public and in private. Occasionally, the club\u2019s activities",
  "tookamorephilanthropicturn,bydonatingbloodinthehero\u2019snameorraising",
  "money for disaster relief.20",
  "InearlierchapterswehavemetM.G.RamachandranofTamilNaduand",
  "N. T. Rama Rao of Andhra Pradesh, movie stars who became chief ministers",
  "of their state on the strength of their acting career alone. As adored in his nat-",
  "ive heath was the Kannada film actor Rajkumar, although he did not seek toconvertthisadorationintopoliticaladvantage.Inallcases,thevenerationwas",
  "a consequence of the fact that, in this part of India, film was a prime vehicle",
  "forthearticulationoflinguisticnationalism.Thepeopleofthesouthsawtheir",
  "languages under threat from Hindi; mobilizing to protect it, they sought hope",
  "and support from the actors who spoke most eloquently their own beloved",

  "ence \u2013 life and death, romance and betrayal, prosperity and misery \u2013 and did",
  "so in phrases and idioms drawn from the rhythms and cadences of everyday",
  "speech. Literally as well as metaphorically, NTR and his fans, MGR and his",
  "fans, and Rajkumar and his fans spoke the same language.",
  "In the Hindi heartland, the love of films was not so closely tied in with",
  "one\u2019s social identity. (As it was spoken by more Indians than any other lan-",
  "guage, Hindi was scarcely seen as being under threat.) Still, because their",
  "catchment was bigger, the Hindi stars could command a wider \u2013 though not",
  "necessarily deeper \u2013 appreciation. Arguably the most popular film star of all",
  "time is the Hindi actor Amitabh Bachchan. (I speak here not merely of India",
  "but of the world as a whole \u2013 Bachchan was voted as such in an online poll",
  "conducted by the British Broadcasting Corporation in 2001.)",
  "Born in 1942, the son of a famous Hindi poet of Allahabad, Amitabh",
  "Bachchan joined films after a stint in the corporate world. He was very tall",
  "andfairlydark,inbothrespectsatoddswiththepopularheroeswhopreceded",
  "him. These handicaps were soon overcome by his imperious manner and his",
  "magnificent deep voice. Bachchan rose to stardom in the early 1970s \u2013 a time",
  "of great cynicism with regard to the political system, which was being chal-",
  "lenged by such extra-parliamentary forces as the Naxalites and Jayaprakash",
  "Narayan\u2019s Bihar movement. His roles were in keeping with the times. He",
  "playedtheangryyoungman,pittedagainstbutalwaysovercomingthesystem",
  "\u2013 as a militant worker against unfeeling capitalists, an honest police officer",
  "against corrupt superiors, even as an underworld don whose wicked manner",
  "hid (not very successfully) a golden heart.21",
  "In 1982 Bachchan was hospitalized after an accident suffered on the set.",
  "Millions prayed, successfully, for his recovery. Three years later he became a",
  "Congress MP from Allahabad, at the invitation of his childhood friend Rajiv",
  "Gandhi. \u2018Who will replace the angry young man?\u2019 asked the popular press",
  "plaintively.22 Fortunately, he and Rajiv Gandhi then fell out, with Bachchan",
  "leaving Parliament to return to the screen. As he has grown older, his roles",
  "have changed. He is astonishingly versatile \u2013 in his sixties, he can play the",
  "stern father as well as the quirky policeman (as in Bunty and Babli, 2005). In",
  "the first years of the new millennium he took on his most popular role yet, asthe host of Kaun Banega Crorepati, the Indian version of Who Wants to Be a",
  "Millionaire? The show was spectacularly successful, in part because it was in",
  "tunewiththeget-rich-quicktemperamentofpost-liberalizationIndia,butalso",
  "because of the fame and personality of the host. Bachchan was brilliant \u2013 by",
  "turns gentle and sharp, and superbly bilingual, his improvisations worthy of",
  "his father, a Hindi poet who was also a professor of English literature.",
  "Asixtieth-birthday tribute toBachchan spokeofhowhiscareer had\u2018tra-",

  "that successfully is the singer Lata Mangeshkar. She too had a gifted father,",
  "the singer, actor and composer Dinanath Mangeshkar. He diedin 1942, when",
  "Latawasonlythirteenbuthavingspentthebetterpartofherlifelearningmu-",
  "sic from her father. As the eldest of five siblings, Lata very quickly became",
  "the family\u2019s main breadwinner. She sang at first in Marathi films, but soon",
  "moved to the more popular and better-paying Hindi arena.",
  "Lata Mangeshkar\u2019sfirstsongasaplayback singerwasrecordedin1947.",

  "than 5,000 songs.24",
  "Before Lata Mangeshkar, most women singers in films possessed husky",
  "voices. Lata\u2019s veered towards the higher end of the scale. Shrill to some, her",
  "singing was to others the very embodiment of soft femininity. It soon became",
  "the best-known voice in India, the \u2018voice to which the road-side vendor in",
  "Delhi has transacted his business, the long-distance trucker has sped along",
  "the highway, the Army jawan in Ladakh has kept guard at his frontier bunker",
  "and to which the glittering elite have dined in luxury hotels\u2019.25 Her appeal cut",
  "across both class and political orientation. The nationalist Jawaharlal Nehru",

  "IV",
  "Onefeatureofthefilmindustryhasbeenitscapaciouscosmopolitanism.Parsi",
  "andJewishactorshaverubbedshoulderswithHindusandMuslimsandChris-tians. Some of the greatest film directors have been from Bengal or south In-",
  "dia.",
  "A very representative example is one of the most successful films ever",
  "made, Sholay (1975). Its director was a Sindhi, while its lyricist and one male",
  "lead were Punjabi. Other male leads were from Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat and",
  "North-West Frontier Province respectively. (Another, who was dropped at the",
  "last moment, was from Sikkim.) Of the two female leads, one was a Tamil,",
  "the other a Bengali domiciled in Madhya Pradesh. The music director was a",
  "Bengali \u2013 from Tripura.26",
  "It was not just in Bombay that the film industry was socially inclusive.",
  "In the Madras studios of the Tamil director S. S. Vasan the \u2018make-up depart-",
  "ment was first headed by a Bengali who became too big for a studio and then",
  "left. He was succeeded by a Maharashtrian who was assisted by a Dharwar",
  "Kannadiga,anAndhra,aMadrasIndianChristian,anAnglo-Burmeseandthe",
  "usuallocalTamils.\u2019AsoneofVasan\u2019sscriptwriterswastorecall,\u2018thisgangof",
  "nationally integrated make-up men could turn any decent-looking person into",
  "a hideous crimson-hued monster with the help of truck-loads of pancake and",
  "a number of other locally made potions and lotions.\u201927",
  "Above all, the film industry provided generous refuge for India\u2019s largest",
  "and often very vulnerable minority, the Muslims. Many of the best lyricists,",
  "as already noted, were Muslim; so were some popular scriptwriters. Some of",
  "the best male singers were Muslim. So too were some top directors and, even",
  "morestrikingly,sometopactors.When,shortlyafterIndia\u2019sfirstgeneralelec-",
  "tion, a Bombay magazine asked its readers to choose their favourite actor, a",
  "Muslim man polled the most votes, a Muslim woman the second most.28 In-",
  "terestingly, both had assumed non-Muslim names \u2013 Yusuf Khan becoming",
  "theHindu-soundingDilipKumarandFatimaRashidtakingtheneutralpseud-",
  "onym Nargis (after the Narcissus flower). As Muslim actors and actresses be-",
  "came more established, they no longer needed to resort to such subterfuge. A",
  "great star of the 1950s and 1960s was the actress Waheeda Rahman. Much",
  "later, in the 1990s, the top male stars in Hindi films were three Muslims with",
  "a common surname, Khan.",
  "The novelist Mukul Kesavan writes of his Delhi childhood that in his",
  "school and home he never came across a Muslim name. Then he adds, \u2018The",
  "only place youwere sure ofmeeting Muslims was the movies.\u201929 Notably,the",
  "content of the movies also reflected their presence and contribution. Because",
  "so many scriptwriters and lyricists were Muslim, the language of the Bom-",
  "bay film \u2013 spoken or sung \u2013 was quite dissimilar to the stiff, formal, Sanskrit-",
  "ized Hindi promoted by the state in independent India. Rather, it was closertothecolloquialHindustanithatthesewritersspoke,alanguagesuffusedwith",
  "UrduwordsandwidelyunderstoodacrosstheIndianheartland.30Again,while",
  "most films featured Muslim characters, these were \u2018rarely shown in an unfa-",
  "vourablelight.Theywerehonestfriends,loyalsoldiers,goodpolicemen,bluff",
  "Pathans,friendlyuncles.\u201931Thereremainedonesignificanttaboo\u2013againstro-",
  "mantic relationships between Hindus and Muslims. This taboo was partially",
  "breached by the 1995 hit film Bombay, which showed a Hindu boy falling in",
  "love with a Muslim girl. However, the reverse was not conceivable: no film",
  "could go so much against the grain as to show a Muslim man marrying a",
  "Hindu girl.",
  "In the world of Indian film Muslims have occupied an honourable place.",
  "The leading Malayalam film actor Maamooty remarks that \u2018I have been in",
  "this business for the last two decades and a half and I don\u2019t remember even a",
  "single occasion in which my Muslim identity stood in my way.\u201932 Would that",
  "we could say the same about other spheres of life in independent India.",
  "V",
  "For \u2018an Indian world full of strife, tension and misery\u2019, writes one critic, the",
  "popular film provided \u2018just the right escapism the country needed\u2019.33 While",
  "most films took their viewers into a fantasy world, there was also a signific-",
  "ant strain of realism. In the first years of Independence, three filmmakers in",
  "particular(partially)buckedthepopulisttrend.ThesewereBimalRoy,whose",
  "Do Bigha Zamin (1953) sensitively portrayed the sufferings of the rural poor;",
  "Mehboob Khan, whose Mother India (1957) interwove the story of a heroic",
  "mother with the story of a new nation coming into its own; and Guru Dutt,",
  "whoinaseries ofremarkable films explored the darker side oflife, asexperi-",
  "enced especially by artists shunned by a crassly materialistic society.",
  "The pre-eminent representative of an \u2018alternative\u2019 tradition of film mak-",
  "ing in India, however, was the Bengali giant Satyajit Ray (1921\u201392). The son",
  "and grandson of writers, Ray himself was very variously gifted. An accom-",
  "plished short-story writer in Bengali, he was knowledgeable about classical",
  "music(WesternandIndian),andformanyyearsmadealivingasanartistand",
  "designer. His debut film, Pather Panchali, released in 1955, was the first of",
  "a trilogy that followed a boy named Apu from childhood into manhood, in",
  "the process delineating, with great sensitivity and skill, social changes in the",
  "Bengal countryside. Over the next three decades he made virtually a film ayear,thesewithoneexceptionallsetinBengal.Severalwerebasedonnovels",
  "by Rabindranath Tagore, by whose scepticism regarding nationalism and aes-",
  "thetic sensibility Ray was deeply influenced. He received an Oscar for \u2018life-",

  "in newspapers and magazines and in trains and buses as well. He was also",
  "greatly admired abroad; his films were regularly shown at Cannes and other",
  "festivals and his work was handsomely praised by Akira Kurosawa and other",
  "peers. Within India, however, he could attract criticism, as when the actress",
  "Nargis alleged in Parliament that he show cased Indian poverty to attract at-",
  "tention in the West. The charge was petty, not to say petulant; it was probably",
  "provoked by Ray\u2019s own less-than-flattering remarks about the Hindi film.",
  "Among Ray\u2019s distinguished contemporaries were two fellow Bengalis \u2013",
  "Ritwik Ghatak (1925\u201376) and Mrinal Sen (born 1923). Both were influen-",
  "ced by the state\u2019s communist movement, and their films were often sharply",
  "political, dealing with such themes as peasant protest, Partition and the great",
  "Bengal Famine of 1943. The leading radical film makers of the next gen-",
  "eration were Shyam Benegal (born 1934) and A door Gopalakrishnan (born",

  "Outside of the cinema, Indians have also taken succour in various forms of",
  "\u2018live\u2019 entertainment. One such is theatre. The subcontinent was home to a",
  "rich tradition of classical Sanskrit drama; besides, each region had its own",
  "form of folk theatre, where dialogue was usually interspersed With song and",
  "dance. Known as jatra in Bengal, natya in Maharashtra, and Yakshagana in",
  "Karnataka, these folk forms skilfully adapted to the modern world. The cos-",
  "tumes remained traditional, but the themes of the plays now squarely ad-",
  "dressed the debates of the time \u2013 whether women\u2019s liberation, the reform of",
  "caste or the conflict between economic development and environmental sus-",
  "tainability.",
  "The creation of linguistic states gave a fresh fillip to regional theatre.",
  "They now had a \u2018captive\u2019 audience, so to speak, thirty or forty million speak-",
  "ers of the language in which the plays were performed. New groups and",
  "movements took shape, working within the ambit of the linguistic state but",
  "with an eye open to the wider world.",
  "Among these groups was Ninasam, established in 1949 by an areca nut",
  "farmernamedK.V.SubannainhisnativevillageinnorthKarnataka.Subanna",
  "studied at the University of Mysore, where he was inspired by his teacher,",
  "the poet Kuvempu (K. V. Puttappa), to combine a life of farming with that",
  "of artistic creation. On returning home to Heggodu, he first started a theatre",
  "group, followed, in time, by a newspaper, a publishing house, a film club, a",
  "drama school and a full-fledged repertory company.",
  "Fifty years after it started, Ninasam is thriving, run now by Subanna\u2019s",
  "sonK.V.Akshara,himselfagraduateoftheNationalSchoolofDramaandof",
  "Leeds University. Ninasam organizes \u2018culture camps\u2019 in which peasants and",
  "artisans interact with distinguished scholars from all over the world. But their",
  "main activity remains the theatre. Ninasam runs a full-fledged drama school,",
  "many of whose graduates then join their travelling repertory.",
  "Every year, during the annual culture camp in Heggodu, three plays are",
  "premieredatanauditoriumnamedfortheKannadawriterandpolymathShiv-",
  "arama Karanth. The playsare all performed in the local language; one is usu-",

  "onsuccessivedays,thevillageaudiencemightseeplaysby,forexample,Gir-",
  "ish Karnad, Mohan Rakesh and Anton Chekhov. These treats are not restric-",
  "ted to Heggodu; after being premiered there, the plays are thentaken by the",
  "Ninasam repertory to different towns and villages in the state.36",
  "In an average year the repertory performs around 150 plays before audi-",
  "ences totalling some 300,000 people, the bulk of which are rural and small-",
  "town folk. And \u2018so you found farmers who grew areca, rice and sugarcane",
  "in daytime turn themselves into connoisseurs of Sophocles, Shakespeare,",
  "Moli\u00e8re and Ibsen at night\u2019.37",
  "Another innovator who has successfully blended folk with classical",
  "forms is the director Habib Tanvir. A product of the radical Indian People\u2019s",
  "Theatre Association of the 1940s, Tanvir later studied at the Royal Academy",
  "of Dramatic Arts in London before returning home to his native Chattisgarh.",
  "There he worked with local singers and actors to create a series of superb",
  "plays in which song and dance were used to satirize the petty corruptions of",
  "thevillageeliteandthemorebrutalcorruptionsofthestate.Hisrepertorycon-",
  "sisted chiefly of local actors, who spoke in the local dialect. Yet their skill al-",

  "garh itself.38",
  "Subanna might be described as a \u2018progressive\u2019; Tanvir, as an \u2018activist\u2019.",
  "Neither explicitly aligned himself with a political party or movement. Other",
  "theatre groups have been more directly propagandist. They include the Jana",
  "Natya Mandali, which is closely identified with the Naxalite movement in",
  "Andhra Pradesh. The Mandali\u2019s star performer is the folk singer Gaddar, a",
  "sometime engineering student from a Dalit home who has been active in left-",
  "wing politics for more than thirty years. In 1971 he composed a song about",
  "the rickshaw pullers of Hyderabad; since then, he has composed and sung",
  "many songs celebrating the stoicism of the poor or the savaging of their op-",
  "pressors.Thesesongsmakeofferingstothevictimsofpolicebrutality,orcon-",
  "trast the hard labour of the peasant with the opulent lifestyle of the proper-",
  "tied class. In his songs, says Gaddar, \u2018life is people, people\u2019s suffering, [and]",
  "their tunes\u2019. Often underground, sometimes in jail, detested by the police but",
  "revered by the peasantry, Gaddar is a near-legendary figure, and not just in",
  "Andhra Pradesh. When he gave a concert in Bangalore, for example, some",
  "20,000 people attended.39VII",
  "The most sophisticated form of entertainment in modern India is classical",
  "music, this performed and heard in two major styles, the Hindustani and the",
  "Carnatic. Traditionally, classical music flourished in courts and temples, pat-",
  "ronized by Maharajas and Nawabs. During British rule, the princes continued",
  "tomaintainmusiciansintheircourts,butsecularpatronsalsobegantoemerge",

  "By the time of Independence Ravi Shankar was well established as a",
  "concert artist. He usually played solo, but with Ali Akbar Khan also popular-",

  "purelyclassicalform.ThusRaviShankarcreatedaballetbasedonJawaharlal",
  "Nehru\u2019s Discovery of India, and also composed music for several films made",

  "In 1956 Ravi Shankar went on the first of what were to become annual",
  "overseas tours. Of a concert he gave in New York in 1961, the city\u2019s newspa-",
  "per of record wrote that it \u2018created a whole new aural landscape\u2019, one \u2018evoc-",

  "now Ravi Shankar had begun playing with Western musicians \u2013 John Col-",
  "trane, Yehudi Menuhin, Andre Previn, and the like \u2013 and also recording discs",
  "with them. His fame dramatically increased after the Beatle George Harrison",
  "took lessons with him, and began to refer to him as his \u2018guru\u2019.",
  "In 1967 Ravi Shankar shifted his base to California. He became a hippie",
  "icon, a regular presence at music festivals at Monterey and elsewhere, and",

  "VIII",
  "The form of entertainment most typical of urban-industrial society is, of",
  "course, spectator sport. All modern sports are played and watched in India,",
  "along with traditional games such as kho-kho and kabaddi. In terms of",
  "achievement,twosportsstandout:billiards,inwhichIndiahasproducedsev-",
  "eral world champions, and field hockey, in which the Indian team was un-",
  "defeated in the Olympic Games between 1928 and 1956, winning six gold",
  "medals in succession.",
  "In terms of viewership, the two main sports are soccer and cricket. As in",
  "the West, soccer has been very popular among the working classes. The great",
  "industrial centres \u2013 Bombay, Delhi and Bangalore \u2013 all have active leagues,",
  "played between clubs several of which are sponsored by industrial houses.",
  "Thegameisalsowidelyfollowed,andactivelyplayed,inGoa,Keralaandthe",
  "Punjab.",
  "The capital city of Indian soccer, however, is Calcutta. Here, sporting",
  "rivalryhasgonehand-in-handwithpoliticalcompetition.Therearethreelead-",
  "ing teams: Mohammedan Sporting, traditionally representing the Muslims;",
  "Mohun Bagan, founded and supported by the Bengali bhadralok or upper",
  "classes;andEastBengal,theclubfavouredbythemoreplebeianclassesfrom",
  "the other side of the province. These and other teams play each other on the",
  "Calcutta Maidan, the vast expanse of turf that lies at the heart of the city.",
  "Fromthe1930stotheearly1980ssoccerwasprobablythemostpassion-",
  "ately discussed topic in Calcutta, even more so than politics or religion. The",
  "leading clubs each had thousands of followers, whose emotional investment",
  "in their team fully equalled that of European football fans. Violence during or",
  "after matches was not uncommon. However, after the 1982 World Cup popu-",
  "lar interest in the sport began to wane. This was the first World Cup telecast",
  "live in India; alerted to the gap between their own local heroes and the great",
  "international stars, men in Calcutta began to turn away from their clubs. Theslide has continued; twenty years later, soccer ranks a poor second to cricket",
  "among the sporting passions of Bengal.",
  "As it does in the rest of India as well. Cricket is a game that privileges",
  "wrist-work rather than size or physical fitness; to be small and stocky is not",
  "always a disadvantage. Thus, Indians can compete with the best in the world.",
  "Its slow pace and interrupted structure of play also suits Indians, encouraging",
  "them to go in groups to matches, there to engage in chatter and banter among",
  "themselves and with the players.",
  "In 1983 India won cricket\u2019s World Cup. The victory coincided with",
  "the spread of satellite television, which took the game to small towns and",
  "working-class homes. Through the 1980s and beyond cricket steadily gained",
  "inpopularity.TwoIndians,SunilGavaskarandSachinTendulkar,brokeworld",

  "In the aftermath of the Babri Masjid demolition, the Kargil war and the",

  "more intensely fought, not just by the players but equally in the minds of",
  "thosewhofollowedandsupportedthem.ThetelevisionaudienceforanIndia-",
  "Pakistanmatchwasintheorderof300million,formostofwhomthiswas,as",

  "the World Cup of 2003, for example, the residents of Bangalore poured out",
  "into the streets, \u2018bursting firecrackers, whooping, whistling, cheering aloud",
  "with the shouts of Bharat mataki jai [Glory to Mother India] renting the air\u2019.",
  "In Ahmedabad, however, the victory celebration turned into a communal riot",
  "after revellers accused some Muslim students of celebrating the fall of an In-",
  "dian wicket.44The next year, cricket figured in a curious way in the general election.",
  "At the time of the campaign the Indian team was playing, and winning, in",
  "Pakistan, where one of its leading players was Mohammed Kaif, a Muslim",
  "fromthestateofUttarPradesh.Returningseventy-nineMPstotheLokSabha,",

  "give enlightenment and elevation of spirit to the villagers\u2019.46 Most stations",
  "began broadcasting at dawn, with a hymn of invocation, ending at midnight",
  "with a weather report. The programmes interspersed music \u2013 classical, film",
  "and folk \u2013 with stories, plays, news bulletins and special shows for women,",
  "childrenandrurallisteners.Educationinhealthandfarmingmethodswasalso",
  "provided. It was a very mixed brew, allowing listeners to pick and choose ac-",
  "cording to their tastes and needs.",
  "In the year of Independence, 1947, the Indian radio industry manufac-",
  "tured a mere 3,000 sets. The number went up to 60,000 in 1951, and to150,000 in 1956. By 1962 All-India Radio was broadcasting from over thirty",
  "stations with a combined output of about 100,000 hours annually. A decade",
  "latertherewereanestimated15millionradiosetsinoperation;manyofthese,",
  "of course, listened to by more than one person.47",
  "Fora decade after Independence the Union minister in charge ofinform-",
  "ation and broadcasting was Dr B. V. Keskar, a scholar with a deep interest in",
  "classical Indian culture combined with a lofty disdain for its modern variants.",
  "In a speech in 1953 he noted that",
  "Classical music has fallen on bad days and is on the point of extinction",
  "in North India. Classical music has lost touch with the masses, not due",
  "to the fault of the public, but because of historical circumstances. In the",
  "past, it was patronized by Princes and Sardars, but that support has al-",
  "most ended. During the last 150 years we were under the British who",
  "would not understand and support Hindustani music . . . The main prob-",
  "lembeforemusiciansandAllIndiaRadioistorevivepubliccontactwith",
  "classical music. We must make them familiar with our traditional music,",
  "and make them more intimate with it.48",
  "Already, from the late 1930s, All-India Radio had begun employing classical",
  "musicians on its staff. The artists were ranked in various grades according to",
  "their age, ability and experience. They were assigned to the station nearest",
  "their home and expected to advise on programming as well as give regular",
  "recitals. By the late 1950s as many as 10,000 musicians were on the state\u2019s",
  "payroll.TheywerefromboththeHindustaniandCarnaticstyles,andincluded",
  "some of the greatest artists then living, among them Ali Akbar Khan, Bismil-",
  "lah Khan, Mallikarjun Mansur and Emmani Shankar Sastri.",
  "Most stations on All-India Radio played several hours of classical music",
  "a day. Saturday night featured the prestigious \u2018National Programme\u2019, when a",
  "single artist played or sang for a full ninety minutes. Every year the AIR or-",
  "ganized a Radio Sangeet Sammelan, a festival of live concerts held in towns",
  "and cities across India, whose recordings provided material for a month-long",
  "celebration of Indian music over the radio.",
  "Along with his love of the classical genres, Dr B. V. Keskar also had a",
  "particular distaste for films and film music. For the first few years of his ten-",
  "ure, popular music was banned on the airwaves. Fortunately, better sense pre-",
  "vailed and AIR launced a new station, Vividh Bharati, devoted exclusively tofilm music. The broadcasts soon found their way into millions of homes and",
  "attracted commercial advertisements that made the station self-supporting.49",
  "Without All-India Radio, Indian classical music might nothave survived",
  "the death of the princely order. But AIR also played a wider role in national",
  "integration, by linking popular culture with high culture, and region with na-",

  "From the early 1970s television began supplementing radio as a major",
  "source of entertainment (as well as propaganda). It was the latter objective",
  "which at first predominated, with programming on the state-owned Doordar-",

  "to grow more food and forge more steel. By the 1980s the channel had dis-",

  "millions of viewers as well as millions of rupees in advertising. These were",
  "followed by soap operas which followed the saga of a family over fifty or",
  "more episodes. (An early success was Ramesh Sippy\u2019s Buniyaad, which told",
  "the tale of a family from Lahore making a new life in India after Partition.)",

  "formed a memorable partnership with Nargis, a gorgeous beauty with whom",
  "he starred on seventeen occasions. When the duo showed up at a premier",

  "Less surprising has been the popularity of Hindi films in countries that",
  "share the same broad culture. An American tourist in Pakistan found that inboth public buses and private homes, the music that was most likely to be",

  "Another international success was the composer A. R. Rahman. A child",

  "over the popular imagination. In the larger context of world history, however,",
  "what is important is not why the voters voted as they did but the fact that",
  "they voted at all. Ever since the 1952 elections were described as the \u2018biggest",

  "was in excess of 60 per cent. Besides, as surveys showed, they increasingly",
  "exercised their choice independently, that is regardless of their husband\u2019s or",
  "father\u2019s views on the matter. Also voting in ever higher numbers were Dal-",
  "its and tribals, the oppressed and marginalized sections of society. In northern",
  "India in particular, Dalits turned out in far greater numbers than high castes.",
  "As the political analyst Yogendra Yadav points out, \u2018India is perhaps the only",
  "large democracy in the world today where the turnout of the lower orders is",
  "well above that of the most privileged groups.\u20193",

  "an exercise in bourgeois hypocrisy, the Maoists have been known to blacken",
  "the faces of villagers campaigning for political parties, and to warn potential",

  "where in 400 years of Portuguese rule the Goans had never been allowed to",

  "has tellingly compared India\u2019s treatment of Goa with Indonesia\u2019s treatment of",
  "East Timor, that other Portuguese colony \u2018liberated\u2019 by armed nationalists:",
  "Nehru had sent his troops to Goa in 1960 [sic] without a drop of blood",
  "being spilt. But he was a humane man and the freely elected leader of",
  "a democracy; he gave the Goanese their own autonomous state govern-",
  "ment, and encouraged their full participation in India\u2019s politics. In every",
  "respect, General Suharto was Nehru\u2019s polar opposite.9",
  "Considering the size of the electorate, it is overwhelmingly likely that more",
  "people have voted in Indian elections than voters in any other democracy. In-",
  "dia\u2019s success in this regard is especially striking when compared with the re-",
  "cord of its great Asian neighbour, China. That country is larger, but far less",
  "divided on ethnic or religious lines, and far less poor as well. Yet there has",

  "India/China comparisons have long been a staple of scholarly analysis.",
  "Now, in a world that becomes more connected by the day, they have become",
  "ubiquitous in popular discourse as well. In this comparison China might win",
  "on economic grounds but will lose on political ones. Indians like to harp on",
  "about their neighbour\u2019s democracy deficit, sometimes directly and at other",
  "times by euphemistic allusion. When asked to put on a special show at the",
  "World Economic Forum of 2006, the Indian delegation never failed to de-scribe their land, whether in speech or in print or on posters, as the \u2018World\u2019s",

  "been a certain unifying factor, a glue holding the members of the nation to-",

  "territory,acommonenemy\u2013andsometimesalloftheabove.Thus,theBritish",
  "nation brought together those who huddled together on a cold island, who",

  "Czechs, the Lithuanians etc. \u2013 their populations have been united by a com-",
  "mon language, a mostly common faith and a shared and very bitter history of",
  "domination by German and Russian oppressors.12",
  "By contrast with these (and other examples) the Indian nation does not",
  "privilege a single language or religious faith. Although the majority of its cit-",
  "izens are Hindus, India is not a \u2018Hindu\u2019 nation. Its constitution does not dis-",
  "criminate between people on the basis of faith; nor, more crucially, did the",
  "nationalist movement that lay behind it. From its inception the Indian Nation-",
  "al Congress was, as Mukul Kesavan observes, a sort of political Noah\u2019s Ark",
  "which sought to keep every species of Indian on board.13 Gandhi\u2019s politic-",
  "al programme was built upon harmony and co-operation between India\u2019s two",
  "major religious communities, Hindus and Muslims. Although, in the end, hiswork and example were unsuccessful in stopping the division of India, the",
  "failure made his successors even more determined to construct independent",
  "India as a secular republic. For Jawaharlal Nehru and his colleagues, if India",
  "was anything at all it was not a \u2018Hindu Pakistan\u2019.",
  "Like Indian democracy, Indian secularism is also a story that combines",
  "success with failure. Membership of a minority religion is no bar to advance-",

  "minorities appear to retain faith in the democratic and secular ideal. Very few",
  "Indian Muslims have joined terrorist or fundamentalist organizations. Even",
  "more than their compatriots, Indian Muslims feel that their opinion and vote",
  "matter. One recent survey found that while 69 per cent of all Indians approve",

  "Nurturing secularism in a land recently divided was going to be even harder.",
  "The creation of an Islamic state on India\u2019s borders was a provocation to those",

  "The pluralism of religion was one cornerstone of the foundation of the",
  "Indian republic. A second was the pluralism of language. Here again, the in-",
  "tention and the effort well pre-dated Independence. In the 1920s Gandhi re-",
  "constituted the provincial committees of the Congress on linguistic lines. The",
  "party had promised to form linguistic provinces as soon as the country was",
  "free. The promise wasnotredeemed immediately after 1947,because the cre-",
  "ationofPakistanhadpromotedfearsoffurtherBalkanization.However,inthe",
  "face of popular protest the government yielded to the demand.Linguistic states have been in existence for fifty years now. In that time",
  "they have deepened and consolidated Indian unity. Within each state a com-",
  "mon language has provided the basis of administrative unity and efficiency.",
  "It has also led to an efflorescence of cultural creativity, as expressed in film,",
  "theatre,fictionandpoetry.However,prideinone\u2019slanguagehasrarelybeenin",

  "jor secessionist movements in independent India \u2013 in Nagaland in the 1950s,",
  "in Punjab in the 1980s and in Kashmir in the 1990s \u2013 have affirmed reli-",
  "gious and territorial distinctiveness, not a linguistic one. For the rest, it has",
  "proved perfectly possible \u2013 indeed, desirable \u2013 to be Kannadiga and Indian,",
  "Malayali and Indian, Andhra and Indian, Tamil and Indian, Bengali and Indi-",
  "an, Oriya and Indian, Maharashtrian and Indian, Gujarati and Indian and, of",
  "course, Hindi-speaking and Indian.",
  "That, in India, unity and pluralism are inseparable is graphically ex-",
  "pressed in the country\u2019s currency notes. On one side is printed a portrait of",
  "the \u2018father of the nation\u2019, Mahatma Gandhi; on the other side apicture of the",
  "HousesofParliament. Thenote\u2019sdenomination \u20135,10,50,100etc. \u2013isprin-",
  "ted in words in Hindi and English (the two official languages), but also, in",
  "smaller type, in all the other languages of the Union. In this manner, as many",
  "as seventeen different scripts are represented. With each language, and each",
  "script, comes a distinct culture and regional ethos, here nesting more or less",
  "comfortably with the idea of India as a whole.",
  "Some Western observers \u2013 usually Americans \u2013 believed that this profu-",
  "sion of tongues would be the undoing of India. Based on their own country;s",
  "experience, where English had been the glue binding the different waves of",
  "immigrants,theythoughtthatasinglelanguage\u2013beitHindiorEnglish\u2013had",
  "to be spoken by all Indians. Linguistic states they regarded as a grievous er-",
  "ror. Thus, in a book published as late as 1970, and at the end of his stint as",
  "the Washington Post\u2019s man in India, Bernard Nossiter wrote despairingly that",
  "this was \u2018a land of Babel with no common voice\u2019. The creation of linguistic",
  "states would \u2018further divide the states from each other [and] heighten the im-",
  "pulsetowardsecession\u2019.FromitsbirththeIndiannationhadbeen\u2018plaguedby",

  "That, to survive, a nation-state had necessarily to privilege one language",
  "was a view that the Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin shared with American liber-",
  "als.Stalininsistedthat\u2018anationalcommunityisinconceivablewithoutacom-",

  "in which all citizens of the USSR can more or less express themselves \u2013 that",
  "is Russian\u2019.17",
  "Like Bernard Nossiter, Stalin too might have feared for the future of",
  "the Indian nation-state because of its encouragement of linguistic diversity.",
  "In fact, exactly the reverse has happened: the sustenance of linguistic plur-",
  "alism has worked to tame and domesticate secessionist tendencies. A com-",
  "parison with neighbouring countries might be helpful. In 1956, the year the",
  "states of India were reorganized on the basis of language, the Parliament of",
  "Sri Lanka (then Ceylon)introduced legislation recognizing Sinhala as the sole",
  "official language of the country. The intention was to make Sinhala the me-",
  "dium of instruction in all state schools and colleges, in public examinations",
  "and in the courts. Potentially the hardest hit were the Tamil-speaking minor-",
  "ity who lived in the north of the island, and whose feelings were eloquently",
  "expressedbytheirrepresentatives inParliament. \u2018Whenyoudenymemylan-",

  "the European experience, they believed that the only way for independent In-",
  "dia to survive and prosper would be to forge a bond, or bonds, that overlay",
  "or submerged the diversity that lay below. The glue, as in Europe, could be",
  "provided by religion, or language, or both. Such was the nationalism once",
  "promoted by the old Jana Sangh and promoted now, in a more sophisticated",
  "form, by the BJP. This reaches deep into the past to invoke a common (albeit",
  "mostly mythical) \u2018Aryan ancestry for the Hindus, a common history of suf-",

  "A popular slogan of the original Jana Sangh was \u2018Hindi, Hindu, Hindus-",
  "tani\u2019. The attempt was to makeIndian nationalism more natural, by making \u2013",
  "or persuading \u2013 all Indiansto speak the same language and worship the same",
  "gods. In time, the bid to impose a uniform language was dropped. But the de-",
  "sire to impose the will of the majority religion persisted. This has led, as we",
  "have seen in this book, to much conflict, violence, rioting and death. Partic-",
  "ularly after the Gujarat riots of 2002, which were condoned and to some ex-",
  "tentevenapprovedbythecentralgovernment,fearswereexpressedaboutthe",
  "survival of a secular and democratic India. Thus, in a lecture delivered in the",
  "university town of Aligarh, the writer Arundhati Roy went so far as to char-",
  "acterize the BJPregime as\u2018fascist\u2019. Infact, sheusedthe term \u2018fascism eleven",
  "times in a single paragraph while describing the actions of the government in",
  "New Delhi.20",
  "Here again, Indian events and experiences were being analysed in terms",
  "carelessly borrowed from European history. To call the BJP \u2018fascist is to di-",
  "minishtheseverityandseriousnessofthemurderouscrimescommittedbythe",
  "original fascists in Italy and Germany. Many leaders of the BJP are less than",
  "appealing, but to see the party as \u2018fascist\u2019 would be both to overestimate its",
  "powers and to underestimate the democratic traditions of the Indian people.",
  "Notably,theBJPnowvigorouslypromoteslinguisticpluralism.Nolongerareits leaders from the Hindi heartland alone; and it has expanded its influence",

  "some BJP leaders privately wish for a theocratic Hindu state, for public con-",
  "sumption they must endorse the secular ideals of the Indian Constitution.",
  "Finally, despite all their best efforts, the BJP was not able to disturb",
  "the democratic edifice of the Indian polity. A month after Arundhati Roy de-",

  "The holding of the 1977 elections \u2013 called by an individual who had",
  "proven dictatorial tendencies \u2013 and of the 2004 elections \u2013 called by a party",

  "deep roots that democracy had struck in the soil of India. In this respect, the",

  "Those who came afterwards could disturb and degrade the tree of democracy",

  "Indian nationalism has not been based on a shared language, religion, or",
  "ethnicidentity.Perhapsoneshouldtheninvokethepresenceofacommonen-",
  "emy, namely European colonialism. The problem here is the methods used to",
  "achieve India\u2019s freedom. The historian Michael Howard claims that \u2018no Na-",

  "ent in a common and shared endeavour. However, their (eventually success-",
  "ful) movement for political freedom eschewed violent revolution in favour of",
  "non-violent resistance. India emerged as a nation on the world stage without",
  "an armed conflict or, indeed, the threat of one.",
  "Gandhi and company have been widely praised for preferring peaceful",
  "protest to armed struggle. However, they should be equally commended for",
  "having the wisdom to retain, after the British left, such aspects of the colonial",
  "legacy as might prove useful in the new nation.",
  "The colonialists were often chastised by the nationalists for promoting",
  "democracy at home while denying it in the colonies. When the British finally",
  "left, it was expected the Indians would embrace metropolitan traditions such",
  "as parliamentary democracy and Cabinet government. More surprising per-haps was their endorsement and retention of a quintessentially colonial tradi-",
  "tion \u2013 the civil service.",
  "The key men in British India were the members of the Indian Civil Ser-",
  "vice (ICS). In the countryside they kept the peace and collected the taxes,",
  "whileintheSecretariattheyoversawpolicyandgenerallykeptthemachinery",
  "of state well oiled. Although there was the odd rotten egg, these were mostly",
  "men of integrity and ability.24 A majority were British, but there were also a",
  "fair number of Indians in the ICS.",
  "When Independence came, the new government had to decide what to",
  "do with the Indian civil servants. Nationalists who had been jailed by them",
  "argued that they should be dismissed or at least put in their place. The home",
  "minister,VallabhbhaiPatel,however,feltthattheyshouldbeallowedtoretain",
  "their pay and perquisites, and in fact be placed in positions of greater author-",
  "ity. In October 1949 a furious debate broke out on the subject in the Constitu-",
  "ent Assembly of India. Some members complained that the ICS men still had",
  "the\u2018mentality[ofrulers]lingeringinthem\u2019.Theyhadapparently\u2018notchanged",
  "theirmanners\u2019,\u2018notreconciledthemselvestothenewsituation\u2019.\u2018Theydonot",
  "feel that they are part and parcel of this country\u2019, insisted one nationalist.",
  "Vallabhbhai Patel had himself been jailed many times by ICS men, but",
  "this experience had only confirmed his admiration for them. He knew that",
  "without them the Pax Britannica would simply have been inconceivable. And",
  "he understood that the complex machinery of a modern independent nation-",
  "state needed such officers even more. As he reminded the members of the as-",
  "sembly,thenewconstitutioncouldbeworkedonly\u2018byaringofServicewhich",
  "will keep the country intact\u2019. He testified to the ability of the ICS men, but",

  "was clear that \u2018these people are the instruments [of national unity]. Remove",
  "them and I see nothing but a picture of chaos all over the country.\u201925",
  "Inthosefirst,terriblydifficultyearsofIndianfreedom,theICSmenvin-",
  "dicated Vallabhbhai Patel\u2019s trust in them. They helped integrate the princely",
  "states, resettle the refugees and plan and oversee the first general election.",
  "Other tasks assigned to them were more humdrum but equally consequential",

  "This, like its predecessor, is truly an \u2018elite\u2019 cadre. The competition to",
  "enter the higher civil services is ferocious. In 1996, 120,712 candidates ap-",
  "peared for the examination, of whom a mere 738 were finally selected. Their",
  "intelligence and ability is of a very high order. However, there are complaints",
  "ofincreasingcorruptionamongitsmembers,andoftheirsuccumbingtooeas-",
  "ily to their political masters. Perhaps if the IAS is abolished at one stroke the",
  "country will not descend into chaos. But as it stands IAS officers play a vital",
  "role in maintaining its unity.26 In times of crisis they tend to rise to the chal-",
  "lenge. After the tsunami of 2004, for example, IAS officers in Tamil Nadu",
  "were commended for their outstanding work in relief and rehabilitation.",
  "It was an ICS man, Sukumar Sen, who laid the groundwork for elections",
  "in India, and it has been IAS men who have kept the machinery going. The",
  "chief election commissioners in the states are drawn from the service. Junior",
  "officers supervise polls in their districts; those in the middle ranks serve as",
  "election observers, reporting on violations of procedure. More generally, the",

  "pay close attention to what people think and demand. In this respect, their job",
  "is probably even harder than that of their predecessors in the ICS.",
  "A colonial institution that has played an equally vital role is the Indian",
  "army. Its reputation took a battering after the China war of 1962, before it re-",
  "deemed itself through its performance in successive wars with Pakistan. The",
  "blows inflicted by Tamil insurgents in Sri Lanka in 1987\u20138 dented the army",
  "somewhat, butthenhonourwasrestored bythesuccessful oustingoftheKar-",
  "gil intruders a decade later. While its reputation as a fighting force has gone",

  "there is a flood, famine, cyclone or earthquake, it is the army which is often",
  "first on the scene, and always the most efficient and reliable actor around.",
  "The Indian army is a professional and wholly non-sectarian body. It is",
  "also apolitical. Almost from the first moments of Independence, Jawaharlal",
  "Nehru made it clear to the army top brass that in matters of state \u2013 both large",
  "and small \u2013 they had to subordinate themselves to the elected politicians. At",
  "the time of the transfer of power the army was still headed by a British gen-",
  "eral, who had ordered that the public be kept away from a flag-hoisting ce-",
  "remony to be held on the day after Independence. As prime minister, Nehru",
  "rescinded the order, and wrote to the general as follows:",
  "While I am desirous of paying attention to the views and susceptibilities",
  "of our senior officers, British and Indian, it seems to me that there is a",
  "grave misunderstanding about the matter. In any policy that is to be pur-",
  "sued, in the Army or otherwise, the views of the Government of India",
  "and the policy they lay down must prevail. If any person is unable to lay",
  "down that policy, he has no place in the Indian Army, or in the Indian",
  "structure of Government. I think this should be made perfectly clear at",
  "this stage.27",
  "AyearlateritwasVallabhbhaiPatel\u2019sturntoputaBritishgeneralinhisplace.",
  "WhenthegovernmentdecidedtomoveagainsttheNizam,thecommander-in-",
  "chief, General Roy Bucher, warned that sending troops into Hyderabad might",
  "provoke Pakistan to attack Amritsar. Patel told Bucher that if he opposed the",
  "Hyderabad action he was free to resign. The general backed down, and sent",
  "the troops as ordered.28",
  "Shortly afterwards Bucher retired, to be succeeded by the first Indian C-",
  "in-C,GeneralK.M.Cariappa.AtthebeginningofhistenureCariapparestric-",
  "ted himself to military matters, but as he grew into the job he began to offer",
  "his views on such questions as India\u2019s preferred model of economic develop-",
  "ment. In October 1952 Nehru wrote advising him to give fewer press confer-",
  "ences, and at any rate to stick to safe subjects. He also enclosed a letter from",
  "oneofhisCabinetcolleagues,whichcomplainedthatCariappawas\u2018givingso",
  "many speeches and holding so many Press Conferences all over the country\u2019,",
  "giving the impression that he was \u2018playing the role of apolitical or semi-polit-",
  "ical leader\u2019.29The message seems to have gone home, for when Cariappa demitted of-",
  "fice in January 1953, in his farewell speech he \u2018exhorted soldiers to give a",
  "wide berth to politics\u2019. The army\u2019s job, he said, was not \u2018to meddle in polit-",
  "ics but to give unstinted loyalty to the elected Government\u2019.30 Nehru knew,",
  "however, that the general was something of a loose cannon, who could not be",
  "completely trusted to follow his own advice. Within three months of his re-",

  "As the first Indian to head the army, Cariappa carried a certain cachet,",
  "which lost its lustre with every passing month after he had left office. By the",
  "time he came back from Australia Cariappa was a forgotten man. Nehru\u2019s",
  "foresight was confirmed, however, by the statements the general made from",
  "time to time. In 1958 he visited Pakistan, where army officers who had",
  "servedwithhiminundividedIndiahadjusteffectedacoup.Cariappapublicly",

  "terandthespiritoftheconstitution.Fortunately,thepiecewasreturnedbythe",
  "editor, who pointed out to the general that \u2018it would be embarrassing in the",
  "circumstances both to you and to us to publish this article\u2019.33",
  "The pattern set in those early years has persisted into the present. As",
  "Lieutenant General J. S. Aurora notes, Nehru \u2018laid down some very good",
  "norms\u2019,whichensuredthat\u2018politicsinthearmyhasbeenalmostabsent\u2019.\u2018The",

  "especially \u2018must be the most apolitical people on earth!\u201934 It is a striking fact",
  "that no army commander has ever fought an election. Aurora himself became",

  "been at the invitation of the government. Some, like Cariappa, have been sent",
  "as ambassadors overseas; others have served as state governors.The army, like the civil services, is a colonial institution that has been",

  "To reach out to regions other than one\u2019s own, its use was indispensable. Thus",
  "a pan-Indian, anti-British consciousness was created, in good part by thinkers",
  "and activists writing in the English language.",
  "After Independence, among the most articulate advocates for English",
  "was C. Rajagopalachari. The colonial rulers, he wrote, had \u2018for certain acci-",
  "dental reasons, causes and purposes ... left behind [in India] a vast body of",
  "the English language\u2019. But now it had come there was no need for it to go",
  "away. For English \u2018is ours. We need not send it back to Britain along with",
  "Englishmen. He humorously added that, according to Indian tradition, it was",
  "a Hindu goddess, Saraswati, who had given birth to all the languages of the",
  "world.ThusEnglish\u2018belongedtousbyorigin,theoriginatorbeingSaraswati,",
  "and also by acquisition\u2019.35",
  "On the other hand, there were some very influential nationalists who be-",
  "lieved that English must be thrown out of India with the British. In Nehru\u2019s",
  "day, fitful attempts were made to replace English with Hindi as the language",
  "of inter-provincial communication. But it continued to be in use within and",
  "outsidegovernment.VisitingIndiain1961theCanadianwriterGeorgeWood-",

  "of individual as well as social advancement. As the historian Sarvepalli Gopal",
  "observes, \u2018that knowledge of English is the passport for employment at higherlevels in all fields, is the unavoidable avenue to status and wealth and is man-",
  "datorytoallthoseplanningtomigrateabroad,hasmeantatremendousenthu-",
  "siasmsinceindependencetostudyit\u2019.But,asGopalalsowrites,English\u2018may",
  "be described as the only non-regional language in India. It is a link language",
  "in a more than administrative sense, in that it counters blinkered provincial-",
  "ism.\u201937",
  "Those, like Nehru and Rajaji, who sought to retain English, sensed that",
  "it might help consolidate national unity and further scientific advance. That",
  "it has done, but largely unanticipated has been its role in fuelling economic",
  "growth. For behind the spectacular rise of the software industry lies the profi-",
  "ciency of Indian engineers in English.",
  "V",
  "If India is roughly 50 per cent democratic, it is approximately 80 per cent",
  "united. Some parts of Kashmir and the north-east are under the control of",
  "insurgents seeking political independence. Some forested districts in central",
  "India are in the grip of Maoist revolutionaries. However, these areas, large",
  "enough in themselves, constitute considerably less than a quarter of the total",
  "land mass claimed by the Indian nation.",
  "Over four-fifths of India, the elected government enjoys a legitimacy of",
  "power and authority. Throughout this territory the citizens of India are free to",
  "live, study, take employment and invest in businesses.",
  "The economic integration of India is a consequence of its political integ-",
  "ration. They act in a mutually reinforcing loop. The greater the movement of",
  "goods and capital and people across India, the greater the sense that this is,",
  "after all, one country. In the first decades of Independence it was the public",
  "sector that did most to further this sense of unity. In plants such as the great",
  "steel mill in Bhilai, Andhras laboured and lived alongside Punjabis and Gu-",

  "successful; among the children of the first generation of workers, themselves",
  "born and raised in Bhilai, provincial loyalties were superseded by a more in-",
  "clusive patriotism, a \u2018more cosmopolitan cultural style\u2019.38Morerecently,ithasbeentheprivatesectorwhichhas,ifwithlessintent,",

  "Nadu set up cement plants in Haryana; doctors born and educated in Assam",

  "come from Bihar. The migration is not restricted to the professional classes;",
  "therearebarbersfromUttarPradeshworkinginthecityofBangalore,aswell",
  "as carpenters from Rajasthan. However, it must be said that the flow is not",
  "symmetrical.Whilethecitiesandtownsthatare\u2018booming\u2019becomeevermore",
  "cosmopolitan, economically laggard states sink deeper into provincialism.",
  "VI",
  "Apartfromelementsofpoliticsandeconomics,culturalfactorshavealsocon-",
  "tributed to national unity. Pre-eminent here is the Hindi film. This is the great",
  "popular passion of the Indian people, watched and followed by Indians of all",
  "ages, genders, castes, classes, religions and linguistic groups.",
  "Each formally recognized state of the Union, says the lyricist Javed",
  "Akhtar, \u2018has its different culture, tradition and style. In Gujarat, you have one",
  "kindofculture,thenyougotoPunjab,youhaveanother,andthesameapplies",
  "inRajasthan, Bengal,OrissaorKerala.ThenAkhtaradds,\u2018Thereisonemore",
  "state in this country, and that is Hindi cinema.\u201939",
  "This is a stunning insight which asks to be developed further. As a sep-",
  "arate state of India, Hindi cinema acts as a receptacle for all that (in a cultural",
  "sense) is most creative in the other states. Thus its actors, musicians, techni-",
  "cians and directors come from all parts of India. Thus also it draws ecumen-",
  "ically from cultural forms prevalent in different regions. For example a single",
  "songmayfeatureboththePunjabifolkdancecalledthebhangraanditsTamil",
  "classical counterpart, bharatan-atyam.",
  "Having borrowed elements from here, there and everywhere, the Hindi",
  "filmthensendsthesynthesizedproductoutforappreciationtotheotherstates",
  "of the Union. The most widely revered Indians are film stars. Yet cinema",
  "does not merely provide Indians with a common pantheon of heroes; it also",
  "gives them a common language and universe of discourse. Lines from film",
  "songs and snatches from film dialogue are ubiquitously used in conversations",
  "in schools, colleges, homes and offices \u2013 and on the street. Because it is one",
  "morestateoftheUnion,Hindicinemaalsospeaksitsownlanguage\u2013onethat",
  "is understood by all the others.The last sentence is meant literally as well as metaphorically. Hindi",
  "cinema provides a stock of social situations and moral conundrums which",
  "widely resonate with the citizenry as a whole. But, over time, it has also made",
  "the Hindi language more comprehensible to those who previously never spoke",
  "or understood it. When imposed by fiat by the central government, Hindi wasresisted by the people of the south and the east. When conveyed seductively",
  "bythemediumofcinemaandtelevision,Hindihasbeenacceptedbythem.In",
  "Bangalore and Hyderabad Hindi has become the preferred medium of com-",
  "munication between those who speak mutually incomprehensible tongues.",
  "Finally, one might instance the banning of Hindi films, DVDs and videos by",
  "insurgents in the north-east: this, in its own way, is a considerable tribute to",
  "the part played by the Hindi film in uniting India.",
  "In 1888 John Strachey wrote that he could never imagine that Punjab",
  "and Madras could ever form part of a single political entity. But in 1947 they",
  "did, along with many other provinces Strachey regarded as distinct \u2018nations\u2019.",
  "Whilein1947theunitymighthavebeenmostlypolitical,inthedecadessince",
  "it has been shown also to be economic, cultural and, it must be said, emotion-",
  "al. Perhaps many Kashmiris and Nagas yet feel alien and separate. And per-",
  "haps some revolutionaries believe that India is a land of many nationalities.",
  "ButthebulkofthosewhoarelegallycitizensofIndiaarehappytobecounted",
  "as such. Some four-fifths of the population, living in some four-fifths of the",
  "country, clearly feel themselves to be part of a single nation.",
  "VII",
  "One might think of independent India as being Europe\u2019s past as well as its fu-",
  "ture. It is Europe\u2019s past, in that it has reproduced, albeit more fiercely and in-",
  "tensely, the conflicts of a modernizing, industrializing and urbanizing society.",
  "But itisalso its futureinthat itanticipated, bysome fiftyyears, theEuropean",
  "attempttocreateamultilingual, multireligious, multiethnic, political andeco-",
  "nomic community.",
  "Or one might compare India with the United States, a country justly cel-",
  "ebrated as \u2018the planet\u2019s first multiethnic democracy\u2019.40 Born nearly two cen-",
  "turieslater,theRepublicofIndiaistodaycomfortablytheworld\u2019slargestmul-",
  "tiethnic democracy. However, the means by which it has regulated (and mod-",
  "erated) relations between its constituent ethnicities have been somewhat dif-",
  "ferent. For, as Samuel Huntingdon has recently argued, the American nation",
  "has been held together by a \u2018credal culture\u2019 whose \u2018central elements\u2019 have in-",
  "cluded \u2018the Christian religion, Protestant values and moralism, a work ethic,",
  "the English language, British traditions of law, justice, and the limits of gov-",
  "ernment power, and a legacy of European art, literature, philosophy, and mu-",
  "sic\u2019.Indeed,\u2018AmericawascreatedasaProtestantsocietyjustasandforsomeof the reasons Pakistan and Israel were created as Muslim and Jewish societ-",
  "ies in the twentieth century.\u2019",
  "The United States is, of course, a nation of immigrants. For much of",
  "the country\u2019s history the new groups that came in merged themselves with",
  "the dominant culture. \u2018Throughout American history\u2019, writes Huntingdon,",
  "\u2018people who were not white Anglo-Saxon Protestants have become Americ-",
  "ans by adopting America\u2019s Anglo-Protestant culture and political values\u2019. Of",
  "late, however, newer groups of immigrants have tended to maintain their dis-",
  "tinct identities. The largest of these are the Hispanics, who live in enclaves",
  "wheretheycooktheirownfood,listentotheirownkindofmusic,followtheir",
  "own faith and \u2013 most importantly \u2013 speak their own language. Huntingdon",
  "worries that if these communities are not quickly brought in to line, they will",
  "\u2018transform America as a whole into a bilingual, bicultural society .",
  "The older American model of assimilation was called \u2018the melting-pot\u2019.",
  "Individual groups poured all their flavours into the pot, then drank asingle,",
  "uniform \u2013 or uniformly tasting \u2013 drink. Now it appears that the society, and",
  "nation, are coming to resemble a \u2018salad bowl\u2019, with each group starkly stand-",
  "ing out, different and distinctive in how it looks and behaves.",
  "Huntingdon himself is less than enthusiastic about the idea of the salad",
  "bowl. For him, America has long been, and must always be, a \u2018society with a",
  "single pervasive national culture\u2019. He observes that Americans identify most",
  "strongly with that culture when the nation is under threat. War leads not",
  "merelytonationalconsolidation,butalsotoculturalunity.TheoriginalAmer-",
  "icanCreedwasforgedasaconsequenceofthewarsagainsttheNativeAmer-",
  "icans, the English colonists and the Southern States. The events of 9/11 once",
  "more brought patriotism and national solidarity to the fore. Concerned that",
  "these energies will dissipate, Huntingdon urges a more thoroughgoing return",
  "tothecreedthat,inhisview,wasresponsiblefor\u2018theunityandstrengthofmy",
  "country\u2019.41",
  "Interestingly, Huntingdon\u2019s views find an echo in recent statements by",
  "the prime minister of Australia, John Howard. That country too has been sub-",
  "ject to successive waves of immigration, mostly or wholly European to be-",
  "ginwith,butmorerecentlyofamarkedlyAsiancharacter.Howardrejectsthe",
  "possibility of a plurality of cultures co-existing in Australia. \u2018You ve got to",
  "have a dominant culture\u2019, he says, adding, \u2018Ours is Anglo-Saxon \u2013 our lan-",
  "guage, our literature, our institutions.\u201942",
  "The Huntingdon\u2013Howard line of reasoning is, of course, quite familiar",
  "tostudentsofIndianhistory.IthasbeenmadeinIndiabypolitical ideologues",
  "such as M. S. Golwalkar and by political parties such as the Jana Sangh andtheBJP.TheyhavearguedthatIndiahas\u2018gottohaveadominantculture\u2019,and",
  "that thisculture is\u2018Hindu\u2019.Asithappened, thoseviewswerenotendorsedby",
  "the founders of the Indian nation, by those who wrote the Indian Constitution",
  "and led the first few governments of independent India. Thus India became a",
  "salad-bowl nation rather than a melting-pot one.",
  "And it has stayed that way. It has sustained a diversity of religions and",
  "languages, precisely the diversities that the likes of Howard and Huntingdon",
  "deem inimical to national survival and national solidarity. It has resisted the",
  "pressures to go in the other direction, to follow Israel and Pakistan by favour-",
  "ing citizens who follow a certain faith or speak a particular language.",
  "VIII",
  "The most eloquent tribute to the idea of India that I have come across rests in",
  "some unpublished letters of the biologist J. B. S. Haldane. In his native Bri-",
  "tain, Haldane was a figure of considerable fame and some notoriety. In 1956,",
  "already past sixty, he decided to leave his post in University College London",
  "and take up residence in Calcutta. He joined the Indian Statistical Institute,",
  "became an Indian citizen, wore Indian clothes and ate Indian food. He also",
  "travelledenergeticallyaroundthecountry,engagingwithitsscientistsbutalso",
  "with the citizenry at large.43",
  "FiveyearsafterHaldanehadmovedtoIndia,anAmericansciencewriter",
  "described him in print as a \u2018citizen of the world\u2019. Haldane replied:",
  "No doubt I am in some sense a citizen of the world. But I believe with",
  "Thomas Jefferson that one of the chief duties of a citizen is to be a nuis-",
  "ance to the government of his state. As there is no world state, I cannot",
  "do this . . . On the other hand I can be, and am, a nuisance to the govern-",
  "mentofIndia,whichhasthemeritofpermittingagooddealofcriticism,",
  "though it reacts to it rather slowly. I also happen to be proud of being a",
  "citizen of India, which is a lot more diverse than Europe, let alone the",
  "USA, USSR, or China, and thus a better model for a possible world or-",
  "ganisation. It may of course break up, but it is a wonderful experiment.",
  "So I want to be labelled as a citizen of India.44On another occasion Haldane described India as \u2018the closest approximation",
  "to the Free World\u2019. An American friend protested, saying his impression was",
  "that \u2018India has its fair share of scoundrels and a tremendous amount of poor",
  "unthinking and disgustingly subservient individuals who are not attractive\u2019.45",
  "To this Haldane responded:",
  "Perhaps one is freer to be as coundrel in India than elsewhere. So one",
  "was in the USA in the days of people like Jay Gould, when (in my opin-",
  "ion)therewasmoreinternalfreedomintheUSAthanthereistoday.The",
  "\u2018disgusting subservience\u2019 of the others has its limits. The people of Cal-",
  "cuttariot,upsettrams,andrefusetoobeypoliceregulations,inamanner",
  "which would have delighted Jefferson. I don\u2019t think their activities are",
  "very efficient, but that is not the question at issue.46",
  "Forty years down the line, what Haldane called a \u2018wonderful experiment\u2019",
  "might be counted as a success, a modest success. Poverty persists in some",
  "(admittedly broad) pockets, yet one can now be certain that India will not go",
  "the way of sub-Saharan Africa and witness widespread famine. Secessionist",
  "movementsareactivehereandthere,butthereisnolongeranyfearthatIndia",
  "will follow the former Yugoslavia and break up into a dozen fratricidal parts.",
  "The powers of the state are sometimes grossly abused, but no one seriously",
  "thinks that India will emulate neighbouring Pakistan, where the chief of army",
  "staff is generally also head of government.",
  "As a modern nation, India is simply sui generic. It stands on its own,",
  "different and distinct from the alternative political models on offer \u2013 be",
  "these Anglo-Saxon liberalism, French republicanism, atheistic communism,",
  "or Islamic theocracy. Back in 1971, at the time of the Bangladesh crisis,",
  "whenIndiafounditselfsimultaneouslyatoddswithcommunistChina,Islam-",
  "ic Pakistan and America, an Indian diplomat captured his country\u2019s unique-",
  "ness in this way:",
  "IndiaisregardedwarilyintheWestbecausesheisagainsttheconceptof",
  "Imperialism and because she \u2018invented\u2019 the \u2018Third World\u2019.",
  "India is looked on with suspicion in the \u2018Third World\u2019 because",
  "of her (subversive) sentiments for democracy, human rights, etc.; the",
  "Muslim world is wrathful because of our secularism.The Communist countries regard India as insolent \u2013 and potentially",
  "dangerous \u2013 because we have rejected Communism as the prime condi-",
  "tion for Progress.",
  "We are, of course, on the side of God. But is God on our side?47",
  "The writer whose lines open this book, the nineteenth-century poet Ghalib,",
  "thoughtthatGodwasindeedonthesideofIndia.Allaroundhimwereconflict",
  "andprivation,butdoomsdayhadnotyetcome.\u2018WhydoesnottheLastTrum-",

  "The hoary old man of lucent ken",
  "Pointed towards Kashi and gently smiled.",
  "\u2018The Architect\u2019, he said, \u2018is fond of this edifice",
  "Because of which there is colour in life; He",
  "Would not like it to perish and fall\u2019.",
  "Ghalib and his interlocutor were speaking then of India, the civilization.",

  "In close to five decades as a citizen of India I have had plenty of opportunity",
  "to discover that this is sometimes the most exasperating country in the world.",
  "However, it was only while working on its modern history that I found that it",
