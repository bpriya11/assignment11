  "India Rising?",
  "T",
  " he rest of the world clearly thinks that India",
  " will be one of the leading players in the world",
  " a  few  decades  from  now.  Five  years  ago,  in ",
  "October  2003,  the  \u2018BRICs  Report\u2019  of  Goldman  Sachs,  the ",
  "world\u2019s leading investment banking, securities and investment ",
  "management \ufb01 rm, had created waves when it forecast the ",
  "growing importance of the economies of Brazil, Russia, India ",
  "and China in the coming decades. One of its conclusions was ",
  "that in the long term India is a potentially greater growth story ",
  "than China. The argument was that its favourable demographic ",
  "pro\ufb01 le  and  dynamic  private  sector  would  enable  India  to ",
  "become the world\u2019s third largest economy by 2050. In a follow-",
  "up Report in 2007, Goldman Sachs predicted that between ",
  "2007 and 2020 India\u2019s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per ",
  "capita in US dollar terms would quadruple, and that by 2043 ",
  "the Indian economy would be bigger than the US economy. ",
  "In March 2006, PricewaterhouseCoopers, one of the world\u2019s ",
  "largest professional services \ufb01 rms, had published a report on ",
  "the  increasing  global  signi\ufb01 cance  of  the  \u2018E\u20137\u2019  emerging ",
  "economies comprising the four BRIC countries, plus Mexico, ",
  "Indonesia and Turkey. Two years later, in its updated report of ",
  "March 2008, PricewaterhouseCoopers is even more optimistic ",
  "about the potential of China and India. PricewaterhouseCoopers ",
  "sees India as the third largest economy by 2050, by when India\u2019s ",
  "GDP would be nearly 90 per cent of the US\u2019, slightly over two-",
  "thirds of China\u2019s, and as large as the combined GDPs of Japan,  292 CHALLENGE AND STRATEGY ",
  "Germany, United Kingdom (UK), France, Italy, Canada and ",
  "Spain! ",
  "It is not just the world\u2019s in\ufb02 uential banks and consultancy ",
  "\ufb01 rms that are talking about India as an increasingly weighty ",
  "actor on the world stage in the coming decades. India\u2019s central ",
  "role in the WTO negotiations and its involvement in all the ",
  "new groupings that have come up in the 21st century such as ",
  "O\u20135, SCO, EAS, BRIC and China\u2013India\u2013Brazil\u2013South Africa ",
  "(CHIBSA), testify to its increased relevance in the eyes of the ",
  "rest of the world. As the \ufb01 nancial crisis unfolds, there is an ",
  "urgent realization, now being increasingly articulated publicly ",
  "by in\ufb02 uential decision-makers around the world, that India has ",
  "to be involved in managing the affairs of the world. This should ",
  "make Indians more self-con\ufb01 dent that it is the world that will ",
  "have to adjust to India rather than the other way round.",
  "Such global optimism and expectations about India have ",
  "led many in India to exult about India\u2019s seemingly inexorable ",
  "rise. There has been unwarranted hyperbole among Indian ",
  "of\ufb01 cialdom, corporate India and sections of the intelligentsia ",
  "about a \u2018shining\u2019 or \u2018incredible\u2019 India. A large section of the ",
  "Indian urban elite, which has arrogated to itself the right to ",
  "determine what constitutes national interest, really believes ",
  "that India has already become \u2018First World\u2019 and should jettison ",
  "its \u2018Third World\u2019 baggage. True, India has come a long way. ",
  "India\u2019s considerable assets, which should be leveraged, include ",
  "its size and pivotal geographical location in the heart of Asia; ",
  "a growing and youthful population that is in contrast to the ",
  "demographic trends in most other countries or regions that are ",
  "present or potential poles of in\ufb02 uence and power in the world; ",
  "a strong scienti\ufb01 c and technological base; an open society with ",
  "a long tradition of individuality and innovation; a diversi\ufb01 ed ",
  "economy with a promising rate of economic growth; deeply ",
  "embedded democratic traditions, a secular polity and the rule ",
  "of law that provide resilience and some insurance against ",
  "social and political instability and various elements of India\u2019s ",
  "\u2018soft power\u2019.",
  "Although India does possess many attributes of a great ",
  "power, huge parts of India remain undeveloped. It is only the ",
  "elite that aspire for a \u2018green card\u2019; most Indians would happily INDIA RISING? 293",
  "settle for a mere \u2018ration card\u2019! India\u2019s foreign policy makers ",
  "should never forget its realities. Many factors continue to ",
  "hold back India. These include paucity of energy resources, as ",
  "well as looming fresh water and possibly even food shortages; ",
  "alarming environmental and ecological degradation; widespread ",
  "poverty; uneven development that has created growing regional ",
  "disparities and left large sections of the population out of ",
  "the developmental process; communal tensions; a weak and ",
  "vacillating leadership; a growing credibility gap between the ",
  "masses  and  the  ruling  elite;  deep-rooted  corruption;  poor ",
  "infrastructure; a generally unresponsive bureaucracy; illiteracy ",
  "and falling educational standards; an antiquated legal and ",
  "regulatory framework and policies that undermine meritocracy ",
  "and are unable to attract the most talented people into public ",
  "service for jobs as military of\ufb01 cers, civil servants, doctors, ",
  "teachers, scientists and technologists. If India is to become ",
  "an in\ufb02 uential player in the world these weaknesses must be ",
  "overcome. This requires a strong and bold leadership that can ",
  "muster broad and active popular support for its policies.",
  "Connecting with People",
  "In India, as in most countries around the world, people in ",
  "general have tended to regard foreign policy as an esoteric ",
  "activity to which they cannot easily relate their personal inter-",
  "est and welfare. Such perceptions are understandable. In the ",
  "21st century, unlike in earlier times when foreign policy had an ",
  "elitist character, globalization and the revolution in information ",
  "and communication technologies have made India\u2019s foreign ",
  "policy  challenges  far  more  complex  and  dif\ufb01 cult.  Among ",
  "other factors, a much higher level of trade and other economic ",
  "interaction, including movement of capital and labour across ",
  "international borders, has become increasingly important for ",
  "India\u2019s economic development. Economic liberalization has ",
  "raised the stakes and in\ufb02 uence of the private sector in foreign ",
  "affairs. Today, an increasing number of Indians, particularly ",
  "the young\u2014students, professionals, and businessmen\u2014have ",
  "global interests and see themselves as global citizens. There is a  294 CHALLENGE AND STRATEGY ",
  "sharp rise in general public awareness of foreign policy issues. ",
  "This makes it all the more necessary and important that there ",
  "should be a wider public discussion and deeper understanding ",
  "of foreign policy issues among all stakeholders.",
  "Diplomacy  can  no  longer  be  conducted  in  a  rare\ufb01 ed ",
  "atmosphere. Nor is it the exclusive preserve of diplomats and ",
  "of\ufb01 cialdom. The government will always remain the central ",
  "player in India\u2019s foreign policy, but it is not the only one. ",
  "Government has to play an important coordinating role with all ",
  "other concerned institutions, organizations and interest groups. ",
  "Foreign  policy  issues  require  understanding  and  support ",
  "among India\u2019s political class, corporate leaders, journalists, ",
  "academics and all other sections of the intelligentsia. India\u2019s ",
  "foreign policy framework is determined by national interest, ",
  "including  overriding  domestic  priorities  such  as  poverty ",
  "alleviation, economic development and people\u2019s welfare. In a ",
  "democracy like India, people must understand and support ",
  "the rationale of government\u2019s policies. Foreign policy must ",
  "show that it makes a difference to the lives of people. With a ",
  "large number of Indian states having land and/or maritime ",
  "boundaries  with  foreign  countries,  their  development  in ",
  "important  and  sometimes  critical  respects  depends  on ",
  "interaction  with  neighbouring  foreign  countries.  State ",
  "governments are getting more exposed to direct dealings with ",
  "foreign entities. The intertwining of many key foreign and ",
  "domestic policy issues, especially in dealings with neighbours, ",
  "necessitates close cooperation of the Central Government with ",
  "state governments.",
  "Changed domestic realities and priorities have made the ",
  "task of foreign policy formulation more complex. The major ",
  "parties have been unable to preserve the traditional Indian ",
  "foreign policy consensus. The phenomenon of coalition govern-",
  "ments,  now  an  inescapable  reality  in  India\u2019s  political  life, ",
  "has given small regional parties a greater say in governance, ",
  "including foreign policy. Regrettably, regional parties often ",
  "cannot  rise  above  short-term,  local  interests  and  do  not ",
  "consider foreign policy issues in a broader perspective. ",
  "Another interest group whose in\ufb02 uence on foreign policy ",
  "has  increased  is  that  of  the  af\ufb02 uent  community  of  Non-",
  "resident Indians (NRIs) and persons of Indian origin (PIOs) INDIA RISING? 295",
  "settled in the West, particularly the US and the UK. They have ",
  "strong business linkages with Indian corporate houses and ",
  "politicians, and are often important \ufb01 nanciers of many Indian ",
  "political parties. NRIs and PIOs play an important role as a ",
  "bridge between India and their country of abode\u2014in shaping ",
  "foreign perceptions about India and in furthering economic and ",
  "cultural cooperation. Sometimes, as in the case of the Khalistan ",
  "movement, NRIs can also create security problems for India. ",
  "NRIs and PIOs played an active and crucial role in lobbying ",
  "for US Congressional support for the India\u2013US nuclear deal. ",
  "To tap this asset, annual jamborees like the Pravasi Bharatiya ",
  "Divas  serve  little  useful  purpose;  there  should  be  focused ",
  "schemes attractive enough to encourage them to strengthen ",
  "linkages with India and to use their skills, talent and resources ",
  "to create capabilities in India.",
  "Separately, India will need to clarify its attitude and policy ",
  "towards besieged communities of PIOs who have been settled ",
  "for many decades in countries like Sri Lanka, Fiji and Malaysia. ",
  "In situations of crisis, their plight, which evokes sympathy ",
  "in India, could create strains in relations between India and ",
  "the concerned country. Indian workers in the Gulf constitute ",
  "a  particularly  sensitive  but  somewhat  neglected  section  of ",
  "Indians living abroad, and India will need to be constantly ",
  "alert to the need to protect their interests and promote their ",
  "welfare. There should never be an impression that India cares ",
  "only for its rich and well-off brethren abroad, not those who ",
  "are disadvantaged in their overseas homes.",
  "In a democratic country, the media is an important and ",
  "integral part of the foreign policy establishment. It can be, and ",
  "frequently is, an invaluable ally of the government, be it to test ",
  "out an idea, to generate greater public support for an initiative, ",
  "for example, the India\u2013US nuclear deal, or to establish back-",
  "channel contacts with a foreign government. Politicians under-",
  "standably want to cultivate the media. This has given editors, ",
  "columnists  and  commentators  in  the  print  and  electronic ",
  "media an opportunity to become active diplomatic players, a ",
  "role that they relish since this gives them considerable power. ",
  "However, its far-reaching in\ufb02 uence behoves the media to be ",
  "responsible  and  independent-minded.  At  times,  journalists  296 CHALLENGE AND STRATEGY ",
  "and columnists give in to the temptation of becoming instant ",
  "\u2018experts\u2019, and can mislead or prejudice viewers with their self-",
  "assured  views  and  sweeping  judgements.  Round-the-clock ",
  "news channels put the government constantly under pressure ",
  "for  instant  reactions,  with  the  result  that  sometimes  sub-",
  "optimal policy announcements are made and decisions taken ",
  "in a hurry, rather than in a considered manner\u2014for example, ",
  "the decision to release terrorists in jail in India to secure ",
  "the release of passengers in the Indian Airlines plane that ",
  "was hijacked to Kandahar in December 1999. The challenge ",
  "before the government is how to make the media a willing and ",
  "responsible partner in pursuing India\u2019s foreign policy goals.",
  "One of the innovations that the Ministry of External Affairs ",
  "has introduced is the concept of \u2018public diplomacy\u2019, an idea ",
  "that is laudable in theory but that does not appear to have been ",
  "very well implemented in practice. The one issue where public ",
  "diplomacy was sorely needed was the India\u2013US nuclear deal; ",
  "unfortunately, a small coterie of no more than a dozen people ",
  "handled this issue, and the government made no effort to build ",
  "a national consensus among political parties and civil society ",
  "on this issue. Instead the government used the media to create ",
  "the impression that there was wide support for the deal when ",
  "in fact there was not. On the other hand, an excellent example ",
  "of public diplomacy was the India\u2013ASEAN Car Rally organized ",
  "in 2004 that started from Guwahati and ended in Batam, ",
  "Indonesia after passing through Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, ",
  "Vietnam, Cambodia, Malaysia and Singapore. It brought India ",
  "into small villages throughout the region and did wonders for ",
  "India\u2019s image in the ASEAN region. The domestic impact of the ",
  "rally was equally signi\ufb01 cant. For the people of the Northeast ",
  "Region it was a matter for huge celebration, as it gave them ",
  "hope of the revival of their region\u2019s traditional connectivity ",
  "with their eastern neighbours, and of a more normal and ",
  "even exciting life beyond being the object of suspicion and ",
  "crackdown by the security forces. It is this kind of enthusiastic ",
  "public support that is essential if foreign policy initiatives are ",
  "to bear fruit.",
  "A most valuable, but an under-utilized, diplomatic asset is ",
  "India\u2019s culture. A person\u2019s personality and thinking are shaped INDIA RISING? 297",
  "by his cultural traditions. To understand another person\u2019s ",
  "culture is to know what makes him tick, to show respect to ",
  "him and, ultimately, to get through to him. For centuries, ",
  "Indian culture, religion and philosophy have attracted millions ",
  "abroad, which is why India is often called a \u2018cultural and ",
  "spiritual superpower\u2019. It is not only the traditional Indian ",
  "culture that is attracting the rest of the world. Contemporary ",
  "Indian foods, fashions and \ufb01 lms are a magnet for more and ",
  "more people throughout the world. Even though Buddhism is ",
  "not an active religion in the country, India remains the Land ",
  "of the Buddha. India is therefore rightly trying to market the ",
  "enormous  tourism  potential  of  Buddhist  destinations.  The ",
  "project to recreate the Nalanda University and to develop a ",
  "Buddhist tourism circuit augurs well for establishing closer ",
  "people-to-people links between India and many countries of ",
  "South, Southeast and East Asia. Cultural diplomacy has to be ",
  "carefully differentiated according to the target country and the ",
  "message that India is trying to convey. Used imaginatively and ",
  "intelligently, cultural diplomacy can be an important means to ",
  "achieve strategic ends.",
  "The Road Ahead",
  "As in the 19th century, capitalism in the 21st century continues ",
  "to produce many discontents, arising out of its fundamental ",
  "weakness that it cannot ensure either sustainable or inclusive ",
  "growth. The ills of capitalism in the modern era gave rise to ",
  "socialism, the de\ufb01 ning idea of the 20th century. Even if the ",
  "socialist and communist experiments around the world have ",
  "left much to be desired, the idea of socialism remains \ufb01 rmly ",
  "entrenched among hundreds of millions around the globe. The ",
  "unprecedented massive bailouts of private \ufb01 nancial institu-",
  "tions by governments all over the world have emphatically ",
  "underlined  the  responsibility  of  the  State  to  ensure  social ",
  "welfare  and  stability.  The  American  Dream  is  no  longer ",
  "achievable even for Americans, much less for the rest of the ",
  "world. Nor can one be optimistic about authoritarian forms of  298 CHALLENGE AND STRATEGY ",
  "governance. If there is to be any hope of peace, stability and ",
  "harmony in an increasingly turbulent world where expecta-",
  "tions have outstripped resources and now threaten to destabi-",
  "lize an iniquitous global political and economic order, the world ",
  "needs a model of development that takes care of the interests ",
  "of the world\u2019s underprivileged and dispossessed billions. Does ",
  "India have something to offer the world?",
  "In its foreign policy, India can and must play its role as ",
  "conscience-keeper  of  the  world.  The  realist  or  pragmatic ",
  "school of foreign policy that holds sway in India today scoffs at ",
  "any suggestion that morality has a role in world affairs. They ",
  "believe that power \ufb02 ows out of the barrel of a gun, and that ",
  "non-violence, as one critic has eloquently put it, is \u2018a form of ",
  "masochistic surrender\u2019. Morality, alas, cannot be wished away. ",
  "It remains the core principle of all religions and continues ",
  "to guide individual human behaviour. In politics and inter-",
  "national affairs, it is a widely employed strategic psychological ",
  "tool. The practitioners of realpolitik in all countries, including ",
  "India, invariably rely on moral arguments\u2014be it to persuade, ",
  "to convince, or to justify. The veneer of morality is what gives ",
  "legitimacy to arbitrariness. ",
  "Half  a  century  ago,  a  comparatively  weak  India  had ",
  "a stronger voice in the world because there was a certain ",
  "morality and therefore a welcome boldness in India\u2019s foreign ",
  "policy. India was seen as a leader. Mahatma Gandhi, because ",
  "of his moral and ethical view of life, has probably done more ",
  "for the cause of peace and the image of India abroad than any ",
  "other Indian. Today, regrettably, India is being seen as a camp ",
  "follower. Perceptions do matter, perhaps more than reality. ",
  "As a junior partner, India will not make it to the high table. ",
  "Leadership implies not just economic and military strength, ",
  "but also ideas that inspire and motivate. Has the escalating ",
  "level of violence in the world, which has brought suffering and ",
  "misery to millions, \ufb01 nally awakened the world\u2019s conscience ",
  "to the need for a revolution against violence? What can and ",
  "should be India\u2019s role in this? The election of Barack Obama, ",
  "a  self-confessed  admirer  of  Mahatma  Gandhi,  as  the  US ",
  "President has raised hopes that there could be a fundamental ",
  "change in US foreign policy. Is there reason to believe that a INDIA RISING? 299",
  "new Indian Government and the Obama Administration could ",
  "have a convergence of views on this matter? These are issues ",
  "that India should ponder over.",
  "India can draw inspiration, as well as lessons, from its past. ",
  "In ancient times, India had a well-developed understanding of ",
  "statecraft and diplomacy. In his classical treatise Arthashastra, ",
  "Kautilya listed six measures of foreign policy (sadgunya)\u2014",
  "(a) policy of peace (samdhi); (b) policy of hostility (vigraha); ",
  "(c)  policy  of  keeping  quiet  (asana);  (d)  marching  on  an ",
  "expedition (yana); ( ) seeking another\u2019s protection (samsraya); ",
  "and ( f ) a dual policy of seeking peace with one and waging war ",
  "against another (dvaidhibhava). Alongside the six policies, ",
  "Kautilya also mentions the four techniques (chatur upayay) ",
  "namely  (a)  Sama  or  the  use  of  friendliness,  persuasion, ",
  "polite argument or reason; ( ) Dana or the resort to gifts, ",
  "concessions or compromises; (c) Bheda or the fomenting of ",
  "discord, dissensions and divisions through use of propaganda ",
  "and other means and (d) Danda or the use of force when all ",
  "else fails. These lessons of statecraft did serve India well. For ",
  "more than a millennium India was a sophisticated, well-run ",
  "State. However, security and wealth bred complacency and ",
  "arrogance. India stagnated and ossi\ufb01 ed. It fell an easy prey to ",
  "invaders, its spirit was crushed, its self-con\ufb01 dence destroyed.",
  "When it gained Independence in 1947, India had what ",
  "Prime Minister Nehru called its \u2018tryst with destiny\u2019. This has ",
  "now become an open \ufb02 irtation. Will India\u2019s relationship with ",
  "destiny be consummated? It can be, provided there is a change ",
  "of mindset among India\u2019s leaders and its people. There can be ",
  "no place for a chalta hai or \u2018anything goes\u2019 attitude. Aspiring ",
  "to become a great power, India will have to behave like one. Its ",
  "diplomacy will have to be imaginative and skilful, guided by ",
  "hard-nosed national interest, and tempered with morality and ",
  "ethics. The challenge before India is to formulate and conduct ",
  "an independent foreign policy in the decades ahead so that it ",
  "does indeed live up to its own expectations and those of the ",
  "world. India\u2019s foreign policy must get back to its moorings, ",
  "from which India has drifted over the last decade or so. There ",
  "are no short cuts. Piggybacking strategies are futile. Based on ",
  "an objective evaluation of India\u2019s resources and comparative  300 CHALLENGE AND STRATEGY ",
  "advantages, India must have a clear grand strategic design. ",
  "Tactics can, and must, be continually reviewed and revised. ",
  "India must have self-con\ufb01 dence in its destiny, determinedly ",
  "follow clear-headed policies without being pushed around, ",
  "and  work  purposefully  to  build  the  required  institutional ",
  "structures and public support to sustain its ambitions. Only ",
  "then can India forge ahead and transform its much vaunted ",
  "\u2018potential\u2019 into the reality of a strong, prosperous and globally ",
  "in\ufb02 uential country.Select Bibliography",
