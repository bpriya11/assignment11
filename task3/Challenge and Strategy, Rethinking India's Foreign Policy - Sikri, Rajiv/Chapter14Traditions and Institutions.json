  "A",
  " lthough  the  Indian  civilization  is  old,  the",
  " Indian nation is young. Ironically, it is India\u2019s",
  " experience  under  colonial  rule  that  created ",
  "the idea of India as a modern nation. Macaulay\u2019s educational ",
  "reforms were intended to create an Indian elite who, cut off ",
  "from the deep roots of their own rich heritage of culture and ",
  "achievements,  would  become  loyal  subjects  of  the  British ",
  "Empire. Macaulay\u2019s strategy did succeed, perhaps more than ",
  "he envisaged. An unintended outcome of educating Indians ",
  "was the rise of Indian nationalism. The Indian elite educated ",
  "in the Western mould drew inspiration from the great ideas ",
  "of nationalism, communism and socialism that were sweeping ",
  "across Europe in the second half of the 19th and the \ufb01 rst half ",
  "of the 20th centuries. There were also warning lessons to be ",
  "learnt from the fascist tendencies in Germany and Italy.",
  "Infl uence of Nehru and Gandhi",
  "Jawaharlal Nehru, who became India\u2019s \ufb01 rst Prime Minister and ",
  "Minister of External Affairs, played the main role in shaping ",
  "India\u2019s foreign policy. Nehru\u2019s understanding of history and ",
  "knowledge of foreign affairs was unmatched among indepen-",
  "dent India\u2019s \ufb01 rst generation of leaders. His Western education ",
  "and  personal  familiarity  with  different  European  political ",
  "movements and trends deeply in\ufb02 uenced his thinking and gave TRADITIONS AND INSTITUTIONS 259",
  "him a valuable grounding in foreign affairs. Even before India ",
  "became independent, he had deeply re\ufb02 ected on important ",
  "foreign policy matters and had a clear farsighted vision for ",
  "an Independent India. It was only natural, therefore, that his ",
  "ideas and theories provided the crucial inputs and guidance for ",
  "India\u2019s foreign policy when India became independent. ",
  "Alongside Nehru, Mahatma Gandhi\u2019s thinking and philo-",
  "sophy had a signi\ufb01 cant, although insuf\ufb01 ciently appreciated, ",
  "in\ufb02 uence on India\u2019s foreign policy. The essential elements of ",
  "Gandhi\u2019s philosophy were the concepts of non-violence, the ",
  "importance of the moral dimension in the conduct of men ",
  "as well as nations, and Satyagraha or the struggle for truth, ",
  "compassion and justice. Gandhi\u2019s thinking was in\ufb02 uenced by ",
  "the moral, ethical and philosophical precepts of Indian holy ",
  "books and scriptures like the Ramayana and Mahabharata ",
  "as well as the teachings of Lord Buddha. At a conceptual and ",
  "intellectual level, India\u2019s freedom struggle was not just about ",
  "gaining India\u2019s freedom from British rule, but part of a wider ",
  "global anti-colonial movement. This internationalist aspect of ",
  "India\u2019s movement for independence emanated from Gandhi\u2019s ",
  "own encounters with racism in South Africa, which contributed ",
  "to the understanding among Congress leaders that India\u2019s own ",
  "freedom was linked to that of people suffering under colonial ",
  "rule elsewhere in the world.",
  "It is therefore hardly surprising that from the very begin-",
  "ning,  India\u2019s  foreign  policy  concerned  itself  not  only  with ",
  "India\u2019s narrow national interests, but also how it would impact ",
  "other colonies in Asia and Africa. The de\ufb01 ning characteristics ",
  "of India\u2019s foreign policy in the \ufb01 rst few decades after India\u2019s ",
  "independence were: non-alignment, or the right to follow an ",
  "independent foreign policy and to decide foreign policy issues ",
  "on merit; moral, diplomatic and economic support for the ",
  "struggle against colonialism, racialism, apartheid and other ",
  "forms of discrimination; non-violence and the quest for nuclear ",
  "disarmament and India\u2019s role as an international peacemaker. ",
  "India\u2019s position on world issues was informed by moral clarity ",
  "and courage, which won India many admirers, made India the ",
  "leader of the developing countries, and gave it an in\ufb02 uence in ",
  "world affairs out of proportion to its real economic and political  260 CHALLENGE AND STRATEGY ",
  "strength. At the same time, India\u2019s moralistic posturing as well ",
  "as its air of self-importance and self-righteousness irritated the ",
  "Western countries.",
  "The internationalist perspective in India\u2019s foreign policy ",
  "has served India\u2019s broader national interests. Would India ",
  "have survived as a united, sovereign and independent State ",
  "if it alone had been decolonized? Undoubtedly, the spread ",
  "of the movement against colonialism and racism, leading to ",
  "the emergence of large numbers of independent countries, ",
  "buttressed  India\u2019s  own  independence.  The  pride  and  self-",
  "respect that Gandhi engendered among the people of India ",
  "gave  India  the  moral  courage  to  stand  up  and  follow  an ",
  "independent foreign policy rather than submit to pressures to ",
  "join one of the Cold War blocs. This has stood India well. It ",
  "has consistently remained a de\ufb01 ning feature of India\u2019s foreign ",
  "policy for over six decades. So deep-rooted and widespread is ",
  "the conviction that an independent foreign policy is the right ",
  "policy for India to follow that no Government in India can ",
  "openly call for any change in approach.",
  "India\u2019s foreign policy institutions and traditions neces-",
  "sarily carry the stamp of Jawaharlal Nehru, who conceptualized ",
  "and executed India\u2019s foreign policy for the \ufb01 rst 17 years after ",
  "India\u2019s independence. No less important is the fact that he ",
  "trained and inspired a generation of Indian diplomats who ",
  "shaped India\u2019s foreign policy during the remaining part of the ",
  "20th century. Under Nehru, India strutted on the world stage. ",
  "Its lofty voice was a standing feature of important international ",
  "gatherings.  In  India\u2019s  diplomatic  traditions,  multilateral ",
  "diplomacy  acquired  an  aura  that  was  denied  to  hardcore ",
  "bilateral diplomacy. Indian diplomats became experts in trying ",
  "to work out compromise positions than to playing hardball to ",
  "preserve and promote India\u2019s national interests. Diplomats ",
  "gave more attention to elegant formulations on paper than to ",
  "the substantive outcome of negotiations.",
  "Nehru\u2019s foreign policy style was personalized. He remained ",
  "his own Minister of External Affairs, interacting directly with ",
  "the of\ufb01 cials of the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA), at the ",
  "head of which was the unique, newly created post of Secretary ",
  "General. The Cabinet as a whole did not exert much in\ufb02 uence TRADITIONS AND INSTITUTIONS 261",
  "on foreign policy. Just one Minister, Defence Minister Krishna ",
  "Menon, shared Nehru\u2019s burden of guiding foreign and defence ",
  "policy. As the Indian Foreign Service was very new, India had ",
  "no trained and experienced professional diplomats who could ",
  "advise  Nehru.  Nehru\u2019s  political  interaction  was  extensive, ",
  "but his approach was explanatory and exhortatory, not open-",
  "minded. His utterances and writings\u2014speeches in Parliament, ",
  "letters to the Chief Ministers, statements during his visits ",
  "abroad  and  when  dignitaries  visited  India\u2014were  long  and ",
  "rambling, combining considerable practical wisdom with theo-",
  "retical and philosophical musings. At times he was na\u00efve and ",
  "unrealistic. It is very likely that if the thinking represented by ",
  "revolutionaries like Bhagat Singh, Veer Savarkar and Subhash ",
  "Chandra Bose or even of Sardar Patel had had greater in\ufb02 uence ",
  "on India\u2019s Gandhi-inspired and Nehru-directed foreign policy, ",
  "it would have been imbued with a greater dose of realpolitik.",
  "The personalized conduct of foreign policy is one of Nehru\u2019s ",
  "enduring  legacies.  Nehru\u2019s  personal  rapport  with  many  of ",
  "the world\u2019s leaders was undoubtedly genuine and sometimes ",
  "effective, but it meant that insuf\ufb01 cient attention was paid to the ",
  "development of institutions for the conduct of foreign policy. ",
  "Subsequent Indian leaders have similarly tried to conduct ",
  "Indian foreign policy on a personalized basis. To this day, ",
  "Indian leaders delude themselves that foreign policy successes, ",
  "both real and imagined, are due to a magical \u2018personal rapport\u2019 ",
  "they enjoy with foreign leaders. ",
  "Post-Nehru Evolution",
  "Lal Bahadur Shastri was in of\ufb01 ce for too short a period to ",
  "make  any  meaningful  contribution  to  the  development  of ",
  "foreign  policy  institutions.  Indira  Gandhi  continued  the ",
  "personalized approach of her father, and made the dubious ",
  "contribution of undermining the weak foreign policy insti-",
  "tutions she had inherited. Her approach was informed by two ",
  "factors, namely the Bangladesh crisis of 1971, and her concept ",
  "of a \u2018committed\u2019 civil service. It was during her time that the  262 CHALLENGE AND STRATEGY ",
  "of\ufb01 ce of the prime minister became a source of enormous ",
  "power. In foreign policy, she exercised control through her ",
  "Principal Secretary, P.N. Haksar, who was originally from the ",
  "Indian Foreign Service, and D.P. Dhar, Chairman of a newly ",
  "set up and extremely powerful Policy Planning Committee in ",
  "the MEA. Bypassing the Minister of External Affairs of the day, ",
  "Dhar oversaw the Bangladesh operations and relations with ",
  "the Soviet Union. Personalized decision-making cost India ",
  "dearly in the 1972 Shimla Agreement, where Indira Gandhi ",
  "relied on her personal instincts and close advisers rather than ",
  "impartial professional advice to cut an unsatisfactory deal with ",
  "Pakistan\u2019s Prime Minister, Zul\ufb01 kar Ali Bhutto. The position of ",
  "the Chairman, Policy Planning Committee was subsequently ",
  "dismantled, only to be revived during Indira Gandhi\u2019s second ",
  "term of of\ufb01 ce when G. Parthasarathi, another loyalist, was ",
  "appointed to this post.",
  "Rajiv Gandhi too had an imperious style. In foreign affairs, ",
  "he  relied  less  on  the  established  institutional  structures ",
  "and  chain  of  command,  and  more  on  the  of\ufb01 cials  in  his ",
  "own of\ufb01 ce. During his tenure, the Prime Minister\u2019s Of\ufb01 ce ",
  "became unprecedentedly powerful, with middle level of\ufb01 cials ",
  "exercising power that far exceeded their formal position in the ",
  "bureaucratic hierarchy. At times, Rajiv Gandhi himself held ",
  "the of\ufb01 ce of Minister of External Affairs. When he did not, he ",
  "made sure that the incumbent did not step out of line. The ",
  "role and the importance of the MEA was greatly reduced, its ",
  "established hierarchies disrupted. If Rajiv Gandhi\u2019s most blatant ",
  "move was to give effective responsibility for certain aspects of ",
  "foreign policy to the Secretary of a Ministry (Information and ",
  "Broadcasting) that had nothing to do with foreign policy, his ",
  "most cavalier one, with tragic long-term consequences, was the ",
  "public sacking of the Foreign Secretary in 1987.",
  "Sonia Gandhi, the Chairperson of the UPA, has continued ",
  "the  Nehru\u2013Gandhi  legacy  of  personalized  foreign  policy ",
  "formulation  and  execution.  \u2018Loyalty\u2019  to  the  Nehru\u2013Gandhi ",
  "family is the watchword. In Nehru\u2019s time, it is understandable ",
  "that  many  public  \ufb01 gures  should  have  been  appointed  as ",
  "Heads of Mission to important world capitals both as political ",
  "patronage and in view of the fact that there were not enough TRADITIONS AND INSTITUTIONS 263",
  "suitably quali\ufb01 ed senior career of\ufb01 cers who could \ufb01 t the bill. ",
  "All subsequent prime ministers, including Indira Gandhi and ",
  "Rajiv Gandhi, were content to let career diplomats man most of ",
  "the crucial posts abroad. The UPA Government, however, has ",
  "shown itself to be egregiously prone to cronyism.",
  "Policy Formulation\u2014Structures and Infl uences",
  "One  dif\ufb01 culty  in  institutionalizing  foreign  policy  in  any ",
  "country is that the chief executive of the government, the ",
  "prime minister in India\u2019s case, necessarily has to get intimately ",
  "involved in foreign policy matters. As India\u2019s standing in the ",
  "world has improved, so have the visibility and the international ",
  "commitments of its Prime Minister. This makes the relationship ",
  "between the Prime Minister and the Minister of External Affairs ",
  "a delicate one, particularly if the External Affairs Minister is a ",
  "political heavyweight. However, it is in the very nature of things ",
  "that it is the Prime Minister, particularly one experienced and ",
  "interested in foreign affairs, who ultimately determines the ",
  "extent of leeway and freedom of action given to the Minister of ",
  "External Affairs. ",
  "India\u2019s experience has been that prime ministers belonging ",
  "to the Congress Party, whether from the Nehru\u2013Gandhi family ",
  "or not, have exercised more decisive control of foreign policy ",
  "than non-Congress prime ministers. P.V. Narasimha Rao, who ",
  "had earlier served as Minister of External Affairs, gave a de\ufb01 nite ",
  "strategic direction to India\u2019s foreign policy in the early 1990s. ",
  "For a person who had neither any previous experience nor any ",
  "known interest in foreign affairs, Prime Minister Manmohan ",
  "Singh has been surprisingly assertive\u2014 and controversial. This ",
  "is seen in his single-minded keenness, almost obsession, with ",
  "the India\u2013US nuclear deal, for the sake of which he not only ",
  "kept the post of Minister of External Affairs with himself for ",
  "nearly a year, but also staked the future of his government. ",
  "Even after a very senior and experienced minister, Pranab ",
  "Mukherjee, was appointed Minister of External Affairs, the ",
  "overall control of the relationship with the US remains with the  264 CHALLENGE AND STRATEGY ",
  "Prime Minister. The new phenomenon in the UPA Government ",
  "has been the in\ufb02 uence, often decisive, of players who are not ",
  "formally part of the government. These include the Chairperson ",
  "of the UPA and parties like the Left and the Samajwadi Party, ",
  "on whom the government relies for support. ",
  "On the other hand, non-Congress prime ministers have ",
  "tended to give a little more slack to the ministers of External ",
  "Affairs. During Morarji Desai\u2019s tenure as Prime Minister, Atal ",
  "Bihari Vajpayee was a powerful Foreign Minister. Similarly, ",
  "during the governments of V.P. Singh and H.D. Devegowda, ",
  "I.K. Gujral effectively ran foreign policy. As Prime Minister, ",
  "Atal Bihari Vajpayee concerned himself only with the broad ",
  "strategic  vision  and  was  content  to  give  External  Affairs ",
  "Ministers Jaswant Singh and Yashwant Sinha a relatively free ",
  "hand in foreign policy.",
  "The most important institutional mechanism for the Prime ",
  "Minister is to exercise control over his own of\ufb01 ce. Since the ",
  "time of Rajiv Gandhi, the Prime Minister\u2019s Of\ufb01 ce, whose foreign ",
  "affairs component has vastly expanded, exercises more direct ",
  "control over foreign policy. From 1998 onwards, the National ",
  "Security Adviser (NSA), who has unrestricted access to the ",
  "Prime Minister, supervises matters relating to foreign affairs in ",
  "the Prime Minister\u2019s Of\ufb01 ce. He also controls and coordinates ",
  "work  relating  to  the  Ministries  of  Defence,  Home,  Space, ",
  "Atomic Energy, as well as the various intelligence agencies. ",
  "Currently  two  Deputy  NSAs,  at  least  a  couple  of  Foreign ",
  "Service of\ufb01 cers in the Prime Minister\u2019s Of\ufb01 ce, as well as a full-",
  "\ufb02 edged dedicated National Security Council Secretariat assist ",
  "him in this task. In this way, the NSA has emerged as a very ",
  "powerful \ufb01 gure behind the scenes on foreign policy issues, ",
  "even though he need not necessarily have any background or ",
  "expertise in foreign affairs. Unencumbered, on the one hand, ",
  "by the demands of protocol, of formal meetings with visiting ",
  "dignitaries, of public appearances, of Parliament and political ",
  "work, and armed, on the other hand, with information on ",
  "nuclear, space and intelligence matters to which only the Prime ",
  "Minister is often privy, the NSA has much more time for, and ",
  "control over, foreign policy formulation and supervision than ",
  "the Minister of External Affairs. He also has the advantage that TRADITIONS AND INSTITUTIONS 265",
  "he is not accountable to either the Parliament or the public\u2014",
  "in fact to no one except his political bosses. Thus there is an ",
  "inbuilt con\ufb02 ict of interest between the NSA and the External ",
  "Affairs Minister, which has frequently come out in the open ",
  "since the setting up of the of\ufb01 ce of the NSA in 1998.",
  "While it is the Prime Minister or the External Affairs ",
  "Minister who are concerned with the day-to-day conduct of ",
  "foreign policy, the Indian political structure has institutions ",
  "to ensure that there is no arbitrariness in the conduct of ",
  "foreign policy. These are both within the government and ",
  "through Parliament. In the government, most major foreign ",
  "policy decisions are taken through deliberations of various ",
  "committees of the Cabinet, the most important of which, as ",
  "far as foreign affairs is concerned, is the Cabinet Committee ",
  "on Security. This Committee, headed by the Prime Minister, ",
  "has as its members the Home Minister, the Defence Minister, ",
  "the External Affairs Minister, the Finance Minister and the ",
  "NSA. Decisions are invariably arrived at by consensus, and ",
  "in practice the Prime Minister can often steer the outcome of ",
  "such meetings in the direction he desires. Matters where a wider ",
  "gamut of political consultations is deemed necessary could be ",
  "referred to the Cabinet Committee on Political Affairs, or the ",
  "full Cabinet if need be. If a matter is particularly knotty, then ",
  "it is open for the Prime Minister to set up a smaller informal ",
  "committee, or a Group of Ministers, to look into the issue ",
  "in greater detail and report back to the Cabinet Committee ",
  "on Security or the Cabinet Committee on Political Affairs. ",
  "The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs or the Cabinet ",
  "Committee on WTO matters deliberates over some foreign ",
  "policy issues with an economic angle, though one problem ",
  "here is that the Minister of External Affairs is not always a ",
  "member of these Cabinet committees. Since 2005, in an effort ",
  "to generate a consensus among key stakeholders and to fast-",
  "track decision-making on knotty and controversial issues (in ",
  "particular  FTAs  and  WTO  negotiations)  involving  India\u2019s ",
  "economic relations with foreign countries, the government ",
  "has  set  up  a  Trade  and  Economic  Relations  Committee ",
  "(TERC),  where  the  key  concerned  Ministers  of  External ",
  "Affairs, Finance, and Commerce and Industry, the Deputy  266 CHALLENGE AND STRATEGY ",
  "Chairman of the Planning Commission, the Chairman of the ",
  "Economic Advisory Council and the Chairman of the National ",
  "Manufacturing Competitiveness Council are members.",
  "Individual Ministers also hold, on an ad hoc basis, smaller ",
  "meetings with other Cabinet colleagues or senior of\ufb01 cials from ",
  "other ministries/departments. The Minister of Defence, for ",
  "example, holds weekly or fortnightly meetings in which the ",
  "Cabinet Secretary, the National Security Adviser, the Chiefs of ",
  "the Army, Navy and Air Force, the secretaries in the various ",
  "departments of the Defence Ministry, as well as the Foreign ",
  "Secretary and the Home Secretary participate. At the bureau-",
  "cratic level, issues that involve many ministries and departments ",
  "are discussed in meetings of the Committee of Secretaries headed ",
  "by the Cabinet Secretary. This ensures that the inputs from all ",
  "the  relevant  ministries/departments  are  available  on  any ",
  "particular issue. The National Security Adviser or the Principal ",
  "Secretary to the Prime Minister sometimes calls meetings on ",
  "speci\ufb01 c issues where the Prime Minister has a special interest. ",
  "Key  secretaries  concerned  with  foreign  policy  matters  in ",
  "ministries like External Affairs, Home, Defence, Commerce ",
  "and Finance and Intelligence Bureau and the Research and ",
  "Analysis  Wing  also  sometimes  hold  informal  meetings  to ",
  "resolve an issue. All these mechanisms are extremely valuable, ",
  "indeed essential, for harmonizing the positions of different ",
  "stakeholders in the government before formal decisions are ",
  "taken by the concerned minister, the Prime Minister or the ",
  "Cabinet.",
  "There are inbuilt mechanisms, though not all of them work ",
  "satisfactorily,  for  parliamentary  oversight  of  foreign  policy ",
  "too. The Standing Committee of Parliament for the MEA that ",
  "includes Members of Parliament from different parties meets ",
  "twice or thrice a year. The Foreign Secretary, assisted by his ",
  "of\ufb01 cers, has personally to answer the queries that members ",
  "may  have  on  the  functioning  of  the  MEA.  The  Standing ",
  "Committee also examines in detail the MEA budget proposals. ",
  "Then there is the Consultative Committee of Parliament on ",
  "External Affairs, where the Minister of External Affairs, assisted ",
  "by his Ministers of State and senior of\ufb01 cials, responds to ",
  "queries, clari\ufb01 cations and observations made by the Members ",
  "of Parliament on foreign policy issues. Typically, one issue is TRADITIONS AND INSTITUTIONS 267",
  "selected for in-depth discussion, but it is open to the members ",
  "to raise any foreign policy issue of interest or concern to them. ",
  "Parliamentary oversight is also done through questions raised ",
  "by Members of Parliament in the Lok Sabha or the Rajya Sabha. ",
  "On important issues, the government explains its position in ",
  "short-duration discussions, longer debates (mostly without ",
  "voting), suo moto statements, responses to calling attention ",
  "notices, zero hour questions, and so on. Unfortunately, the ",
  "level of parliamentary interest in foreign affairs has steadily ",
  "declined, in contrast to the situation a few decades ago. This ",
  "has weakened parliamentary oversight over foreign affairs, ",
  "which is a pity, since foreign policy impacts many other areas ",
  "of governance.",
  "In a parliamentary system of democracy like India\u2019s, there ",
  "is a convention that Parliament does not have to approve or ",
  "ratify treaties or agreements signed by the government with ",
  "foreign countries. Such a practice is based on the premise that, ",
  "as it enjoys majority support in the Lok Sabha, the government ",
  "has the support of Parliament for its actions in all \ufb01 elds, ",
  "including foreign policy. However, recently in the case of the ",
  "India\u2013US nuclear deal this practice has been questioned by ",
  "both the Left parties, which were supporting the government ",
  "from outside, as well as by the Opposition Bharatiya Janata ",
  "Party. Their argument has been that on important issues that ",
  "have long-term consequences for the country the government ",
  "should  not  be  allowed  to  take  policy  decisions  without ",
  "Parliamentary  scrutiny  and  approval.  Even  though  it  goes ",
  "against precedent, a change in the current practice would ",
  "seem to be desirable in situations where a minority coalition ",
  "government is in power. This would ensure that foreign policy ",
  "re\ufb02 ects the prevailing political consensus in India.",
  "The  parliamentary  systems  and  procedures  that  India ",
  "inherited from the British system have necessarily had to be ",
  "adapted  to  the  conditions  under  which  Indian  democracy ",
  "functions. One mechanism that has been used from time to ",
  "time, including in the \ufb01 eld of foreign policy, to tackle dif\ufb01 cult ",
  "situations,  is  the  constitution  of  all-party  committees  to ",
  "examine a knotty issue on which there is no national consensus. ",
  "This was successfully used by former prime minister Vajpayee  268 CHALLENGE AND STRATEGY ",
  "on the issue of sending Indian troops to Iraq in 2003. Under ",
  "great pressure from the US as well as from many within his ",
  "own party to send troops, Vajpayee instinctively felt that this ",
  "might not be a good idea, both for his party and for India\u2019s ",
  "national interests. He therefore hit upon the stratagem of ",
  "convening  an  all-party  Joint  Parliamentary  Committee  to ",
  "consider the issue, and managed to wriggle out of a dif\ufb01 cult ",
  "situation\u2014in  retrospect,  an  extremely  prudent  decision. ",
  "Similarly, although the UPA Government also used such a ",
  "tactic to postpone the SAARC summit in 2006, it refused to do ",
  "so on highly controversial and divisive issues such as India\u2019s ",
  "vote in the IAEA on Iran\u2019s nuclear programme, as well as on ",
  "the India\u2013US nuclear deal. In general its preference has been ",
  "to conduct foreign policy on its own, rather than by trying to ",
  "build a broad political consensus.",
  "Such an approach is problematic. India has come a long ",
  "way from Nehru\u2019s time when the Congress Party\u2019s control of ",
  "the Central Government and most of the states ensured that ",
  "there would be no serious dissenting political voices on foreign ",
  "policy decisions taken by the Central Government. Today, the ",
  "coalition partners of the Congress are regional parties, whose ",
  "in\ufb02 uence does not extend beyond one or two states and whose ",
  "perspective on foreign policy is dictated by local considerations ",
  "and interests rather than a broader national perspective. The ",
  "same holds true for the Bharatiya Janata Party that led the ",
  "NDA-coalition of similar regional parties. So far, in the coali-",
  "tion governments they have headed, neither the Congress nor ",
  "the Bharatiya Janata Party have given up control of the portfolio ",
  "of the Minister of External Affairs to any other party. This state ",
  "of affairs may not last forever, and it may become necessary ",
  "to evolve new mechanisms to deal with a situation where the ",
  "Minister of External Affairs is a person from a regional party ",
  "that has a narrow foreign policy perspective.",
  "In practice many foreign policy choices and outcomes are ",
  "heavily in\ufb02 uenced by the predilections of state governments, ",
  "particularly in respect of neighbouring foreign countries with ",
  "which they have common borders. As an example, it was only ",
  "through the intercession of the then Chief Minister of West ",
  "Bengal that India and Bangladesh could sign the agreement on ",
  "sharing the Ganga waters. India\u2019s Sri Lanka policy continues TRADITIONS AND INSTITUTIONS 269",
  "to be hobbled by the virtual veto that Tamil Nadu politicians ",
  "exercise on giving enhanced levels of military assistance to the ",
  "Sri Lankan government to deal with the LTTE. India\u2019s attitude ",
  "towards Myanmar is dictated in large part by considerations of ",
  "the development and security of the Northeast states; Sikkim ",
  "and Arunachal Pradesh take a great interest in India\u2019s relations ",
  "with China; while India\u2019s policy towards Pakistan is in\ufb02 uenced ",
  "by what Jammu and Kashmir and Punjab think. In short, ",
  "the  states  have  become  important  stakeholders  in  India\u2019s ",
  "foreign policy and therefore have to be treated as such by the ",
  "government in New Delhi. It is in recognition of this reality that ",
  "over the last few years the MEA has opened of\ufb01 ces in a number ",
  "of state capitals and the recently set up Public Diplomacy ",
  "Division has started an outreach programme there.",
  "Ministry of External Aff airs (MEA)",
  "Within the Central Government, the MEA is the principal ",
  "institution concerned with the conduct of foreign policy. As ",
  "the administrative head of the MEA, the head of the Indian ",
  "Foreign Service (IFS), and the principal foreign policy adviser ",
  "to the government, the Foreign Secretary wields great power ",
  "and in\ufb02 uence. His position carries considerable prestige and ",
  "public visibility. Technically, the Foreign Secretary reports ",
  "to the Minister of External Affairs. But a lot of the Foreign ",
  "Secretary\u2019s work brings him in direct and frequent contact ",
  "with the Prime Minister. Moreover, it is through the Foreign ",
  "Secretary that the Prime Minister ensures that his policies are ",
  "faithfully implemented by the MEA and the vast network of ",
  "Missions and Posts abroad. Thus, the post of Foreign Secretary ",
  "is one of the few appointments at the Secretary level in the ",
  "Government of India where the Prime Minister takes an active ",
  "interest.",
  "Against this background, it is not surprising that the post ",
  "of Foreign Secretary has become progressively more politicized ",
  "and has been frequently mired in controversies, particularly ",
  "over the last three decades or so. Three Foreign Secretaries ",
  "have been removed from of\ufb01 ce before the end of their respective  270 CHALLENGE AND STRATEGY ",
  "terms; six have been given extensions in service; and, contrary ",
  "to the practice in other government organizations and services, ",
  "on  several  occasions  the  Foreign  Secretary  appointed  has ",
  "superseded several of\ufb01 cers. Such cavalier treatment of the of\ufb01 ce ",
  "of Foreign Secretary by successive governments, particularly the ",
  "present UPA Government, has seriously damaged the effective ",
  "functioning of the MEA, as well as undermined the integrity and ",
  "cohesiveness of its structure. The Foreign Secretary is required ",
  "to administer the MEA with fairness, equity and justice. The ",
  "problem is that a Foreign Secretary who is too beholden to ",
  "political masters may lack the moral authority, perhaps even ",
  "the will, to do so.",
  "One severe shortcoming of this larger-than-life role of the ",
  "Foreign Secretary has been that the MEA, a large sprawling ",
  "organization with multifarious functions and responsible for ",
  "the functioning of more than 160 Missions and Posts abroad, ",
  "is not structured and run in accordance with professional ",
  "management principles. Decision-making at the top is not ",
  "collective  or  consensual,  but  personalized.  Most  Foreign ",
  "Secretaries have functioned like a frenetic one-man band, not ",
  "an orchestra conductor. They have tended to pursue a personal ",
  "rather than a well-thought out collective agenda. Trying to keep ",
  "under their control areas of work that they consider important, ",
  "or simply to put their stamp on the MEA, Foreign Secretaries ",
  "have frequently added or given up countries and areas of direct ",
  "responsibility, whimsically carved up divisions, created new ",
  "ones, or simply renamed them! The globe in their vision has ",
  "become like a Swiss cheese, with holes in those places where ",
  "the Foreign Secretary has chosen to bite! This has also lead to ",
  "absurd situations where the Foreign Secretary handles rela-",
  "tions with France and the United Kingdom (presumably on the ",
  "ground that they are Permanent Members of the UN Security ",
  "Council)  but  not  Germany  or  the  European  Union!  Many ",
  "Foreign Secretaries have fallen between two stools\u2014unable to ",
  "give suf\ufb01 cient attention either to the areas under their direct ",
  "charge, or to the onerous responsibility of supervision and ",
  "coordination of MEA\u2019s functioning.",
  "In addition to the Foreign Secretary, there are two or three ",
  "other secretaries in the MEA who have their own independent ",
  "areas of responsibility and report not to the Foreign Secretary TRADITIONS AND INSTITUTIONS 271",
  "but  to  the  Minister  of  External  Affairs.  The  position  of ",
  "Secretary is one of considerable prestige and responsibility. ",
  "Secretaries in MEA give critically important inputs for policy ",
  "formulation, and are the highest of\ufb01 cial level negotiators and ",
  "interlocutors with foreign governments. They are members of ",
  "the Foreign Service Board and the Departmental Promotion ",
  "Committee  that  are  entrusted  with  the  responsibility  of ",
  "recommending appointments and promotions at higher levels. ",
  "Not all Grade I Foreign Service of\ufb01 cers are considered suitable ",
  "for appointment as Secretary in the MEA. A successful tenure ",
  "as Secretary in the MEA has traditionally been considered an ",
  "important assignment that has frequently been a stepping-stone ",
  "to appointment as Foreign Secretary. But the controversial ",
  "manner in which Foreign Secretaries have been frequently ",
  "appointed in recent years has regrettably devalued the position ",
  "of MEA Secretaries, and only reinforced the prevailing mindset ",
  "among IFS of\ufb01 cers that it is better to be an Ambassador abroad ",
  "in one of the \u2018important\u2019 Embassies rather than be a Secretary ",
  "or Additional Secretary at headquarters. This can hardly be a ",
  "satisfactory state of affairs for the Foreign Of\ufb01 ce of a country ",
  "like India that has multifarious interests and a presence in all ",
  "parts of the world and aspires to become a Permanent Member ",
  "of the UN Security Council.",
  "Successive Foreign Secretaries have to bear much of the ",
  "responsibility  for  the  progressive  devaluation  of  high-level ",
  "posts  in  MEA.  The  charges,  even  the  designations,  of  the ",
  "other Secretaries and Additional Secretaries in the MEA have ",
  "frequently  been  changed  by  the  government.  Selection  of ",
  "of\ufb01 cers for working at headquarters, sometimes even for key ",
  "assignments, is often arbitrary and personalized, and it is not ",
  "unusual for of\ufb01 cers having no previous experience of the area of ",
  "work to be entrusted with the position of Head of the Division. ",
  "Regrettably all too often, some Joint Secretaries, and at times ",
  "even Secretaries and Additional Secretaries, in the MEA are ",
  "given ad hoc and rather light responsibilities. Contrary to the ",
  "practice in the rest of the Government of India, a new practice ",
  "has been followed in the MEA since the early 1990s whereby ",
  "the Minister of External Affairs can make appointments of  272 CHALLENGE AND STRATEGY ",
  "Additional Secretaries and Joint Secretaries in MEA without ",
  "the approval of the Appointments Committee of the Cabinet. ",
  "Such  tampering  with  MEA\u2019s  institutions  and  traditions ",
  "has  created  a  skewed  organizational  structure  that  breeds ",
  "frustration and creates inef\ufb01 ciencies.",
  "Unlike the Foreign Of\ufb01 ces of other major countries, MEA ",
  "does not have a large and in\ufb02 uential Policy Planning Division ",
  "that,  unburdened  by  day-to-day  tasks  and  preoccupations, ",
  "engages in long-term strategic thinking and forecasting by ",
  "taking a holistic view of foreign policy cutting across various ",
  "disciplines as well as territorial and functional charges. Given ",
  "the personalized style of running MEA that has become the ",
  "norm, it is not surprising that successive Ministers of External ",
  "Affairs and Foreign Secretaries have shied away from creating ",
  "a meaningful Policy Planning Division. Meanwhile valuable ",
  "manpower is kept idle or engaged in divisions having object-",
  "ively much lesser priority. The Historical and Research Division ",
  "too has steadily eroded into oblivion. More than six decades ",
  "after India\u2019s Independence there is, sadly, still no established ",
  "framework of foreign policy planning, and it is left to a handful ",
  "of politicians and bureaucrats who \ufb01 nd themselves in seats of ",
  "power to take decisions based on their gut feelings and personal ",
  "prejudices  instead  of  relying  on  well-reasoned  alternatives ",
  "projected to them by a professional policy planning structure.",
  "One of MEA\u2019s fundamental structural \ufb02 aws is that, for ",
  "the work expected of it, it is extremely poorly staffed at head-",
  "quarters and in Missions abroad. The government seems to ",
  "have \ufb01 nally realized that MEA and Missions/Posts abroad need ",
  "expansion to take care of India\u2019s fast increasing international ",
  "pro\ufb01 le and responsibilities. Problems will, however, remain ",
  "in the immediate future. It requires considerable lead-time ",
  "to train of\ufb01 cers, and a higher level of recruitment today will ",
  "take a few years to show any positive effect. Moreover, this ",
  "increased intake is counterbalanced by the tendency of an ",
  "increasing number of of\ufb01 cers to take early retirement from ",
  "the government as greener pastures in the private sector or ",
  "in international organizations lure them away. There are also ",
  "inherent tendencies within the Indian government that militate TRADITIONS AND INSTITUTIONS 273",
  "against good management. One is the politically correct urge to ",
  "cut down posts regardless of objective requirements. Another ",
  "is bureaucratic inertia.",
  "The pity is that even the meagre human resources that ",
  "MEA has, are not optimally deployed. MEA\u2019s functioning is too ",
  "Mission-oriented. Normally, the Headquarters to Missions ratio ",
  "in most Foreign Of\ufb01 ces around the world is 1:2, but in the case ",
  "of the MEA it is more in the range of 1:3 or 1:4. There are just ",
  "not enough people at Headquarters to process and analyse the ",
  "information \ufb02 owing from Missions or Posts abroad as well as ",
  "from the media and other sources that have proliferated in this ",
  "information-overload age. Given the speed of communications ",
  "and the ubiquity of information thanks to the Internet and ",
  "round-the-clock electronic media, Missions no longer need to ",
  "spend too much energy on basic reporting of developments. ",
  "This should have led to some cutting down of staff in Missions ",
  "abroad and transferring the posts to Headquarters, but in ",
  "practice the reverse has happened. In personnel management, ",
  "much more attention is given to selection of personnel for ",
  "all categories of of\ufb01 cers and staff posted in Missions/Posts ",
  "abroad than to deployments at Headquarters, in which the ",
  "Minister of External Affairs and the Foreign Secretary enjoy ",
  "untrammelled discretion and patronage. There is no longer any ",
  "sanctity about the level of a particular post abroad. A Second ",
  "Secretary can replace a Counsellor, a Grade III of\ufb01 cer a Grade ",
  "I Head of Mission. The reverse is also true. Such practices tell ",
  "on morale.",
  "In the allocation of human resources to Missions/Posts ",
  "abroad, there is a de\ufb01 nite bias in favour of the West. All ",
  "diplomatic and consular posts in Africa and Latin America, and ",
  "to some extent even in Asia (as well as the divisions in the MEA ",
  "dealing with these area), are under-staffed compared to the ",
  "existing quantum and untapped potential of trade, economic ",
  "and consular work. India does not have senior Ambassadors ",
  "representing it in the Third World. India has recently opened ",
  "Missions in small European countries, which objectively occupy ",
  "a relatively low priority in India\u2019s foreign policy. By contrast, ",
  "it has no or at best poorly-staffed Missions in important but  274 CHALLENGE AND STRATEGY ",
  "dif\ufb01 cult countries in Africa and Latin America where Indian ",
  "public  and  private  sector  companies  have  made  sizeable ",
  "investments. In all these countries Indian diplomats need to ",
  "closely follow internal developments and build relations with ",
  "the major political players in order to protect India\u2019s interests ",
  "against unexpected political changes. ",
  "It is evident that the functioning of MEA, which remains ",
  "the main branch of the government dealing with foreign policy ",
  "issues,  and  India\u2019s  methods  of  diplomacy  need  an  urgent ",
  "review.",
  "Other Institutions and Mechanisms",
  "Increasingly complex foreign policy issues, many of which ",
  "have far-reaching domestic rami\ufb01 cations, can no longer be ",
  "handled within the traditional foreign policy framework or in a ",
  "fragmented and compartmentalized manner. The formulation ",
  "and conduct of India\u2019s foreign policy has to be an integrated ",
  "national  effort  using  all  available  institutional  and  human ",
  "resources. Within the government, apart from MEA, many ",
  "other ministries and departments handle foreign policy issues. ",
  "Ministries like Defence, Finance, Commerce, Overseas Indian ",
  "Affairs,  Water  Resources  and  Petroleum  and  Natural  Gas, ",
  "just to name a few, play critical roles in foreign policy. There ",
  "is an urgent need to have an institutionalized and much more ",
  "ef\ufb01 cient coordination mechanism among different branches of ",
  "the government. ",
  "At present there is no ef\ufb01 cient mechanism to take full ",
  "advantage of the considerable talent outside the government ",
  "for policy formulation. This is regrettable since contemporary ",
  "foreign policy tasks and challenges before India have become ",
  "far more complex and demanding, and the government\u2019s own ",
  "resources are not adequate. The only institutional mechanism ",
  "set up a few years ago is the National Security Advisory Board. ",
  "Its composition is broad-based, and its members are generally ",
  "persons of eminence and credibility. So far there is not much ",
  "evidence that it has provided signi\ufb01 cant policy inputs, or TRADITIONS AND INSTITUTIONS 275",
  "that its advice, when given, has been taken seriously by the ",
  "government. Its most relevant contribution has been the draft ",
  "Nuclear Doctrine. Thereafter, its importance seems to have ",
  "declined, and the National Security Advisory Board is used by ",
  "the government more to give some favoured retired of\ufb01 cials, ",
  "academics and journalists a sinecure than to genuinely use ",
  "the available expertise and scholarship among non-of\ufb01 cials in ",
  "foreign policy formulation. Another mechanism, used on an ",
  "ad hoc basis, is that of an Eminent Persons Group, comprising ",
  "experts from different disciplines, that has been set up with ",
  "some countries to provide jointly agreed recommendations ",
  "to  both  governments  for  policy  formulation.  Some  prime ",
  "ministers and ministers of External Affairs have relied on ",
  "\u2018Advisers\u2019 or \u2018Special Envoys\u2019 to handle speci\ufb01 c issues. The ",
  "Ministries  of  External  Affairs  and  Defence  do  support  a ",
  "handful of think tanks, and sometimes contract policy studies ",
  "from think tanks, universities and individuals, but this is ",
  "done on an ad hoc basis rather than as part of a systematic ",
  "programme. There are a few well-structured think tanks, but ",
  "far too many small personality-based out\ufb01 ts that have failed ",
  "to develop meaningful expertise in area studies. Apart from ",
  "one or two honourable exceptions, the private sector has not ",
  "deemed it worthwhile to support independent think tanks. ",
  "In the universities too, international affairs and the study ",
  "of foreign languages are not given adequate attention. Most ",
  "of India\u2019s strategic policy community is based in New Delhi. ",
  "While some commendable work is being done in other parts ",
  "of the country too, researchers and students there feel quite ",
  "disconnected from discussions at the Centre. There is an ",
  "urgent need to set up an extensive network of centres that ",
  "specialize in the study of different areas and countries.",
  "India aspires to be a great power in the world, but lacks ",
  "the required institutional structures and sophisticated systems ",
  "for  considered  foreign  policy  formulation  and  execution. ",
  "Obviously, no foreign policy initiative will be meaningful or ",
  "fruitful if it is conceived and executed as a purely diplomatic ",
  "exercise that is disconnected from India\u2019s domestic realities ",
  "and priorities. At the same time, India\u2019s strengths can be ",
  "leveraged abroad most effectively only if domestic stakeholders  276 CHALLENGE AND STRATEGY ",
  "have the bene\ufb01 t of a harmonious and coordinated diplomatic ",
  "effort. The government will have to give up its current \ufb01 re-",
  "\ufb01 ghting approach and know-all attitude. It will have to get over ",
  "the problem of lack of coordination in India\u2019s foreign policy ",
  "structures, and undertake a comprehensive revamping of the ",
  "institutional set-up for foreign policy. Only then will India be ",
  "able to play an effective role on the international stage in the ",
  "coming years.",
