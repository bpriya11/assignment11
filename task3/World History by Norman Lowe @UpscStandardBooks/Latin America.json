  "SUMMARY OF EVENTS",
  "The area known as Latin America consists of the countries of South America, Central",
  "America including Mexico,and islands in the Caribbean Sea such as Cuba, Jamaica and",
  "Hispaniola (see Map 26.1). The latter is divided into two states - Haiti and the",
  "Dominican Republic. These states gained their independence from Spain - in the case",
  "-",
  "of Brazil, from Portugal in the early nineteenth century, and they had much in",
  "common. Spanish is spoken in most of these countries, though in Brazil Portuguese is",
  "the main language. They all shared similar difficulties: they were underdeveloped both",
  "industrially and agriculturally, and they had massive problems of poverty and illiteracy",
  "and unstable political systems. Revolutions, coups and assassinations were common",
  "\u00ac",
  "place, and progress occurred only very slowly and unevenly. The USA provided",
  "economic aid for some of the states of Latin America, but its motives were not entirely",
  ".",
  "selfless In return the Americans expected to be able to exert political influence in order",
  "to prevent socialist or communist governments from gaining power. They had no hesi",
  "\u00ac",
  "tation in intervening in any Latin American country whose government was deemed",
  "unacceptable to them.",
  "Consequently, following the end of the Second World War the USA was able to exer",
  "\u00ac",
  "cise a hugeamountof economic, politicaland military influence,and Latin Americafound",
  "itself dragged into the Cold War. Republican presidents in particular were constantly",
  "suspicious that the USSR was trying to forge a Soviet-Latin American Axis, which would",
  "give the communists a clear advantage and pose a threat right on the USA\u2019s doorstep. US",
  "interventions to remove \u2018suspect\u2019 governments took place in Guatemala (1954), Cuba",
  "(1962), Brazil (1964), the Dominican Republic (1965), Chile (1970-3), Nicaragua (from",
  "1979 onwards), Panama (1989) and Haiti (1994). However, the attempt to remove Fidel",
  "Castrofrom Cuba in 1962failed miserably,and in 2012his brotherRaul wasstill in power",
  ".",
  "(see Sections 7.4(b) and 8.2)",
  "The international situation changed towards the end of the twentieth century with the",
  ".",
  "ending of the Cold War The demise of the communist \u2018enemy\u2019 - the Soviet Empire -",
  "removed the Americans\u2019 justification for their constant interventions. After half acentury",
  "of US domination, Latin American states had more freedom to take control of their own",
  "affairs; no longer could the USA accuse them of aiming to become part of a communist",
  "power bloc. Venezuela was the first country to throw off US influence when, in 1998,",

  "services to help alleviate poverty,and of making trading agreements with Cuba-absolute",

  "American voters: Brazil (2002), Argentina (2003), Chile (2005), Bolivia (2005) and",
  "Ecuador (2006) all elected presidents who, if not exactly left-wing, were determined to",

  "Chile relied on copper, Cuba on sugar and tobacco, and Bolivia on tin; during the",
  "1950s, in fact, 80 per cent of all Bolivia s revenue came from tin exports.",
  "Agriculture remained backward because peasant labour was so plentiful and cheap",
  "that wealthy estate owners had no need to go to the trouble of modernizing. Peru,",
  "for example was dominated by huge estates whose owners were all-powerful, and",
  ",",
  "who ruled their peasants like feudal monarchs.",
  "2 There wasa massive rise in population mainly becauseof advances in medicineand",
  "hygiene and the refusal of the Roman Catholic Church to promote birth control.",
  "Peasants found their holdings were too small to support large families, but when",
  "they moved to thecities they found that jobs were scarce. Almost all the majorcities",
  "weresurrounded by improvised shanty towns(known as farelas in Brazil) that were",
  "without water, sewage disposal or electricity. The gap between rich and poor grew",
  "wider and little progress was made in eliminating poverty and illiteracy.",
  "3 Latin American political systems were,for the most part, inadequatefordealing with",

  "Amencan Common",
  "reducing tariffs. Market (1960) had some success in",
  "610 PARTv DECOLONIZATION",
  "AND AFTER2 The United Nations helped by providing technical experts and holding conferences",
  ".",
  "to discuss how underdeveloped nations might go about increasing exports",
  "3 The USA provided massive economic aid. President Kennedy started the \u2018Alliance",
  "for Progress\u2019 which aimed to pump billionsof dollars into Latin America to enable",
  ".",
  "economic and social reform to be carried out However, this kind of aid did not",
  ".",
  "always work out for the best, and sometimes it created extra problems American",
  "motives were mixed: they hoped, by solving basic economic and social problems,",
  "to encourage the election of moderate reforming governments which would be",
  "popular enough to prevent communists from coming to power. Sometimes the aid",
  "was in the form of loans made on condition that a large proportion of the loan",
  "should be spent on buying US products. This did nothing to help the development",
  "of local industry and involved governments in large interest payments. Often, as",
  "with Castro\u2019s Cuba and Allende\u2019s Chile, aid would be cut short if a government",
  "unacceptable to the USA came to power. Only if the government changed would",
  "the aid be resumed. In this way the USA was able to exert political influence via",
  "economic control; on occasion, they supplied rebels with weapons to overthrow a",
  "reforming government (Guatemala, 1954), and even used 20,000 American troops",
  "tocrush an attemptedcomeback by a reforming president (the Dominican Republic,",
  "1965).",
  "(c) The crisis of the 1980s",
  "By the early 1980s it was clear that the problems of Latin America had not been solved.",
  "Two problems in particular- those of debt and finance- had reached crisis proportions.",
  "The trouble was that, under US domination, the countries of Latin America had been",
  "obliged to follow economic policies known as \u2018neo-liberalism\u2019. This involved privatiza",
  "\u00ac.",
  "tion, deregulation of finance, cuts in social spending and other austerity measures",
  "Basically this was designed to make use of a country\u2019s resources in order to benefit a",
  "wealthy elite at home,foreign investors, big businessand bankers, particularly those in the",
  "USA. This had forced Latin American governments to borrow massively from foreign",
  "banks, in order to develop their amenitiesand industries. Many of these banks were in the",
  "USA,and the borrowing was at its height from 1973 until 1982. In 1982 the seven largest",
  "US banks made60 percentof their profitsfrom the intereston loans to Third World coun",
  "\u00ac",
  "tries, as against only 2 per cent in 1970. With the doubling of American interest rates in",
  "the period 1979-81, many of the debtor nations could not even pay the interest, let alone",
  "repay the debts, and the amount of interest they failed to pay each year was added on to",
  "the existing debt. They were forced to borrow from new sources merely to keep up the",
  "interest payments on the original loans. If a country stepped out of line, the USA did not",
  "hesitate to intervene; for example in 1991 the democratically elected president of Haiti,",
  "Jean-Bertrand Aristide, wasremoved in a military coup backed by theCIAafter only eight",
  ".",
  "months in office Aristide was a committed Roman Catholic, a former priest, who was",
  ".",
  "strongly influenced by the ideals of the Church\u2019s liberation theology This was a style of",
  "theology whichaccepted many of Marx\u2019s theories(though not hisatheism!).It stressed the",
  "church\u2019s mission to the poorand oppressed, based on the fact that Jesus wasconsidered as",
  "a sympathizer with, and a liberator of the poor and downtrodden. In 2004 Aristide was",
  "removed for thesecond time in asimilarcoup.Throughout Latin America there were large",
  "numbers of priests with left-wing views and some were even supporters of revolution.",
  "Inevitably this brought them into conflict with the authorities; many were arrested and",
  "-",
  "some were killed. In 1980 Bishop Oscar Romera of El Salvador was murdered by US",
  ".",
  "backed paramilitaries",
  "By 1985 Latin America owed some $368 billion, and there was a constant drain of",
  "611",
  "LATIN AMERICA.",
  "capital to the USA, leaving Latin America increasingly impoverished By 1987, as export",
  ".",
  "earnings steadily declined, the situation was approaching catastrophe Brazil, one of the",
  "most prosperousstates with its huge natural resources, had debtsof over$100 million,and",
  "in February the government announced that it was suspending interest payments. Mexico,",
  "which owed almost as much, was considering the possibility of repudiating its debts.",
  "Fortunately it didn\u2019t quite come to that: the IMF and the World Bank, desperate to avoid",
  "an economic catastrophe, arranged credits amounting to several billion dollars for Brazil.",
  "The Mexican government secured an annual loan for the next 30 years from the IMF and",
  "was able to reschedule its debts. Similar arrangements helped other debtor countries to",
  ".",
  "survive",
  "There is insufficient space to consider all the countries of Latin America, but a closer",
  "look atfive of them-Brazil, Venezuela, Mexico,Guatemala and Nicaragua-will demon",
  "\u00ac",
  "strate the varied Latin American experience during this period of US domination.",
  "26.2 SOUTH AMERICA: BRAZIL AND VENEZUELA",
  "(a) Brazil",
  "Brazil had gained its independence from Portugal in 1825. It was a monarchy until 1889,",
  ".",
  "when it became a republic Until 1930 the country was ruled mainly by military dictator",
  "\u00ac",
  "ships, but none of them succeeded in establishing a stable system. There were economic,",
  ".",
  "social and political problems which caused several revolutions and attempted coups The",
  "country began to make genuine economic progress after 1930 when the army replaced the",
  "-",
  "ultra conservative government of wealthy landowners with the more progressive and",
  "liberal President Getulio Vargas. For the first time the government took over economic",
  "planning, and Vargas was especially keen to encourage industry. Thousands of extra jobs",
  ".",
  "were created, especially in electrical and steel manufacture He soon became popular and",
  "was able to stay in power right through the Second World War. However, by this time the",
  "army was turning against him. They were worried by his popularity with the working",
  "classes and felt that he had become too powerful. In fact, he had been acting as a dictator",
  "since 1937, and no elections had taken place. The army wanted a president whom they",
  "could control,and so in 1945 Vargas wasforced to step down. The army faced a dilemma",
  "when he was re-elected in 1950 for a five-year term: should they prevent him from taking",
  "office or not? Fortunately the younger army officers favoured Vargas and in the end, he",
  "was allowed to return. He stayed in power until 1954. He tried to continue acting as a",
  "dictator and once again the army grew tired of him. They accused him of corruption and",
  ".",
  "incompetence and asked him to resign Instead, he committed suicide, claiming that his",
  "death was \u2018a sacrifice on behalf of the Brazilian workers\u2019.",
  "The election of 1955 was won by Juscelino Kubitschek, whose first major action was",
  "to increase the army\u2019s pay, thereby, he hoped, guaranteeing their support. He completed",

  "his term in office in 1961, but his presidency was a disappointment His only memorable",

  "more people the right to vote He also planned to limit the amount of profit that large",
  "multinational companies could take out of the country; the government could then use the",
  "extra revenue to help improve social conditions for the masses. Worse still-as far as the",
  "USA wasconcerned-he opened diplomatic relations with the USSR, promised to nation",
  "\u00ac",
  "alize Brazil\u2019s oil refineries, and opposed economic sanctions against Cuba.",
  "All this was much too radical for the army and for the right, and tension between them",
  "612",
  "PARTY DECOLONIZATION ANDAFTER.",
  "and Goulart\u2019s supporters looked like developing into civil war US president Lyndon",
  "Johnson told the American ambassador in Brazil that the USA mustdo everything possible",
  "to help overthrow \u2018this left-wing government\u2019.Goulart was accused of being a communist,",
  "though by no stretch of the imagination could this be taken seriously; in fact he was a",
  "millionaire landowner and a devout Roman Catholic. However, in April 1964 he was",
  ".",
  "removed in a military coup Fortunately there was no civil war, but it emerged later that",
  "President Johnson had ordered US naval vessels, including an aircraft carrier and two",

  ".",
  "economic difficulties He had failed to attract sufficientforeign investment which had been",
  "discouraged by the USA; inflation increased rapidly,and economic growth was minimal.",
  "For the next 20 years Brazil was ruled by the military. For the first few years their",
  "policy wasone of harsh repression: the old political parties were banned, there was a strict",
  "presscensorship,opponents were arrested and the jails soon filled with political prisoners;",
  "trade unionists and left-wing students were a favourite target and there were reports of",
  "widespread torture and violent treatment of prisoners. After 1974, when General Ernesto",
  "Geisel became president, repression was gradually relaxed and it was announced that the",
  "army would return the country to full democracy, albeit slowly. During the years of mili",
  "\u00ac",
  "tary dictatorship the government had great success with its economic policies, achieving",
  "what many described as an \u2018economic miracle\u2019. Faced with massive inflation and a stag",
  "\u00ac.",
  "nating economy, they tackled the problems by borrowing extensively from abroad",
  "Countries that had been unwilling to lend to the Goulart government were quite happy to",
  ".",
  "do business with a strong right-wing regime which had eliminated communist influence",
  "This stimulated economic growth so that the years 1968-74 were a boom period; the",
  "annual growth rate was 10 percentand exportsquadrupled. After 1974 thegrowth ratefell",
  "to around 5 per cent, mainly because Brazil was having to import more of its oil supplies,",
  "much of itfrom Iraq. By 1980 itseemed that thegood times wereover: Brazil had incurred",
  "hugeforeign debts,there wasaslump in export markets,there wasa yawning gap between",
  "rich and poor and there was widespread unrest among the rural poor in the north east of",
  "the country. In an attempt to find substitute fuels, the government, which had its own",
  "supplies of uranium, turned to nuclear power and bought reactors from West Germany.",
  "But there was no immediate improvement and in provincial elections in 1982, the govern",
  "\u00ac",
  ".",
  "ment suffered significant defeats",
  "Faced with escalating economic and social problems, the military decided this was an",
  "appropriate time to hand powerover tocivilians. In 1985 the presidential electoral college",
  "chose the 75-year-old Tancredo Neves as the first civilian president for over 20 years.",
  "Sadly, he was taken ill almost immediately and died before he could be sworn in. His",
  "deputy, Jose Sarney, took over and for the next four years struggled to stabilize the econ",
  "\u00ac",
  "omy. In February 1987 the government announced that it was suspending interest",
  "payments, but the IMF came to the rescue with credits amounting to $41 million. Brazil",
  "was able to pay the interest on time, but Sarney\u2019s emergency policies caused hyper-infla",
  "\u00ac",
  "tion,and in the 1989 election he wasdefeated by Ferdinando Collor. In an attempt to stem",

  "\u00ac",
  "ued,government expenditure was reduced, bank accounts of over 50 000 cruzeiros (about",
  "\u00a31300 US at that time) were frozen for 18 months. This was a disastrous move since it",
  "meant that the economy was deprived of some $80 billion at a time when it was most",
  "needed. The result was a wave of business failures and massive unemployment. In the",
  "midst of the chaos Collor was accused of corruption, impeached by the Senate and forced",
  "to resign at the end of 1992.",
  "-",
  "The 1994 election was won by a coalition of right wing groups with Francesco",
  "Cardoso as president. He had produced a Plano Real designed to bring inflation under",

  "control. This involved large tax increases, wage reductions for public service workers,",
  "LATIN AMERICA 613.",
  "and the privatization of many government enterprises This had great success in lowering",
  "inflation from a thousand percent when the plan was first put intoaction, to single figures",
  "by 1997. Overseas markets began to revive and there were marked increases in exports of",
  "agricultural produce and manufactured goods. Cardoso was re-elected president in 1998.",
  "Just as it seemed that Brazil had at last achieved some sort of stability, there was another",
  ". -",
  "crisis Some of its foreign customers, including Russia and south east Asia, reduced their",
  "imports from Brazil, government spending and borrowing were still much too high, and",

  "Venezuela is one of the wealthiest states of Latin America because of its oil resources",
  "Until 1945, however, profits went to foreign oilcompanies (mainly American and British)",
  ".",
  "or to the small group of wealthy people who ran the country via a military dictatorship",
  "The great mass of the population received no benefit from this wealth and remained poor",
  ". -",
  "and illiterate In 1945 Romulo Betancourt, the leader of a progressive left wing party",
  "called Action Democratica, was placed in power by a group of young army officers after",
  ".",
  "fiercefighting in Caracas, the capital, had led to the overthrow of the military government",
  ".",
  "Betancourt introduced a new constitution which allowed full civil rights to all citizens A",
  "programme of land reform was introduced, heavy taxes were placed on the foreign oil",
  "companies, and plans were prepared to exclude the army from politics. These reforms",
  "were bitterly opposed by foreign companies and by rich landowners, and in 1948",
  "Betancourt was driven out of office by an army coup.",
  "For the next ten years the country was under ruthless military dictatorship. Political",
  "parties and trade unions were banned, and a strict press censorship was imposed. On the",
  "other hand, with the removal of Betancourt the USA was once again prepared to invest in",
  "Venezuela. American dollars flowed in and some progress was made with the building of",
  "steel plants toexploit localiron-oredeposits.Ironandsteelsoon became Venezuela\u2019smost",
  "valuable export, but still very little of the country\u2019s wealth filtered down to the ordinary",
  "people. In 1957 Archbishop Blanco of Caracas publicly condemned the great wealth and",
  "corruption that was rife among the country\u2019s leaders, while the majority of Venezuelans",
  "lived in poverty and often subhuman conditions. In 1958 a general strike broke out and a",
  "section of the army removed the dictatorMarcosPerezJimenez(1952-8).Democracy was",
  ".",
  "restored and Betancourt was voted back into power",
  "Betancourt immediately raised Venezuela\u2019sshareof oil revenues to60 percent, but this",
  "disappointed the growing communist party which had expected him to nationalize all",
  "foreign companies.However, he proceeded cautiously, not wanting to alienate the USA in",
  "case aid was stopped. Although measures were introduced to improve education and",
  "health, his popularity gradually waned, though he was able to complete his presidency,",
  "stepping down in 1964. Democracy survived, with the presidency alternating between",
  "Action Democratica and the other main group, the Christian Social Party. Venezuela was",
  "now the main supplier of oil for the Central American states and to a lesser extent for the",
  "USA, and was doing well out of the great oil boom of the early 1970s. In 1976 President",
  "614",

  ".",
  "then there was a fall in world oil prices that adversely affected Venezuela\u2019s revenue At",
  "the same time there were difficulties in maintaining the levels of its other main exports-",

  "century of more liberal governments The army seized power in 1972, but giving way to",
  "popular demand, they returned the country to democracy in 1979. However, progress",
  "towards modernization was disappointing; successive governments failed to deliver on",
  "their promises of land reform, an end to unemployment and the provision of social",
  "services. In 1998 a fall in the world price of oil, Ecuador\u2019s main export, caused an",
  "economic crisis; inflation rose to over 40 per cent,and the poverty rate rocketed to around",
  "70 per cent. Although the economy recovered quickly, the government became increas",
  "\u00ac",
  "ingly unpopular, because of its strict austerity measures together with blatant corruption",
  "among leading politicians. In 2006 there were huge protest demonstrations against a",

  "It soon became clear that the new president intended to follow the example of Chavez",

  "the new constitution was approved by 64 per cent of voters This now required a general",

  "2013, which could be extended to 2017 if he were to be elected again. In 2010 legislation",

  "These policies alienated various right wing groups and in September 2010, after",
  "President Correa took the dangerous step of ending bonuses and other benefits for the",
  "police force, protest demonstrations broke out in which the police were heavily involved.",
  "Road blocks were set up and protesters invaded the National Assembly and the state-run",
  "TV station. When Correa tried to talk with police representatives, he was kidnapped and",
  "held hostage. It looked as though a coup was being attempted, and the president declared",

  "roads, hospitals and schools. In 2011 Ecuador\u2019s economy grew by 7.8 per cent, helped by",
  "higher oil prices. Not surprisingly the president\u2019s popularity with the poor increased",
  "considerably, but the middle classes complained about rising prices and rising taxation,",
  "while human-rights groups accused him of making himself too powerful. Although the",
  "opposition was divided and relatively small in number, Correa had to contend with a",

  "Taking office in January 2007, President Ortega had become less \u2018revolutionary\u2019 and",

  "This chapter has shown how, during the early years of the twenty first century, Latin",
  "America became one of the most fascinating regions of the world. Starting in Venezuela",
  "with the election of Hugo Chavez in 1998, a new trend began to spread across the region.",
  "This was the change from neo-liberalism to policies which allowed a country\u2019s resources",
  "to be shared more equally among the great mass of the population, and which enabled",
  "modernization to take place. Of course there were different degrees of change: the USA",
  "did its best to divide Mexico,Chile and Guatemala from the rest by making separate trade",

  "Another regional organization is the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR),",
  "which was set up at a meeting in the Brazilian capital in 2008. It brought together two",

  "And finally, some of the Latin American countries began a diversification of markets",

  "oil exporter in the hemisphere, delivered quite a blow to Washington\u2019s energy policies.",
  "Having built up probably the closest relations with China of any Latin American country,",
  "Venezuela plans to export increasing amounts of oil to China as part of its effort to reduce",
  "its dependence on the openly hostile US government. In fact Latin America as a whole is",
  "increasing trade and other relations with China, in particular raw materials exporters such",
  "as Brazil, Peru and Chile. For Brazil, now often called \u2018the farmer of the world\u2019, China is",
  "now its largest trading partner. These increases are just part of the move toward a more",

  "indefinitely. As Noam Chomsky explains:",
  "The former colonies in Latin America have a better chance now than ever before to",
