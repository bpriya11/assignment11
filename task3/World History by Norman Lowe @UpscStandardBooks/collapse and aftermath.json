  "With the departure of Stalin, the situation was similar to that after Lenin\u2019s death in 1924:",
  "there was no obvious candidate to take charge. Stalin had allowed no one to show any",

  "Politburo,or Praesidium,as it was now called,decided to share powerand rule asa group.",

  "in 1955 after disagreeing with Khrushchev about industrial policies, but it was significant",
  ".",
  "that in the new relaxed atmosphere, he was not executed or imprisoned",
  "Khrushchev\u2019s position was further strengthened by an amazing speech which he deliv",
  "\u00ac",
  "ered at the Twentieth Communist Party Congress (February 1956) strongly criticizing",
  ".",
  "various aspects of Stalin\u2019s policies He:",
  "(cid:127) condemned Stalin for encouraging the cult of his own personality instead of allow",
  "\u00ac",
  "ing the Party to rule;",
  "(cid:127)",
  "revealeddetailsaboutStalin\u2019s purgesand the wrongful executionsof the 1930s,and",
  "criticized his conduct of the war;",
  "(cid:127) claimed that socialism could be achieved in ways other than those insisted on by",
  "Stalin;",
  "(cid:127)",
  "suggested that peaceful coexistence with the west was not only possible but essen",
  "\u00ac",
  "tial if nuclear war was to be avoided.",
  "Why did Khrushchev make this attack on Stalin? It was a risky step to take, bearing in",
  "mind that he and most of his colleagues owed their positions to Stalin and had gone along",
  ".",
  "with his worst excesses without protest Khrushchev genuinely believed that the truth",
  "about Stalin\u2019s crimes would have to come out sooner or later, and that it would be better",
  "if the Party took the initiative itself and confronted the issue before it was forced into it by",
  "public pressure. This argument enabled him to secure the approval of his colleagues for",
  "him to deliver the speech, and then he used the opportunity cleverly for his own political",
  "ends. He emphasized that he had only joined the Politburo in 1939, giving the clear",
  "impression that his seniors-Malenkov, Molotov, Kaganovitch and Voroshilov-were all",
  ".",
  "infinitely more responsible for the bloodletting than he was His publicly condemning",
  "Stalin\u2019s behaviour in this way made it more difficult for any future leader to attempt to",
  "imitate him. Khrushchev genuinely felt, too, that Stalin\u2019ssystem had held up progressand",
  "stifled initiative;he wanted to get things back on the track that Lenin would havefollowed,",
  ".",
  "and rule as an enlightened dictator",
  "Khrushchev was not quite supreme yet; Molotov and Malenkov believed his speech",
  "was too drastic and would encourage unrest (they blamed him for the Hungarian revolu",
  "\u00ac",
  "tion of October 1956), and they tried to force him out of office. However, as party secre",
  "\u00ac",
  "tary, Khrushchev, like Stalin before him, had been quietly filling key positions with his",
  "own supporters, and since he could rely on the army, it was Molotov and Malenkov who",
  "found themselves compulsorily retired (June 1957). After that, Khrushchev was fully",
  "responsible for all Russian policy until 1964. But he never wielded as much power as",

  "lands scheme Critics in the Party complained that too much was being spent on agricul",
  "\u00ac",
  "ture to the detriment of industry; Khrushchev had to give way, and the supply of agricul",
  "\u00ac",
  "tural equipment dwindled. But the main problem was that much of the land was of poor",
  "quality, not enough fertilizers were used, because they were expensive,and the exhausted",
  "soil began to blow away in dust storms. In general there was still too much interference in",
  "agriculture from local party officials,and it remained the least efficient sector of the econ",
  "\u00ac",
  "omy. The Russians had to rely on grain imports, often from the USA and Australia; this",
  "humiliation contributed to Khrushchev\u2019s downfall in October 1964.",
  "3 Political, social and cultural changes",
  "There were important changes in all these areas. Khrushchev favoured a more relaxed",
  "approach in general and the period became known as the \u2018thaw\u2019. In politics this included",
  "a return to party control instead of Stalin\u2019s personality cult. Khrushchev was careful not to",

  "act too much like a dictator for fear of laying himself open to similar charges There was",

  "this was too latefor some people: Nadezhda Mandelstam received a letteraddressed to her",
  "husband Osip, informing him that he had been rehabilitated;sadly, he had died in a labour",
  "camp in 1938.",
  ".",
  "There was more freedom for ordinary people, and a higher standard of living It was",
  "estimated that in 1958 at least 100 million people were living below the poverty line, but",
  "in 1967 this had fallen to about 30 million; the improvement was due mainly to the intro",
  "\u00ac",
  ".",
  "duction of a minimum wage",
  ".",
  "There was more freedom for writers, for whom Khrushchev had great respect Ilya",
  "Ehrenburg caused a stir with the publication of The Thaw,a novel full of criticisms of the",
  ". .",
  "Stalin era (1954) Anna Akhmatova, Bulgakov and Meyerhold were rehabilitated",
  "Alexander Solzhenitsyn\u2019s novelOne Dayinthe Life of Ivan Denisovich,aboutan innocent",
  "man sentenced to hard labour, drew on his own experiences of eight years in a camp. The",
  "simple test of Khrushchev\u2019s reaction to a new work was: if it attacked Stalin and his",
  "system, it would be approved; if it attacked the Party or present aspects of Soviet life, it",
  ".",
  "would be denounced and banned Some writers overstepped the mark and found them",
  "\u00ac",
  "selves disgraced and expelled from the writers\u2019 union. But at least they did not end up in",
  ".",
  "labour camps",
  "The \u2018thaw\u2019 also had its limits in other areas;for example, Khrushchev decided that the",
  "Orthodox Church was gaining too much influence in Soviet life. Thousands of churches",
  "were closed down and it was illegal to hold gatherings in private houses without permis",
  "\u00ac",
  "sion; since this was never granted for religious meetings,it became extremely difficult for",
  "Christians to worship. In 1962 when some factory workers at Novocherkassk went on",
  "strike and organized a demonstration in protest against increases in meat and dairy prices,",
  ".",
  "tanks and troops were called in Troops fired into the crowd, killing 23 people and injur",
  ". \u00ac",
  "ing dozens more; 49 people were arrested and five of the ringleaders were executed",
  "4 Foreign affairs",
  "Following his Twentieth Party Congress speech, Khrushchev aimed for peaceful coexis",
  "\u00ac",
  "tence and a thaw in the ColdWar (see Section 7.3), and seemed prepared to allow differ",
  "\u00ac",
  "ent \u2018roads to socialism\u2019 among the satellite states of eastern Europe. However, these",
  "departures from strict Marxist-Leninist ideas (including his encouragement of profit and",
  ".",
  "wage incentives) laid him open toChinese accusationsof revisionism (seeSection 8.6(d))",
  "In addition, encouraged by his speech, Poland and Hungary tried to break free from",

  "the grounds of ill health; in fact, although he was 70, his health was perfectly good T(he",
  "real reasons were probably the failure of his agricultural policy (though he had been no",
  "less successful than previous governments in this), his loss of prestige over the Cuban",
  "missiles crisis (see Section 7.4(b)), and the widening breach with China, which he made",
  "no attempt to heal. He had offended many important groups in society: his attempts",
  "to",
  "make the Party and the government more efficient and decentralized brought him into",
  "conflict with the bureaucracy, whose privileged positions were being threatened.Themili-",
  "tary disapprovedof hiscutsin defencespendingand hisattempts tolimit nuclear weapons.",
  "Perhaps his colleagues were tired of his extrovert personality (once, in a heated moment",
  "at the United Nations, he took off hisshoe and hammered the table with it)and felt hewas",
  "taking too much on himself. Without consulting them he had just tried to win the friend",
  "\u00ac",
  "ship of President Nasser of Egypt by awarding him the Order of Lenin at a time when he",
  "was busy arresting Egyptian communists. Khrushchev had become increasingly aggres",
  "\u00ac",
  "sive and arrogant, and at times seemed to have developed the \u2018cult of personality\u2019 almosi",
  "as much as Stalin.",
  "In spite of his failures, many historians believe that Khrushchev deservesconsiderable",
  "credit; his period in power has been described as \u2018the Khrushchev revolution\u2019. He wasa",
  "man of outstanding personality:a tough politician and yet at the same time impulsiveand",
  "full of warmth and humour. After Stalin\u2019s grim remoteness, his more approachable and",
  "human style was more than welcome; he deserves to be remembered for the return to",
  "comparatively civilized politics (at least inside Russia). Alec Nove believed that the",
  "improvement in living standardsand hissocial policies were perhaps hisgreatest achieve",
  "\u00ac",
  "ments. Others see his \u2018peaceful coexistence\u2019 policy and his willingness to reduce nuclear",
  "weaponsas a remarkable change in attitude.",
  "Martin McCauley sees Khrushchev as a kind of heroic failure, a man with a noble",
  "vision,whosesuccess wasonly modest because he was letdown by thegreedandconcern",
  "for theirown positionsof those in authority. Powerful vested interests in the Party and the",
  "state administration did everything they could to delay his attempts to decentralize and",
  "\u2018return power to the people\u2019. Dmitri Volkogonov, who was not a great admirer of any of",

  "mental way also changed society. However much his successor, Brezhnev, may have",

  "remained leader until his death in November 1982. Reform disappeared from the agenda;",
  "most of Khrushchev\u2019s policies were abandoned and serious economic problems were",
  "ignored. Brezhnev and his colleagues were less tolerant of criticism than Khrushchev;",
  "anything that threatened the stability of the system orencouraged independent thinking was",

  "seems to have been to keep the nomemklatura (the ruling elite and the bureaucracy) happy.",
  "1 Economic policies",
  "Economic policies maintained wage differentials and profit incentives, and some growth",
  "took place, but the rate was slow.Thesystem remained strongly centralized,and Brezhnev",
  "was reluctant to take any major initiatives. By 1982 therefore, much of Russian industry",
  "was old-fashioned and in need of new production and processing technology. There was",
  "concern about the failure of the coal and oil industries to increase output,and the building",
  "industry was notorious for slowness and poor quality. Low agricultural yield was still a",
  "major problem-not once in the period 1980-4did grain production come anywhere near",
  "the targets set. The 1981 harvest was disastrous and 1982 was only slightly better, throw",
  "\u00ac",
  "ing Russia into an uncomfortable dependence on American wheat. It was calculated that",
  "in the USA in 1980 one agricultural worker produced enough to feed 75 people, while his",
  ".",
  "counterpart in Russia could manage only enough to feed 10",
  "The one section of the economy which was successful was the production of military",
  "hardware. By the early 1970s the USSR had caught up with the USA in numbers of inter",
  "\u00ac",
  "continental missiles, and had developed a new weapon, the anti-ballistic missile (ABM).",
  "Unfortunately,the armsracedid not stop there-the Americanscontinued to produceeven",

  "communist country was justified if socialism in that country was considered to be threat",
  ". \u00ac",
  "ened This caused some friction with Romania, which had always tried to maintain some",
  "independence, refusing to send troops into Czechoslovakia and keeping on good terms",
  "with China. The Russian invasion of Afghanistan (1979) was the most blatant application",

  "However, personal freedom became more limited. For instance, by 1970 it was impos",

  "Gorbachev was much more cautious, realizing that Yeltsin\u2019s plans would cause",
  "massive unemployment and even higher prices. He was fully aware of how",

  "would then stabilize and people\u2019s lives would gradually improve.",
  "This \u2018shock therapy\u2019,asit was called, began in January 1992 with the removal of price",
  "controlsfrom about90 percentof goods,and theendingof governmentsubsidies to indus",
  "\u00ac",
  "try. Prices rose steeply and kept on rising after the first six months. By the end of the year",
  "prices were,on average, 30 times higher than at the beginning; there were plenty of goods",
  "in the shops but most people could not afford to buy them. The situation was disastrous,",
  "since wagesdid not keep pace with prices;as sales fell,factory workers were laid off,and",
  "over a million people lost their jobs. Thousands were homeless and were forced to live in",
  "tents outside the towns. Many people had to rely on food parcels sent from abroad.",
  "When the privatization programme began, it seemed as though the intention wasforall",
  "big state industries and collective farms to be transferred to the joint ownership of all the",
  "people. Every citizen was given vouchers to the value of 10000 roublesas theirshare,and",
  "there were plansfor workers to be able to buy shares in theirenterprise. However, none of",
  "this happened; 10000 roubles was the equivalentof about\u00a335-a minuteamountata time",

  "as the \u2018oligarchs\u2019 They made enormous profits, but from government subsidies, which",
  "were reintroduced, rather than from the market. Instead of reinvesting their profits in",
  "industry,as the government intended, they transferred them into Swiss bank accounts and",
  "foreign investments. Total investment in Russia fell by two-thirds.",
  "Long before this stage was reached, Yeltsin\u2019s popularity had dwindled. Two of his",
  "former supporters, Alexander Rutskoi and Ruslan Khasbulatov, led the opposition in the",
  "Supreme Soviet and forced Yeltsin to dismiss Gaidar, replacing him with Viktor",
  "Chernomyrdin. In January 1993 he reintroduced some controls on prices and profits, but",

  "of powers between president and parliament. However,in November 1992 theCommunist",
  "Party was legalized again, and other groups began to form, although Yeltsin himself did",
  "not have a supporting party. A majority in parliament strongly opposed Yeltsin\u2019s policies",

  "greatest boost came when the ceasefire was signed in Chechnya shortly before the election.",
  "Zyuganov also presented an attractive programme, but he lacked Yeltsin\u2019s personal",

  "won a narrow victory with 35 per cent of the votes to Zyuganov\u2019s 32 per cent; Gorbachev",
  "received barely 1 per cent of the votes. In spite of his ill health, Yeltsin\u2019s team continued",
  "to campaign vigorously; in the second round he won a decisive victory over Zyuganov,",
  "taking 54 per cent of the votes. It was a remarkable victory, considering his low popular",
  "\u00ac",
  "ity at the beginning of the campaign and the fact that the economic situation was only just",
  "beginning to improve. The reason for Yeltsin\u2019s victory was not so much that people liked",
  "him, but that they liked the alternative even less. If the communists had put forward",
  "genuine social democrat policies,Zyuganov might well have won. But Zyuganov was not",
