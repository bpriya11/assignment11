  "This short period is of crucial importance in world history because it culminated in the",
  ".",
  "Second World War Economic problems caused the Locarno spirit to fade away, and the",
  "new rule seemed to be: every country for itself. Affairs were dominated by the three",
  "aggressive powers - Japan, Italy and Germany; their extreme nationalism led them to",
  "commit so many actsof violence and breachesof international agreements that in the end,",
  "the world was plunged into total war.",
  "Japan became the first major aggressor with its successful invasion of the eastern part",
  ".",
  "of China, known as Manchuria, in 1931 Both Hitler and Mussolini took note of the fail",
  "\u00ac",
  "ure of the League of Nations to curb Japanese aggression. Hitler, by far the most subtle of",
  "the three, began cautiously by announcing the reintroduction of conscription (March",
  ".",
  "1935) This breach of Versailles caused Britain, France and Italy to draw together briefly",
  "insuspicionof Germany.Ata meeting held inStresa (on Lake Maggiorein northern Italy),",
  "they condemned Hitler\u2019s action, and soon afterwards (May) the French, obviously",
  "worried, signed a treaty of mutual assistance with the USSR.",

  "1935 when the British, without consulting France and Italy, signed the Anglo German",
  "Naval Agreement', this allowed the Germans to build submarines - another breach of",
  "Versailles.Thisastonishing move by Britain disgusted France and Italy and destroyed any",
  "trust which had existed between the three of them. Mussolini,encouraged by Japanese and",
  "German successes, now followed suit with his successful invasion of Abyssinia (October",
  "1935), which met only half-hearted resistance from the League and from Britain and",

  "France",
  "March 1936 saw Hitler sending troops into the Rhineland, which had been demilita",
  "\u00ac",
  "rized by the Versailles Treaty; Britain and France again protested but took no action to",
  "expel the Germans. An understanding then followed (October 1936) between Germany",
  "and Italy, Mussolini having decided to throw in his lot with Hitler; it was known as the",
  ".",
  "Rome-Berlin Axis The following month Hitler signed the Anti-Comintern Pact with",
  "Japan. (The Comintern, or Communist International, was an organization set up in 1919",

  "not object, carried out his most ambitious project to date - the annexation of Austria",
  "(known as the Anschluss - \u2018forcible union\u2019) in March 1938. Next he turned his atten",

  "result in their being excluded from Manchuria At the League of Nations,SirJohn Simon,",
  "the British Foreign Secretary, presented a strong defence of Japan\u2019s actions. Japan had",
  "been involved in the province since the 1890s,and was given Port Arthur and a privileged",
  "position in South Manchuria as a result of the Russo-Japanese War (1904-5).Since then,",
  "the Japanese had invested millions of pounds in Manchuria in the development of indus",

  "themselves were suffering economic hardship because of the Great Depression. The",
  "Japanese announced that they had turned Manchuria into the independent state of",

  "5.2 MUSSOLINI'S FOREIGN POLICY",
  "In the early days of Mussolini\u2019s regime (he came to power in 1922-see Section 13.1(e)),",
  "Italianforeign policy seemed ratherconfused:Mussoliniknew what he wanted, which was",
  "\u2018to make Italy great, respected and feared\u2019, but he was not sure how to achieve this, apart",
  "from agitating for a revision of the 1919 peace settlement in Italy\u2019s favour. At first he",
  "seemed to think an adventurous foreign policy was his best line of action, hence the Corfu",
  "Incident (seeSection 3.4(d))and theoccupation of Fiumein 1923.By an agreement signed",
  "at Rapallo in 1920, Fiume was to be a \u2018free city\u2019, used jointly by Italy and Yugoslavia;",
  ".",
  "after Italian troops moved in, Yugoslavia agreed that it should belong to Italy After these",
  "early successes, Mussolini became more cautious, perhaps alarmed by Italy\u2019s isolation at",
  "the time of Corfu. After 1923 his policy falls roughly into two phases with the break at",
  "1934, when he began to draw closer towards Nazi Germany.",
  "(a) 1923-34",
  "At this stage Mussolini\u2019s policy was determined by rivalry with the French in the",
  "Mediterranean and the Balkans, where Italian relations with Yugoslavia, France\u2019s ally,",
  ".",
  "were usually strained Another consideration was the Italian fear that the weak state of",
  "-",
  "Austria, along her north eastern frontier, might fall too much under the influence of",
  "Germany;Mussolini was worried abouta possible German threat via the Brenner Pass.He",
  "tried to deal with both problems mainly by diplomatic means:",
  "1 He attended the Locarno Conference (1925) but was disappointed when the agree",
  "\u00ac",
  ".",
  "ments signed did not guarantee the Italian frontier with Austria",
  "2 He was friendly towards Greece, Hungary, and especially Albania, the southern",
  "neighbour and rival of Yugoslavia.Economic and defence agreements were signed,",
  "72",
  "PARTI WAR ANDINTERNATIONAL RELATIONSwith the result that Albania was virtually controlled by Italy, which now had a",
  ".",
  "strong position around the Adriatic Sea",
  "3 He cultivated good relations with Britain: he supported her demand that Turkey",
  "should hand over Mosul province to Iraq, and in return, the British gave Italy a",
  ".",
  "small part of Somaliland",
  "4 Italy became the first state after Britain to recognize the USSR; a non-aggression",
  ".",
  "pact was signed between Italy and the USSR in September 1933",
  "5 He tried to bolster up Austria against the threat from Nazi Germany by supporting",
  "-",
  "the anti Nazi government of Chancellor Dollfuss, and by signing trade agreements",
  "with Austria and Hungary. When Dollfuss was murdered by the Austrian Nazis",
  "(July 1934), Mussolini sent three Italian divisions to the frontier in case the",
  "Germans invaded Austria; the Nazis immediately called off their attempt to seize",
  "power in Austria.Thisdecisive anti-German stand improved relations between Italy",
  "and France. However, though he was now highly respected abroad, Mussolini was",
  "getting impatient: his successes were not spectacular enough.",
  "(b) After 1934",
  "Mussolini gradually shifted from extreme suspicion of Hitler\u2019s designs on Austria to",
  ".",
  "grudging admiration of Hitler\u2019s achievements and a desire to imitate him After their first",
  "meeting (June 1934), Mussolini described Hitler contemptuously as \u2018that mad little",
  "clown\u2019, but he later came to believe that there was more to be gained from friendship with",
  "Germany than with Britain and France.The more he fell under Hitler\u2019s influence, the more",
  ".",
  "aggressive he became His changing attitude is illustrated by events:",
  "1 When Hitlerannounced the reintroduction of conscription (March 1935), Mussolini",
  "joined the British and French in condemning the German action and guaranteeing",
  ".",
  "Austria (the Stresa Front, April 1935) Both British and French carefully avoided",
  "mentioning the Abyssinian crisis, which was already brewing; Mussolini took this",
  "to mean that they would turn a blind eye to an Italian attack on Abyssinia, regard",
  "\u00ac",
  "ing it as a bit of old-fashioned colonial expansion. The Anglo-German Naval",
  "Agreement signed in June (see Section 5.3(b), Point 6) convinced Mussolini of",

  "British cynicism and self interest",
  "2 The Italian invasion of Abyssinia (Ethiopia) in October 1935 was the great turning",
  ".",
  "point in Mussolini\u2019s career Italian involvement in the country, the only remaining",
  "independent state left in Africa, went back to 1896, when an Italian attempt to colo",

  "5.3 WHAT WERE HITLER'S AIMS IN FOREIGN POLICY AND HOW",
  ",",
  "SUCCESSFUL HAD HE BEEN BY THE END OF 1938?",
  "(a) Hitler aimed to make Germany into a great power again",
  "He hoped to achieve this by:",
  "(cid:127)",
  "destroying the hated Versailles settlement;",
  "(cid:127) building up the army;",
  "(cid:127) recovering lost territory such as the Saar and the Polish Corridor;",
  "(cid:127)",
  "bringing all German-speaking peoples inside the Reich; this would involve annex",
  "\u00ac",
  "ing Austriaand taking territory fromCzechoslovakiaand Poland,both of which had",
  ".",
  "large German minorities as a result of the peace settlement",
  "There is some disagreement about what, if anything, Hitler intended beyond these aims.",
  "Some historians believe that annexing Austria and parts of Czechoslovakia and Poland",
  "was only a beginning, and that Hitler planned to follow it up by seizing the rest of",
  "Czechoslovakia and Poland, and then conquering and occupying Russia as far east as the",
  "Ural Mountains. \u2018National boundaries\u2019, he said, \u2018are only made by man and can be",
  "changed by man.\u2019 The changes of boundary which Hitler had in mind would give the",
  "Germans what he called Lebensraum (living space). He claimed that Germany\u2019s popula",
  "\u00ac",
  "tion was much too largefor the area into which it was constrained; more land was needed",
  "to provide food for the German people as well as an area in which the excess German",
  "75",
  "INTERNATIONALRELATIONS, 1933-39.",
  "population could settle and colonize Certainly Hitler had made clear his hatred of what he",
  ".",
  "called \u2018Jewish Bolshevism\u2019 This suggests that war with the USSR was unavoidable at",
  "some point, in order to destroy communism. The next stage would be to get colonies in",
  ".",
  "Africa and naval bases in and around the Atlantic",
  "Other historiansdisagree about these furtheraims;back in 1961 A. J. P.Taylor claimed",
  "that Hitler never had any detailed plans worked out for acquiring Lebensraum and never",
  "intended a major war; at most he was prepared only for a limited war against Poland. \u2018He",
  "got as far as he did because others did not know what to do with him\u2019,concluded Taylor.",
  "Martin Broszat, writing in 1983, also believed that Hitler\u2019s writings and statements about",
  "Lebensraum did not amount to an actual programme which he followed step by step. It is",
  "more likely they were a propagandaexercise designed to attract supportand unite the Nazi",
  "party. More recently Mark Mazower, in his book Hitler\u2019s Empire: Nazi Rule in Occupied",
  "Europe (2008), suggests that there is very little evidence that Hitler had given much seri",
  "\u00ac",
  "ous thought to the problems of creating and organising a Nazi empire in Europe.",
  "(b) A series of successes",
  "Whatever the truth about his long-term intentions, Hitler began his foreign policy with an",
  "almost unbroken series of brilliant successes, which was one of the main reasons for his",
  ".",
  "popularity in Germany By the end of 1938 almost every one of the first set of aims had",
  "been achieved, without war and with the approval of Britain.Only the Germans in Poland",
  ".",
  "remained to be brought within the Reich Unfortunately it was when he failed to achieve",
  "this by peaceful means that Hitler took the fateful decision to invade Poland.",
  "1 Given thatGermany wasstill militarily weak in 1933, Hitlerhadtomovecautiously",
  ".",
  "at first He withdrew Germany from the World Disarmament Conference and from",
  "the League of Nations, on the grounds that France would not agree to Germany",
  "having equality of armaments. At the same time he insisted that Germany was will",
  "\u00ac",
  "ing todisarm if other states would do the same,and that he wanted only peace.This",
  "was one of his favourite techniques: to act boldly while at the same time soothing",
  ".",
  "his opponents with the sort of conciliatory speeches he knew they wanted to hear",
  "2 Next Hitler signed a ten-year non-aggression pact with the Poles (January 1934),",
  "who wereshowingalarm in case theGermans tried to take back the Polish Corridor.",
  "This was something of a triumph for Hitler: Britain took it as further evidence of",
  "his peaceful intentions; it ruined France\u2019s Little Entente (seeSection 4.2(b)), which",
  "depended very much on Poland; and it guaranteed Polish neutrality whenever",
  "Germany decided to move against Austria and Czechoslovakia. On the other hand,",
  "it improved relations between France and Russia, who were both worried by the",
  ".",
  "apparent threat from Nazi Germany",
  "3 In July 1934 Hitler suffered a setback to his ambitions of an Anschluss (union)",
  ".",
  "between Germany and Austria The Austrian Nazis,encouraged by Hitler,staged a",
  "revolt and murdered the Chancellor, Engelbert Dollfuss, who had been supported",
  ".",
  "by Mussolini However, when Mussolini moved Italian troops to the Austrian fron",
  "\u00ac",

  "tier and warned the Germans off, the revolt collapsed Hitler, taken aback, had to",
  "accept that Germany was not yet strong enough to force the issue, and he denied",
  ".",
  "responsibility for the actions of the Austrian Nazis",
  "4 The Saar was returned to Germany (January 1935) after a plebiscite (referendum)",
  "resulting in a 90 per cent vote in favour. Though the vote had been provided for in",
  "the peace settlement, Nazi propaganda made the most of the success. Hitler",

  "removed",

  "INTERNATIONALRELATIONS, 1933-395.4 APPEASEMENT",
  "(a) What is meant by the term 'appeasement'?",
  "Appeasement was the policy followed by the British,and later by the French,of avoiding",
  "war with aggressive powers such as Japan, Italy and Germany, by giving way to their",
  "demands,provided they were not too unreasonable.",
  "There were two distinct phases of appeasement",
  "-",
  "1 From the mid 1920s until 1937,there wasa vague feeling that war must be avoided",
  "at all cost, and Britain and sometimes France drifted along, accepting the various",
  "acts of aggression and breaches of Versailles (Manchuria, Abyssinia,German rear",

  "mament, the Rhineland reoccupation)",
  "2 When Neville Chamberlain became British prime minister in May 1937, he gave",

  "what Hitler wanted and show him that reasonable claims could be met by negotia",
  "\u00ac",
  ".",
  "tion rather than by force",
  "The beginnings of appeasement can be seen in British policy during the 1920s with the",
  "Dawesand Young Plans, which tried toconciliate the Germans,and also with the Locarno",
  "Treaties and their vital omission - Britain did not agree to guarantee Germany\u2019s eastern",

  "When Austen Chamberlain, the British Foreign Minister (and Neville\u2019s half-brother),",
  "remarked at the time of Locarno that no British government would ever risk the bones of",
  "a single British grenadier in defence of the Polish Corridor, it seemed to the Germans that",
  "Britain had turned her back on eastern Europe. Appeasement reached itsclimaxat Munich,",
  "where Britain and France were so determined to avoid war with Germany that they made",
  "Hitler a present of the Sudetenland, and so set in motion the destruction of",
  "Czechoslovakia. Even with such big concessions as this, appeasement failed.",

  "PART I WAR ANDINTERNATIONAL RELATIONS(b) How could appeasement be justified?",
  "At the time appeasement was being followed, there seemed to be many very good things",
  "in itsfavour,and the appeasers (who included MacDonald, Baldwin,Simon and Hoare as",
  "well as Neville Chamberlain) were convinced that their policy was right:",

  "Next, President Hacha was invited to Berlin, where Hitler told him that in order to",

  "The Germans resented the loss of Danzig and the Polish Corridor, at Versailles, and now",
  "that Czechoslovakia was safely out of the way, Polish neutrality was no longer necessary.",
  "In April 1939 Hitler demanded the return of Danzig and a road and railway across the",
  "corridor, linking East Prussia with the rest of Germany. This demand was, in fact, not",
  "unreasonable,since Danzig was mainly German-speaking; but with itcomingso soon after",
  "the seizure of Czechoslovakia, the Poles were convinced that the German demands were",
  "only the preliminary to an invasion. Already fortified by a British promise of help \u2018in the",
  "event of any action which clearly threatened Polish independence\u2019, the Foreign Minister,",
  "Colonel Beck, rejected the German demands and refused to attend a conference; no doubt",
  "he was afraid of another Munich. British pressure on the Poles to surrender Danzig was to",
  "no avail. Hitler was probably surprised by Beck\u2019s stubbornness, and was still hoping to",
  "remain on good terms with the Poles, at least for the time being.",
  "2 The Germans invade Poland",
  "The only way the British promise of help to Poland could be made effective was through",

  "an alliance that Hitler got in first and signed a non-aggression pact with the USSR They",

  "83",
  "INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS, 1933-39(a) Were the appeasers to blame?",

  "with Hitler before Germany had become too strong: an Anglo-French attack on western",
  "Germany in 1936 at the time of the Rhineland occupation would have taught Hitler a",

  "increased his prestige at home As Alan Bullock wrote, \u2018success and the absence of resis",

  "\u00ac",
  "nite plans for war, but after the surrender at Munich, he was so convinced that Britain and",
  "France would remain passive again, that he decided to gamble on war with Poland.",
  "Chamberlain has also been criticized for choosing the wrong issue over which to make",

  "a stand against Hitler It is argued that German claims for Danzig and routes across the",
  "corridor were more reasonable than the demands for the Sudetenland (which contained",

  "almost a million non-Germans) Poland was difficult for Britain and France to defend and",
  "was militarily much weaker than Czechoslovakia. Chamberlain therefore should have",

  ".",
  "strong and had excellent fortifications",
  "Chamberlain\u2019sdefenders,on the other hand,claim that his main motive at Munich was",
  "to give Britain time to rearm for an eventual fight against Hitler. Arguably Munich did",
  "gain a crucial year during which Britain was able to press ahead with its rearmament",
  "programme. John Charmley, in his book Chamberlain and the Lost Peace (1989), argues",
  "that Chamberlain had very little option but to act as he did, and that Chamberlain\u2019s poli",
  "\u00ac",

  "Grand Alliance, including Britain, France, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Romania and the",
  "USSR. This idea was suggested at the time by Churchill, but Andrew Roberts (2006)",
  "argues that this was neveraserious possibility because of the many pointsof disagreement",

  "tarily weak. Russian historians justify the pact on the grounds that it gave the USSR time",
  ".",
  "to prepare its defences against a possible German attack",
  "(c) Was Hitler to blame?",
  "During and immediately after the war there was general agreement outside Germany that",
  "Hitler was to blame. By attacking Poland on all frontsinstead of merely occupying Danzig",
  "and the Corridor, Hitler showed that he intended not just to get back the Germans lost at",
  "Versailles, but to destroy Poland. Martin Gilbert argues that his motive was to remove the",
  "stigma of defeat in the First World War: \u2018for the only antidote to defeat in one war is",
  "victory in the next\u2019. Hugh Trevor-Roper and many other historians believe that Hitler",
  ".",
  "intended amajor war right from the beginning They argue that he hated communism and",
  "wanted to destroy Russia and control it permanently. In this way,Germany would acquire",
  "Lebensraum,but it could only be achieved by a major war. The destruction of Poland was",
  ".",
  "an essential preliminary to the invasion of Russia The German non-aggression pact with",
  "Russia was simply a way of lulling Russian suspicions and keeping her neutral until",
  ".",
  "Poland had been dealt with",
  "Evidence for this theory is taken from statements in Hitler\u2019s book Mein Kampf (My",
  "Struggle) and from the Hossbach Memorandum, a summary made by Hitler\u2019s adjutant,",
  "Colonel Hossbach, of a meeting held in November 1937, at which Hitler explained his",
  "expansionist plans to his generals. Another important source of evidence is Hitler\u2019s Secret",
  "Book,which he finished around 1928 but never published.",
  "If this theory iscorrect,appeasement cannot be blamed asa cause of war,except that it",
  ".",
  "made thingseasierfor Hitler Hitler had his plans, his \u2018blueprint\u2019 foraction,and this meant",
  ".",
  "that war wasinevitable sooner or later Germans,on the whole, were happy with thisinter",
  "\u00ac",
  "pretation too. If Hitler was to blame, and Hitler and the Nazis could be viewed as a kind",
  "of grotesque accident, a temporary \u2018blip\u2019 in German history, that meant that the German",
  "people were largely free from blame.",
  "Not everybody accepted this interpretation. A. J. P. Taylor, in his book The Origins of",
  "the Second World War (1961), came up with the most controversial theory about the",
  "outbreak of the war. He believed that Hitler did not intend to cause a major war, and",
  "expected at the most, a short war with Poland. According to Taylor, Hitler\u2019s aims were",
  "similar to those of previous German rulers- Hitler was simply continuing the policies of",
  "leaders like Bismarck, Kaiser Wilhelm II and Stresemann; the only difference was that",
  "Hitler\u2019s methods were more ruthless.Hitler wasa brilliantopportunist taking advantage of",
  "the mistakes of the appeasers and of events such as the crisis in Czechoslovakia in",
  ".",
  "February 1939 Taylor thought the German occupation of the rest of Czechoslovakia in",
  "March 1939 was not the result of a sinister long-term plan;\u2018it was the unforeseen by-prod",
  "\u00ac",
  "uct of events in Slovakia\u2019 (the Slovak demand for more independence from the Prague",
  ".",
  "government) Whereas Chamberlain miscalculated when he thought he could make Hitler",
  ".",
  "respectable and civilized, Hitler misread the minds of Chamberlain and the British How",
  "could Hitler foresee that the British and French would be so inconsistent as to support",
  "Poland (where his claim to land was more reasonable) after giving way to him over",
  "Czechoslovakia (where his case was much less valid)?",
  "Thus, for Taylor, Hitler was lured into the war almost by accident, after the Poles had",
  "called his bluff. \u2018The war of 1939, far from being premeditated, was a mistake, the result",
  "on both sides of diplomatic blunders.\u2019 Many people in Britain were outraged at Taylor",
  ".",
  "because they thought he was trying to \u2018whitewash\u2019 Hitler But Taylor was not defending",
  "Hitler;just theopposite,in fact-Hitler was still to blame,and so were theGerman people,",
  "INTERNATIONALRELATIONS, 1933-39 85.",
  "for being aggressive \u2018Hitler was the creation of German history and of the German",
  ".",
  "present He would have counted for nothing without the support and cooperation of the",
  "German people. ... Many hundred thousand Germans carried out his evil orders without",
  ".",
  "qualm or question\u2019",
  "Most recent interpretations have tended to play down Taylor\u2019s \u2018continuity\u2019 theory and",
  "highlight the differences in aims between earlier German rulers on the one hand, and",
  ".",
  "Hitler and the Nazis on the other Until 1937, Nazi foreign policy could be seen as typi",
  "\u00ac",
  "callyconservativeand nationalistic. It wasonly when all the wrongsof Versailles had been",
  "put right-the main aim of the conservativesand nationalists-that the crucial differences",
  "began to be revealed. The Hossbach memorandum shows that Hitler was preparing to go",
  ".",
  "much further and embark on an ambitious expansionist policy But there was more to it",
  "even than that. As Neil Gregor points out (2003), what Hitler had in mind was \u2018a racial",
  "war of destruction quite unlike that experienced in 1914-18\u2019. It began with the dismem",
  "\u00ac",
  "berment of Poland, continued with the attack on the USSR, and culminated in an horrific",
  "genocidal war- the destruction of the Jews and other groups which the Nazis considered",
  "inferior to the German master race; and the destruction of communism. \u2018Nazism was a",
  "destructive new force whose vision of imperial domination was radically different\u2019 from",
  ".",
  "anything that had gone before",
  "Another explanation of why Hitler decided to risk war in September 1939 was put",
  "forward by Adam Tooze in his book TheWagesof Destruction:The Making and Breaking",
  ".",
  "of the Nazi Economy (2006) His theory is that Hitler wasafraid that the longer he delayed",
  "the inevitable war, the greater the danger that Britain and France would overtake German",
  ".",
  "rearmament According to Tooze, \u2018Hitler knew that he would eventually have to confront",
  "the Western powers. And in the autumn of 1939 he attacked Poland because he had",
  "decided that he was willing to risk that wider war sooner rather than later. ... The military",
  "advantage that Germany currently enjoyed over its enemies was fleeting.\u2019 Germany had",
  "been steadily rearming,even before Hitler came to power. From 1936, when the Four Year",
  "Plan was introduced, until 1939, no less than two thirds of all investment in industry was",
  "for producing war materials. Richard Overy points out that in 1939 about a quarter of the",
  "industrial workforce was employed on military orders, \u2018a figure unmatched by any other",
  "state in Europe\u2019.The problem was that the German armaments industry was running short",
  "of raw materials, mainly because Germany\u2019s shortage of foreign exchange made it impos",
  "\u00ac",
  "sible to import sufficientquantitiesof iron and copper ore.Throughout the interwar period",
  "the Reichsmark was chronically overvalued, making exports uncompetitive. Hitler",
  "complained that Germany\u2019s enemies, egged on by their Jewish backers, had closed their",
  "borders to German exports.To make matters worse,in response to the German occupation",
  "of Prague, in March 1939 President Roosevelt of the USA placed punitive tariffs on",
  ".",
  "imports from Germany As Tooze explains:",
  "Hitler might have wished to fight the big war against Britain and France at a moment",
  "of his choosing at some point in the early 1940s, but by early 1939 the pace of events",
  "had rendered such long-term plans impractical. With America, France and Britain",
  ".",
  "appearing to grow ever closer together, there was no time to lose If Hitler\u2019s sworn",
  "enemies were improvising, so would he. It was time to wager everything. Otherwise,",
  "faced by aglobal coalition animated by itsimplacableJewish enemies,Germany would",
  ".",
  "face certain ruin",
  "What conclusion are we to reach? Today, over forty years after Taylor published his",
  "famous book, very few historians accept his theory that Hitler had no long-term plans for",
  "war. Some recent writers believe that Taylor ignored much evidence which did not fit in",
  ".",
  "with his own theory It is true that some of Hitler\u2019s successes came through clever oppor",
  "\u00ac",
  "tunism, but there was much more behind it than that. Although he probably did not have",
  "86",
  "PARTI WAR ANDINTERNATIONAL RELATIONS- - -",
  "a long term,detailed step by step plan worked out, he clearly had a basic vision, which he",
  ".",
  "was working towards at every opportunity That vision was a Europe dominated by",
  "Germany, and it could only be achieved by war. This is why there was so much emphasis",
  "on rearmament from 1936 onwards.Clearly Hitler intended much more than self-defence.",
  "There can be little doubt, then, that Hitler was largely responsible for the war. The",
  "German historian Eberhard Jackel, writing in 1984, claimed that",
  "Hitler set himself two goals:a war of conquest and the elimination of the Jews. ... [hisj",
  "ultimate goal was the establishment of a greater Germany than had ever existed before",
  "in history.The way to this greaterGermany wasa war of conquest fought mainly at the",
  "expense of Soviet Russia ... where the German nation was to gain living space for",
  "generations to come. ... Militarily the war would be easy because Germany would be",
  "opposed only by a disorganized country of Jewish Bolsheviks and incompetent Slavs.",
  "So it was probably not a world war that Hitler had in mind. Alan Bullock believed that he",
  "did not want a war with Britain;all he asked was that the British should not interfere with",
  "his expansion in Europe and should allow him to defeat Poland and the USSR in separate",
  ".",
  "campaigns Richard Overy agrees, pointing out that there is no evidence that Hitler ever",
  "thought of declaring war on Britain and France. He hoped to keep the war with Poland",
  "localized and then turn to the main campaign - the destruction of the USSR. Hitler was",
  "responsible for the war because he failed to realise that as far as Britain and France were",
  "concerned, the attack on Poland was one step too far.",
  "Hitler\u2019s most recent biographer, Ian Kershaw, sees no reason to change the general",
  "conclusion that Hitler must take the blame:",
  "Hitler had never doubted, and had said so on innumerable occasions, that Germany\u2019s",
  "future could only be determined through war. ... War-the essence of the Nazi system",
  "which had developed under his leadership-was for Hitler inevitable. Only the timing",
  "and direction were at issue. And there was no time to wait.",
