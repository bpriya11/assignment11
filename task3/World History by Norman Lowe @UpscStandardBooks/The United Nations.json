  "SUMMARY OF EVENTS",
  "The United Nations Organization (UNO) officially came into existence in October",
  ".",
  "1945 after the Second World War It was formed to replace the League of Nations,",
  "which had proved incapable of restraining aggressive dictators like Hitler and",
  "Mussolini. In setting up the UNO, the great powers tried toeliminate some of the weak",
  ". \u00ac",
  "nesses which had handicapped the League The UN Charter was drawn up in San",
  "Francisco in 1945, and was based on proposals made at an earlier meeting between the",
  ".",
  "USSR, the USA, China and Britain, held at Dumbarton Oaks (USA) in 1944 The aims",
  "of the UN are:",
  "(cid:127) to preserve peace and eliminate war;",
  "(cid:127) to remove the causes of conflict by encouraging economic, social, educational,",
  "-",
  "scientificand cultural progress throughout the world,especially in under developed",
  "countries;",
  "(cid:127)",
  "to safeguard the rightsof all individual human beings,and the rightsof peoplesand",
  "nations.",
  "In spite of the careful framing of the Charter, the UN was unable to solve many of the",
  "problems of international relations, particularly those caused by the Cold War. On the",
  "other hand it played an important role in a number of international crises by arranging",
  ".",
  "ceasefires and negotiations, and by providing peacekeeping forces Its successes in",
  "non-political work - care of refugees, protection of human rights, economic planning",
  "and attempts to deal with problems of world health, population and famine-have been",
  "enormous.",
  "9.1 THE STRUCTURE OF THE UNITED NATIONS ORGANIZATION",
  "There are now seven main organs of the UN:",
  "(cid:127)",
  "the General Assembly",

  "the Security Council",

  "the International Court of Justice",
  "(cid:127)",
  "the Trusteeship Council",
  "(cid:127) the Economic and Social Council",
  "(cid:127) the International Criminal Court (inaugurated in March 2003).",
  "THEUNITEDNATIONS ORGANIZATION 167(a) The General Assembly",
  "This is the meeting together of the representatives from all the member nations; each",
  "member can send up to five representatives, though there is only one vote per nation. It",
  "meetsonce a year, starting in September and remaining in session for about three months,",
  "but special sessions can be called in times of crisis by the members themselves or by the",
  ".",
  "Security Council Its function is to discuss and make decisions about international prob",
  "\u00ac",
  "lems, to consider the UN budget and what amount each member should pay, to elect the",
  ".",
  "Security Council members and to supervise the work of the many other UN bodies",
  ".",
  "Decisions do not need a unanimous vote as they did in the League Assembly Sometimes",
  "a simple majority is enough, though on issues which the Assembly thinks are very impor",
  "\u00ac",
  "tant, a two-thirds majority is needed. These include decisions about admitting new",
  "members or expelling existing members, and about actions to be taken to maintain peace.",
  "All speeches and debates are translated into six official UN languages-English, French,",
  ".",
  "Russian, Chinese, Spanish and Arabic",
  "(b) The Security Council",
  "Thissitsin permanentsession and itsfunction is to deal with crisesas they arise, by whatever",
  "action seems appropriate, and if necessary by calling on members to take economic or mili",
  "\u00ac",
  "taryactionagainstanaggressor.TheCouncil mustalsoapproveapplicationsfor UN member",
  "\u00ac",
  "ship, which then require a two-thirds majority in a vote of acceptance by the General",
  "Assembly.The Council began with eleven members,fiveof them permanent(China,France,",
  "USA, USSR and Britain), and the other six elected by the General Assembly for two-year",
  "terms. In 1965 the number of non-permanent members was increased to ten. Decisions need",
  "at least nine of the 15 members to vote in favour, but these must include all five permanent",
  "members;thismeans thatanyoneof the permanentmemberscanvetoadecisionand prevent",
  ".",
  "anyactionbeing taken In practice it hasgradually been accepted that abstention by a perma",
  "\u00ac",
  "nent member does not count asa veto, but this has not been written into the Charter.",
  "In order to secure some action in case of a veto by one of the permanent members, the",
  "General Assembly (at the time of the Korean War in 1950) introduced the \u2018Uniting for",
  "Peace\u2019 resolution; this stated that if the Security Council\u2019s proposals were vetoed, the",
  "Assembly could meet within 24 hours and decide what action to take,even military inter",
  "\u00ac",
  "vention if necessary. In cases like this,adecision by the Assembly would only need a two-",
  "thirds majority. Again this new rule was not added to the Charter, and the USSR, which",
  "used the veto more often than any other member, always maintained that a Security",
  "Council veto should take precedence over aGeneral Assembly decision. Nevertheless, the",
  ".",
  "Assembly acted in this way many times, ignoring Russian protests",
  "In 1950 a problem arose when the new communist People\u2019s Republic of China applied",
  "for UN membership. The USA vetoed the application, so that the Republic of China",
  "(Taiwan) retained its membership and its permanent seat on the Security Council. The",
  "USA blocked communist China\u2019s application every year for the next 20 years. In 1971,in",
  "an effort to improve relations with communist China, the USA at last refrained from veto",
  "\u00ac",
  "ing the application; consequently the General Assembly voted that the People\u2019s Republic",
  "of China should take over Taiwan\u2019s membership and permanent Security Council seat.",

  "Assembly on the recommendation of the Security Council In order to ensure some degree",
  "of impartiality, he is not from one of the major powers. He acts as the main spokesperson",
  "for the UN and is always at the forefront of international affairs, trying to sort out the",
  "world\u2019s problems. So far the post has been held by:",
  "Trygve Lie of Norway (1946-52)",
  "Dag Hammarskjold of Sweden (1952-61)",
  "U Thant of Burma (1961-71)",

  "Boutros Boutros Ghali of Egypt (1991-6)",
  "Kofi Annan of Ghana (1996-2006)",
  "Ban Ki-moon of South Korea (since 2006)",

  "The International Court of Justice at The Hague (in the Netherlands) has 15 judges, all of",
  "-",
  "different nationalities, elected for nine year terms (five retiring every third year) by the",

  "number of cases have been successfully dealt with, including a frontier dispute between",

  "Holland and Belgium and adisagreement between Britain and Norway overfishing limits",
  "In othercases, however,it was not so successful. In 1984for example,Nicaraguasued the",
  "USA for mining its harbours; the Court judged in favour of Nicaragua and ordered the",
  "USA to pay compensation. The USA refused to accept the verdict, and no further action",
  "was taken. Although in theory the Security Council has the power to take \u2018appropriate",

  "\u00ac",
  "ate successfully when both parties to a dispute agree to accept the verdict, whichever way",
  "it should happen to go.",
  "(e) The Trusteeship Council",
  "This replaced the League of Nations Mandates Commission, which had originally come",
  "into existence in 1919 to keep an eye on the territories taken away from Germany and",
  "Turkey at the end of the First World War. Some of these areas (known as mandated terri",
  "\u00ac",
  "tories or mandates) had been handed over to the victorious powers, and their job was to",
  "govern the territories and prepare them for independence (see Sections 2.8 and 2.10). The",
  "Trusteeship Council did its job well and by 1970 most of the mandates had gained their",
  "independence (see Sections 11.1(b) and Chapter 24).",
  "However, Namibia remained a problem, since South Africa refused to give the area",
  ".",
  "independence South Africa, ruled by a government representing the white minority of the",
  "population, was unwilling to give independence to a state right on its own frontier that",
  ".",
  "would be ruled by a government representing its black African majority The UN repeat",
  "\u00ac",
  "edly condemned South Africa for its attitude; in 1971 the International Court of Justice",
  "ruled thatSouth Africa\u2019soccupation of Namibia wasa breach of international law and that",
  ".",
  "South Africa must withdraw immediately South Africa ignored the UN, but as the other",
  "states of Africa gradually gained independence under black governments, it became more",
  "difficultforSouth Africato maintain both itsposition in Namibiaand itsown white minor",
  "\u00ac",
  ".",
  "ity rule (see Section 25.6(b-c) and 25.8(e)) At last in 1990 the pressure of black African",
  "nationalism and world opinion forced South Africa to release its grip on Namibia.",

  "THEUNITEDNATIONS ORGANIZATION(f) The Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC)",
  "This has 27 members, elected by the General Assembly, with one-third retiring each year.",
  "It organizes projects concerned with health, education and other social and economic",
  "matters. Its task is so enormous that it has appointed four regional commissions (Europe,",
  "LatinAmerica,Africa,Asia andthe Far East),as well ascommissionson population prob",
  "- \u00ac",

  "Health Organization (WHO), the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the United",
  "Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), the United Nations",

  "Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF) and the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA)",
  "The scope of ECOSOC expanded in such a remarkable way that by 1980 more than 90 per",
  ".",
  "cent of the UN\u2019s annual expenditure was devoted to ECOSOC activities (see Section 9.5)",
  "(g) The International Criminal Court (ICC)",
  "The idea of an International Criminal Court to try individuals accused of crimes against",
  "humanity wasfirstdiscussed by aLeague of Nationsconvention in 1937, but nothingcame",
  "of it. The Cold War prevented any further progress until, in 1989, it was suggested again",
  "- .",
  "as a possible way of dealing with drug traffickers and terrorists Progress towards the",
  "creation of a permanentcourt was again slow,and it was left to the Security Council to set",
  "up two special war crimes tribunals to try individuals accused of committing atrocities in",
  "1994 in Rwanda and in 1995 in Bosnia. The most high-profile case was that of Slobodan",
  "Milosevic, the former Yugoslav president (see Section 10.7), who was extradited from",
  "Belgrade and handed over to UNofficials in the Netherlands.His trial opened in July 2001",
  "in The Hague;hefaced chargesof committing crimesagainst humanity in Bosnia,Croatia",
  ".",
  "and Kosovo He was the first former head of state ever to be brought before an interna",
  "\u00ac",
  "tional court of justice.The trial dragged on for five for almost five years until he died of a",
  "heart attack before a verdict was reached.",
  "Meanwhile, in July 1998 an agreement known as the Rome Statute was signed by 120",
  "member states of the UN to create a permanent court to deal with war crimes, genocide",
  ".",
  "and other crimes against humanity The new court, consisting of 18 elected judges, was",
  "formally inaugurated in March 2003, and was based in The Hague. However, the US",
  "government did not like the idea that some of its citizens might be tried in the court -",
  "particularly Americans acting as peacekeepers who might find themselves open to \u2018politi",

  ".",
  "cized prosecutions\u2019 Although the Clinton administration had signed the 1998 agreement,",
  ".",
  "President Bush insisted that the signature should be withdrawn (May 2002) Consequently",
  "the USA did not recognize the ICCand by June 2003had signed separateagreements with",
  "37 states promising that no US personnel would be handed over to the ICC for trial. In",
  "some cases the USA threatened to withdraw economic or military aid if the state refused",
  ".",
  "to comply with its wishes",
  "9.2 HOW DIFFERENT IS THE UNITED NATIONS FROM THE LEAGUE",
  "OF NATIONS?",
  "(a) The UN has been more successful",
  "There are some important differences which have tended to make the UN a more success",
  "\u00ac",
  "ful body than the League.",
  "170",
  "PARTI WAR ANDINTERNATIONALRELATIONS(cid:127)",
  "The UN spends much more time and resourceson economic and social matters and",
  ".",
  "its scope is much wider than that of the League All the specialized agencies, with",
  "the exception of the International Labour Organization (founded in 1919), were set",
  "up in 1945 or later.",
  "(cid:127)",
  "The UN is committed to safeguarding individual human rights, which the League",
  ".",
  "did not get involved in",
  "(cid:127)",
  "Changes in the proceduresof the General Assembly and the Security Council (espe",
  "\u00ac",
  "cially the \u2018Uniting for Peace\u2019 resolution), and the increased power and prestige of",
  "-",
  "the Secretary General, have enabled the UN, on occasion, to take more decisive",
  "action than the League ever achieved.",
  "(cid:127) The UN has a much wider membership and is therefore more of a genuine world",
  "organization than the League, with all the extra prestige that this entails. Both the",
  "USA and the USSR were founder-members of the UN, whereas the USA never",
  "joined the League. Between 1963 and 1968 no fewer than 43 new members joined",
  "the UN, mainly the emerging states of Africa and Asia, and by 1985 membership",
  ".",
  "had reached 159; the League never had more than 50 members Later, many of the",
  "former member states of the USSR joined, and by 1993 the total had reached 183.",
  "In 2002,EastTimor, which hadat last gained itsindependencefrom Indonesia with",
  "UN help, became the 191st member. Montenegro joined in 2006 and in July 2011",
  "the newly independent Republic of South Sudan became the 193rd member.",
  "(b) Some of the weaknesses of the League remain",
  "Any one of the five permanent members of the Security Council can use its power of veto",
  ".",
  "to prevent decisive action being taken Like the League, the UN has no permanent army",
  ".",
  "of its own and has to use forces belonging to its member states (see Section 9.6)",
  "9.3 HOW SUCCESSFUL HAS THE UN BEEN AS A PEACEKEEPING",
  "ORGANIZATION?",
  "Although it has had mixed success, it is probably fair to say that the UN has been more",
  "successful than the League in its peacekeeping efforts,especially in crises which did not",
  "directly involve the interests of the great powers, such as the civil war in the Congo",
  "(1960-4) and the dispute between the Netherlands and Indonesia over West New Guinea.",
  "On the other hand, it has often been just as ineffective as the League in situations-such",
  "as the Hungarian rising of 1956 and the 1968 Czech crisis-where the interests of one of",
  "the great powers- in this case the USSR -seemed to be threatened, and where the great",
  "power decided to ignore or defy the UN. The best way to illustrate the UN\u2019s varying",
  ".",
  "degreesof success is toexamine some of the major disputes in which it has been involved",
  "(a) West New Guinea (1946)",
  "In 1946 the UN helped to arrange independence from Holland for the Dutch East Indies,",
  "which became Indonesia (see Map 24.3). However, no agreement was reached about the",
  "future of West New Guinea (West Irian), which was claimed by both countries. In 1961",
  "fighting broke out; after U Thant had appealed to both sides to reopen negotiations, it was",
  "agreed (1962) that the territory should become part of Indonesia. The transfer was orga",
  "\u00ac",
  "nized and policed by a UN force. In this case the UN played a vital role in getting negoti",
  "\u00ac",
  ".",
  "ations off the ground, though it did not itself make the decision about West Irian\u2019s future",
  "THEUNITEDNATIONS ORGANIZATION 171(b) Palestine (1947)",
  ".",
  "The dispute between Jews and Arabs in Palestine was brought before the UN in 1947",
  "After an investigation, the UN decided to divide Palestine, setting up the Jewish state of",
  ".",
  "Israel (see Section 11.2) This was one of the UN\u2019s most controversial decisions, and it",
  "was not accepted by the majority of Arabs.The UN was unable to prevent a series of wars",
  "between Israel and various Arab states(1948-9,1967 and 1973),though itdid useful work",
  "arranging ceasefires and providing supervisory forces, while the UN Relief and Works",
  ".",
  "Agency cared for the Arab refugees",
  "(c) The Korean War (1950-3)",
  "This was the only occasion on which the UN was able to take decisive action in a crisis",
  "directly involving theinterestsof one of the superpowers.When South Korea wasinvaded",
  "by communist North Koreain June 1950, the Security Council immediately passed a reso",
  "\u00ac",
  "lution condemning North Korea, and called on member states to send help to the South.",
  "However, this was possible only because of the temporary absence of the Russian dele",
  "\u00ac",
  "gates, who would have vetoed the resolution if they had not been boycotting Security",
  "Council meetings (since January of that year) in protest at the failure to allow communist",
  "China to join the UN. Although the Russian delegates returned smartly, it was too late for",
  "them to prevent action going ahead.Troopsof 16 countries were able to repel the invasion",
  ".",
  "and preserve the frontier between the two Koreasalong the 38th parallel (see Section 8.1)",
  "Though this was claimed by the West as a great UN success, it was in fact very much",
  "an American operation-the vast majorityof troopsand theCommander-in-Chief,General",
  "MacArthur, were American,and the USgovernment had already decided to intervene with",
  "force the day before the Security Council decision was taken. Only the absence of the",
  "Russiansenabled the USA to turn it into a UN operation.This wasa situation not likely to",
  "be repeated, since the USSR would take good care to be present at all future Council",
  ".",
  "sessions",
  "The KoreanWar had important results forthe future of the UN one was the passing of",
  "',",
  "the \u2018Uniting for Peace\u2019 resolution, which would permit a Security Council veto to be",
  "bypassed by aGeneral Assembly vote. Another was the launching of a bitterattack bythe",
  "Russians on Secretary-General Trygve Lie for what they considered to be his biased role",
  "in the crisis. His position soon became impossible and he eventually agreed to retire early,",
  ".",
  "to be replaced by Dag Hammarskjold",
  "(d) The Suez Crisis (1956)",
  "Thisarguably showed the UN at its best.When President Nasserof Egyptsuddenly nation",
  "\u00ac",
  "alized the Suez Canal, many of whose shares were owned by the British and French, both",
  "these powers protested strongly and sent troops \u2018to protect their interests\u2019 (see Section",
  ".",
  "11.3) At the same time the Israelis invaded Egypt from the east; the real aim of all three",
  "states was to bring down President Nasser. A Security Council resolution condemning",
  "force was vetoed by Britain and France, whereupon the General Assembly, by a majority",
  ".",
  "of 64 votes to 5, condemned the invasions and called for a withdrawal of troops In view",
  "of the weight of opinion against them, theaggressorsagreed to withdraw,provided the UN",
  "ensured a reasonable settlement over the canal and kept the Arabs and Israelis from",
  "slaughtering each other. A UN force of 5000, made up of troops from ten different coun",
  "\u00ac",
  "tries, moved in, while the British, French and Israelis went home. The prestige of the UN",
  "and of Dag Hammarskjold, who handled the operation with considerable skill, wasgreatly",
  "172",
  "PARTI WAR ANDINTERNATIONALRELATIONSenhanced, though American and Russian pressure was also important in bringing about a",
  ".",
  "ceasefire However, the UN was not so successful in the 1967 Arab-Israeli conflict (see",
  "Section 11.4).",
  "(e) The Hungarian Rising (1956)",
  "This took place at the same time as the Suez Crisis, and showed the UN at its most inef",
  "\u00ac",
  "fective. When the Hungarians tried to exert their independence from Russian control,",
  ".",
  "Soviet troopsentered Hungary to crush the revolt The Hungarian government appealed to",
  "the UN, but the Russians vetoed a Security Council resolution calling for a withdrawal of",
  "their forces. The General Assembly passed the same resolution and set up a committee to",
  "investigate the problem; but the Russians refused to co-operate with the committee and no",
  "progress could be made. The contrast with Suez was striking: there, Britain and France",
  "were willing to bow to international pressure; the Russians simply ignored the UN, and",
  "nothing could be done.",
  "(f) Civil war in the Congo (1960-4)",
  "Here the UN mounted its most complex operation to date (see Section 25.5), except for",
  "Korea. When the Congo (known as Zaire since 1971) dissolved into chaos immediately",
  "after gaining independence, a UN force numbering over 20 000 at its largest managed to",
  "restore some sort of precarious order. A special UN Congo Fund was set up to help with",
  "the recovery and development of the ravaged country. But the financial cost was so high",
  "that the UN was brought close to bankruptcy, especially when the USSR, France and",
  "Belgium refused to pay theircontributions towards the costof theoperations, because they",
  ".",
  "disapproved of the way the UN had handled the situation The waralsocost the lifeof Dag",
  "Hammarskjold, who was killed in a plane crash in the Congo.",
  "(g) Cyprus",
  "Cyprus has kept the UN busy since 1964. A British colony since 1878, the island was",
  "granted independence in 1960. In 1963civil war broke out between the Greeks, who made",
  "up about 80 per cent of the population, and the Turks. A UN peacekeeping force arrived",
  "in March 1964;an uneasy peace was restored, but it needed 3000 UN troops permanently",
  "stationed in Cyprus to prevent Greeksand Turks tearing each otherapart.That was not the",
  "end of the trouble, though:in 1974 theGreekCypriots tried to unite theisland withGreece.",
  "This prompted the Turkish Cypriots, helped by invading Turkish army troops, to seize the",
  "north of the island for their own territory. They went on to expel all Greeks who were",
  ".",
  "unfortunate enough to be living in that area The UN condemned the invasion but was",

  "ing the frontier between Greeks and Turks However, the UN hasstill not been successful",
  "in finding an acceptable constitution or any other compromise. The most recent attempt-",
  "the Annan Plan of 2004-was accepted by the Turks but rejected by the Greeks.",
  "(h) Kashmir",
  "In Kashmir the UN found itself in asimilar situation to the one in Cyprus. After 1947,this",
  "large province, lying between India and Pakistan (see Map 24.1) was claimed by both",
  "THEUNITEDNATIONS ORGANIZATION 173states. Already in 1948 the UN had negotiated a ceasefire after fighting broke out. At this",
  "point the Indians were occupying the southern part of Kashmir, the Pakistanis the north",
  "\u00ac",
  "ern part,and for the next 16 years the UN policed the ceasefire line between the two zones.",
  "When Pakistani troops invaded the Indian zone in 1965, a short war developed, but once",
  "again the UN successfully intervened and hostilities ceased. The original dispute still",
  "remained, however,and in 1999 there were violent clashes as Pakistanis again unsuccess\u00ac",
  "fully invaded the Indian zone.There seemed little prospect of the UN or any other agency",
  "finding a permanent solution.",
  "(i) The Czechoslovak crisis (1968)",
  "This was almost a repeat performance of the Hungarian rising 12 years earlier. When the",
  "Czechsshowed what Moscow considered to be too much independence,Russian and other",
  "Warsaw Pact troops were sent in to enforce obedience to the USSR.The Security Council",

  "(j) The Lebanon",
  "While civil war was ragingin the Lebanon (1975-87) matters werefurthercomplicated by",
  "a frontier dispute in the south of the country between Lebanese Christians (aided by the",
  "Israelis) and Palestinians. In March 1978 the Israelis invaded South Lebanon in order to",
  "destroy Palestinian guerrilla basesfrom which attacks were being made on northern Israel.",
  "In June 1978 the Israelis agreed to withdraw, provided the UN assumed responsibility for",
  ".",
  "policing the frontier area The United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL),",
  "consisting of about 7000 troops, was sent to South Lebanon. It supervised the Israeli with",
  "\u00ac",
  "drawal and had some success in maintaining relative peace in the area; but it was a",
  "constant struggle against frontier violations, assassinations, terrorism and the seizing of",
  ".",
  "hostages (see Section 11.8(b))",
  "During the early 1990s a new enemy began to harass Israel from bases in South",
  "Lebanon: this was the Muslim Shi\u2019ite group known as Hezbollah, which, according to",
  "the Israeli government, was backed by Iran and Syria. In retaliation the Israelis launched",
  "a major attack on South Lebanon (April 1996) and occupied most of the region until",
  "1999. Once again UNIFIL helped to supervise an Israeli withdrawal and the force was",
  "increased to around 8000. In 2002, as the region seemed calmer than for many years,",

  "UNIFIL was reduced to some 3000 UNIFIL worked hard to strengthen the Lebanese",

  "together to maintain stability, though a permanent solution still seemed far off In July",
  "2006 Hezbollah ambushed an Israeli patrol; eight Israeli soldiers were killed and two",

  "taken prisoner The Israelis responded immediately: demanding the return of the",
  "captured soldiers, they blockaded Lebanon from the sea, bombed Beirut and destroyed",

  "happened with the war in Vietnam (see Section 8.3) and the war in Angola (see Section",

  "In 1987 changes were introduced giving the main financial contributors more control",

  "Europeans felt that they already paid too much - the USA (with about 30 per cent), the",
