  "population had more than doubled to 1200 million (1.2 billion) After that, the population",
  "growth accelerated so rapidly that people talked about a population \u2018explosion\u2019;in 1927it",
  "reached the 2 billion mark. By the year 2000 it had passed 6 billion and at the end of 2011",

  "it reached 7 billion In 2003 the UN calculated that if the population continued to increase",
  "at the same rate, theglobal total would be somewhere between 10 billion and 14 billion by",
  "2050, depending on how effectively family planning campaigns were carried out. It was",

  "(a) Statistics of population increase",
  "It is easy to see from the steeply climbing population total in Figure 28.1 why people talk",
  "about a population \u2018explosion\u2019 in the twentieth century. Between 1850 and 1900 the",
  "world\u2019s population was increasing, on average, by 0.6 per cent every year. During the next",
  "50 years the rateof increaseaveraged0.9 percenta year;it wasafter 1960 that thefullforce",
  "of the \u2018explosion\u2019 was felt, with the total world population increasing at the rate of 1.9 per",

  "cent a year, on average In 1990 the population was increasing by roughly a million every",
  "week,and the total had reached 5300 million. In 1994 there was an increase of 95 million,",
  "the biggestever increase in asingle yearsofar. In 1995 the record was broken again,as the",
  "total population grew by 100 million to 5750 million. According to the Population Institute",
  "in Washington, 90 per cent of the growth was in poor countries \u2018torn by civil strife and",
  "social unrest\u2019. During 1996 a further90 million were added to the population,and by 2000",
  "the global total was well past 6 billion. It topped the 7 billion mark at the end of 2011.",
  "However, there were important regional variations within the general population",

  "their most rapid increase before the First World War; after that their rate of increase",
  "slowed considerably. In the less developed, or Third World nations of Africa, Asia and",

  "There was a great improvement in public health, thanks to advances in medical",

  "germs and antiseptic techniques helped to reduce the death rate. At the same time,",
  "the big industrial cities introduced piped water supplies and drainage schemes,",
  ".",
  "which all helped to reduce disease",
  "(cid:127) There was a decline in infant mortality (the number of babies who died before the",
  "age of I ). Again this was mainly thanks to medical improvements, which helped to",
  "reduce deaths from diseases such as scarlet fever,diphtheria and whooping cough,",
  "which were sodangerous to young babies.The improvement in somecountriescan",
  "be seen in Table 28.1, which shows how many babies per thousand bom, died",

  "years before 1914 they were arrivingat a rateof a million a year(seeSection 22.2)",
  "After 1900 the growth rate in Europe began to slow down, mainly because more people",
  "were using modern contraceptive techniques. Later, theeconomic depression of the 1930s",
  "discouraged people from having as many children.",

  "28.2 CONSEQUENCES OF THE POPULATION EXPLOSION",
  "(a) The industrializing nations of Europe and North America",
  "The population growth of the nineteenth century helped to stimulate further economic",
  "development. There was a plentiful workforce and more people to buy goods, and this",
  "encouraged more investment and enterprise. Nor were there any great problems about",
  "feeding and educating these growing numbers, because prosperity meant that the neces",
  "\u00ac",
  "sary resources were available. Later on, there were unexpected effectson the age structure",
  "of the population in the developed nations. This was especially true in Europe where,",
  "because of the very low birth ratesand longer life expectancy,a growing proportion of the",
  "population was over 65. By the 1970s, in countries such as Sweden, France and Britain,",
  ".",
  "about 15 per cent of the population were over 65 In the early 1990s, with this proportion",
  "still increasing,questions were being asked about whether state welfare systems would be",
  "able to afford to pay pensions to all old people if this trend continued into the twenty-first",
  ".",
  "century",
  "(b) The Third World",
  "The rapid population growth caused seriousproblems:some countries, like India,Pakistan",
  "and Bangladesh, became overcrowded and there was insufficient land to go round. This",
  "forced people to move into townsand cities, but these were alreadyovercrowded and there",
  "were not enough houses or jobs for all the new arrivals. Many people were forced to live",
  "on the streets;some cities, especially those in Latin America, were surrounded by shanty",
  "\u00ac",
  "towns and slums which had no proper water supply, sanitation or lighting.",
  "(c) It became increasingly difficult to feed the population",
  "All areasof the world succeeded in increasing their food production during the late 1960s",
  "and 1970s, thanks to what became known as the \u2018green revolution\u2019. Scientists developed",
  "new strains of heavy-cropping rice and wheat on short, fast-growing stems, helped by",
  ".",
  "fertilizers and irrigation schemes For a time, food supplies seemed to be well ahead of",
  "population growth; even a densely populated country like India was able to export food,",
  "and China became self-sufficient. In the USA crop yields increased threefold between",
  "1945 and 1995, and the Americans were able to export surplus crops to over a hundred",
  "countries. However, in the mid-1980s, with the world\u2019s population growing faster than",
  "ever, the \u2018green revolution\u2019 was running into problems and scientists became concerned",
  ".",
  "about the future",
  "(cid:127)",
  "A point had been reached beyond which crop yields could not be increased any",
  "further, and there was a limit to the water supply, topsoil and phosphates for fertil",

  "whichplayeda part in causing severe food shortagesand tensof thousandsof deaths from",
  "starvation",
  ".",
  "(d) Resource shortages in the Third World",
  "Third World governments were forced to spend their valuable cash to feed, house, and",
  "educate their growing populations. But this used up resources which they would have",
  "preferred to spend on industrializing and modernizing their countries, and so their",
  "economic development was delayed. The general shortage of resources meant that the",
  "poorest countries also lacked sufficient cash to spend on healthcare. Following a meningi\u00ac",
  "tisepidemic in the African state of Niger Save the Children reported (April 1996) that",
  ",",
  "one-sixth of the world's population - over 800 million people - had no access to health\u00ac",
  "care Health systems in many poorer countries were collapsing and the situation was",
  ". ,",
  "becoming worse because richer countries were reducing aid. The report estimated that it",
  "cost at least SI2 a person a year to provide basic healthcare; but 16 African countries",
  "(including Niger, Uganda, Zaire, Tanzania, Mozambique and Liberia) plus Bangladesh.",
  "India. Pakistan. Nepal and Vietnam were spending much less than that. In comparison.",
  "Britain wasspending theequivalent of $1039 (\u00a3723). In fact Zaire wasspending only 40c",
  "per head a year while Tanzania managed 70c. This meant that simple immunization",
  ",",
  "against easily preventable diseases was not being carried out in these countries.",
  "Widespread epidemics could be expected before the end of the century and a rise in the",
  ",",
  "child mortality rate. When the AIDS epidemic spread, around the turn of the century, it",
  "wasclear that Africa in particular would be in dire crisis Anotherdisturbing fact was that",
  ".",
  "almost all these states were spending vastly more per head on defence than on healthcare.",

  "governments recommended a maximum of three children, while the Chinese government",
  "went further and fixed the legal maximum at two children per family. But progress was",

  "continued to forbid artificial birth control",
  "(b) How successful were the campaigns?",

  "Table 28.3 shows the 1986 populations and growth rates of various regions, compared",
  "with the 1950-9 growth rates. The most rapid growth rate in 1986 was in Africa, where",
  "some countries had rates of over 3 per cent per year. The table also reveals how serious",
  "the problem of overcrowding was in some areas where there were on average over a",
  "hundred people toevery square kilometre.This was notso serious in thedeveloped nations",

  "encouraging; The most important news during the 1980s, perhaps, was that the popula\u00ac",
  "tion of China appeared virtually to have stabilised.'",
  "However thecaseof China raisesanother issue:how far should a government go in its",
  ",",
  "efforts to control population? In 1978 a group of scientists calculated that unless Chinese",
  "women were limited toonechild each,China would facedisaster- thecountry\u2019s resources",
  "would simply not be sufficient to feed the population.Conversely, if the one woman one-",
  "child limit could be achieved, then the Chinese would become prosperous and assume",
  "their rightful place among the world\u2019s leading nations. In 1980 the government duly",
  "announced the one-child policy. Historian Matthew Connelly describes what happened",
  "next:",
  ".",
  "This was the most coercive phase in the whole history of China\u2019s one-child policy ...",
  "-",
  "All women with one child were to be inserted with a stainless steel tamper resistant",
  ",",
  "IUD Jintra-uterine device) all parents with two or more children were to be sterilized",
  ", ,",
  "and all unauthorized pregnancies terminated. There was not even a pro forma injunc",
  "\u00ac",
  "tion toavoidcoercion. ... In 1983more than 16million women and more than 4 million",
  "men were sterilized in China, nearly 18 million women were inserted with lUDs, and",
  "over 14 million underwent abortions.",
  "There was widespread criticism of this policy in China itself. The All-China Women\u2019s",
  "Federation demanded an end to \u2018infanticide and the abuse of women\u2019. There was outrage",
  "-",
  "among Roman Catholicsand pro life supporters around the world, especially in the USA.",
  "Eventually the Chinese government softened the policy, but claimed that it had been",
  "successful,and was therefore justified. Now that China\u2019s population hasstabilized and the",
  "birth rate is even falling, this means that there are fewer people to share the available",
  "resources; therefore standards of living should rise and poverty should be reduced.",
  "However, some observers point out that although this in itself is a great achievement, it",
  ".",
  "does not solve the problems facing theecosystem. Matthew Connelly explains why using",
  "as an example some Asian countries which adopted population control policies;",

  "PART VI THECHANGING WORLDECONOMY SINCE|<XX)If Asians have only 2.1 children, but also air conditioning and automobiles, they will",

  "water, or wide open spaces",
  "This was borne out in a joint report by agroupof scientistsfrom 105institutions published",
  "shortly before the Earth Summit Conference of July 2012. This confirmed that one of the",
  "main causes of the rapid rise in consumption was \u2018the growing middle class in developed",

  "likely to trigger Springs in the rest of the poorest and most repressed countries?",
  "This last point was taken up by Paul Liotta and James Miskel, who highlight another",

  "of over 10 million. They calculate that by 2025 there will be at least 27 of these mega",

  "At the time Huntington was writing, it was becoming increasingly clear that Islamism",

  "set up an Islamic republic, was regarded by many in the West as a dangerous manifesta\u00ac",

  "kidnapped over 50 Americans and held them hostage for 444 days, in an attempt to force",
  "the US to hand over the formerShah who was living in exile in the USA.Then in October",
  "1981 President Sadat of Egypt was assassinated by members of a militant Islamic group,",
  "the Egyptian Islamic Jihad because they thought he was too pro-American and he had",
  ",",
  "made peace with the Israelis(seeSection 11.7). Islamism came to be regarded by many in",
  "the West as synonymous with terrorism, as a whole series of attacks took place on",
  "American targets (see Section 12.2(c)): US embassies in Beirut and Kuwait (1983 -",

  "control The widespread use of anti retroviral (ARV) drugs therapy slowed down the",
  ".",
  "development of the virus and enabled people to live much longer",
  "It wassomething of a shock when, during the 1990s, the world became aware that the",
  "disease had spread to the poorestcountries in the world,and that in Africa it had reached",
  "epidemic proportions. Scientists now know that it takes an average of eight to ten years",
  "for HIV infection to develop into full-blown AIDS, which was why the virus was able",
  "to spread so widely before it was recognized. The epidemic also spread to India, China",
  "and the countries of the former USSR.Tony Barnett and Alan Whiteside, in their recent",
  "book AIDS in the 21st Century (2002), showed how each epidemic was different: in",
  "China the main causes were contaminated needles and the practice of selling blood at",
  ".",
  "state-run blood collection points in the early 1990s The World Health Organization",
  "(WHO)estimated that two-thirdsof injectionsgivenin China were unsafe and that much",
  "of the collected blood plasma was infected. When the symptoms of AIDS began to",
  "appear, local officials tried to suppress the news. It was only in 2003 that the govern",
  "\u00ac",
  "-",
  "ment admitted publicly that over a million of its citizens were HIV positive; the infec",
  ". \u00ac",
  "tion was increasing by 30 per cent a year and 10 million could be affected by 2010 In",
  "Russia and Ukraine the highest rates were among injecting drug-users, especially those",
  "in prison. Experts calculate that once HIV enters the general population and infects",
  "around 5 per cent of adults, a general epidemic is likely to follow, as it has in southern",
  ".",
  "Africa",
  "THEWORLD\u2019S POPULATION 679(b) AIDS in southern Africa",
  "The first cases to be reported in Africa were in a fishing village in south-west Uganda, in",
  "the mid-1980s. The HIV virus spread rapidly, transmitted mainly by unprotected hetero",
  "\u00ac",
  "sexual sex. Governments were slow to realize the significance of what was happening and",
  "aid agencies made no provision for dealing with the disease in their assistance",

  "major war The report concentrated on Botswana, but it warned that the impact of AIDS",
  "on Africa as a whole was likely to be devastating within just a few years, if nothing was",
  "done about it. The report was not exaggerating: in 2001, 3 million people died from the",

  "tragic side effects of the pandemic was the huge numbers of children left without parents",
  "In Uganda there were over a million orphans; the WHO estimated that by 2010 there were",
  "likely to be 20 million AIDS orphans in Africa. There were economic effects too: a",
  "substantial proportion of the labourforce was being lost, with all its skillsand experience.",
  "This was being feltespecially in farming and food production, while the deathsof so many",
  "young women was an irreplaceable loss to the domestic economy and to child-rearing. At",
  "the same time there was an increased demand for people to nurse the sick and care for",

  "orphaned children",
  "Why was the epidemic so much worse in southern Africa?",
  "HIV wasable to spread more quickly in conditions of poverty, where there was very little",
  ".",
  "access to information and education about the virus and how to prevent it spreading",
  "Widespread hunger reduced resistance to the disease and accelerated the progress from",
  "HIV to AIDS. Nor were any of the expensive anti-retroviral drugs available for Africans.",
  "The large number of civil wars in Africa produced thousands of refugees, who were often",
  "cutoff from their normal healthcare services. In emergency situations like these, there was",
  "a greater danger of the HIV virus being spread through contaminated blood. Most African",
  "governments took a long time to acknowledge what was happening, partly because of the",
  "stigma attached to the disease: the belief that it was caused by homosexual sex and the",
  "general reluctance to discuss sexual habits. South Africa itself was one of the slowest to",
  "take action, mainly because President Mbeki refused to accept the link between HIV and",

  "(c) What is being done to combat AIDS?",
  "The experts know what needs to be done to bring the AIDS epidemic under control:",
  "people must be persuaded to have safe sex and use condoms;and somehow governments",
  "must be able to provide cheap ARV treatment. Brazil is one country where the campaign",
  "has slowed down the spread of the disease. In Africa, governments have concentrated on",
  "the so-called \u2018ABC\u2019 message: \u2018Abstain from sex. Be faithful to one partner, and if you",

  "passed itsacute stage, but the problem of orphaned children was just reaching its height.",
  "V Elsewhere in Africa and China, governments were slow off the mark and the epidemic",
  "took a firmer hold, reaching crisis proportions in 2003. Some African countries were",
  "beginning to follow Uganda's example. In Malawi, President Muluzi set up an AIDS",
  "commission and appointed a special minister to deal with the problem. But huge sums of",
  "money are needed to finance the necessary three-pronged attack on HIV/AIDS across",

  "AIDS Day, but the outlook was bleak. Reports from all over the Third World showed that",

  "people were living with HIV. The UN Fund said it would need \u00a37 billion by 2005 and the",
  "WHO",
  "wanted \u00a34 billion. Many wealthy countries have given generously; the USA, for",
  "example, has promised $15 billion over the next five years, but insists that the money be",
  "spent in the way it specifies. The Bush administration favoured programmes which",
  "promoted abstinence against those that advocated the use of condoms. The Roman",
  "CatholicChurch alsocontinues tooppose the useof condoms,even though scientists have",
  "shown that it is the best meansof prevention available. No wonder Kofi Annan wasangry;",
