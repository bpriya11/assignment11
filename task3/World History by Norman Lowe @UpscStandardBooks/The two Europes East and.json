  "(c) Britain holds back",
  "It was ironic that, although Churchill had been one of the strongest supporters of the idea",
  "of a unified Europe, when he became prime ministeragain in 1951,he seemed to have lost",
  "any enthusiasm he might have had for Britain\u2019s membership of it. Anthony Eden\u2019s",
  "Conservative government (1955-7) decided not to sign the 1957 Treaty of Rome. There",

  "were several reasons for the British refusal to join The main objection was that if they",

  "joined the Community they would no longer be in complete control of theireconomy The",
  "European Commission in Brussels would be able to make vital decisions affecting",
  "Britain\u2019s internal economic affairs. Although the governments of the other six states were",
  "prepared to make this sacrifice in the interests of greater overall efficiency, the British",

  "On the other hand, Britain and some of the other European states outside the EEC were",

  "nating the Community If Britain came in, she would be a serious rival",
  "(cid:127) De Gaulle was not happy about Britain\u2019s \u2018American connection\u2019, believing that",
  "because of these close ties with the USA, Britain\u2019s membership would allow the",
  "USA to dominate European affairs. It would produce, he said, \u2018a colossal",
  "Atlantic grouping under American dependence and control\u2019. He was annoyed",
  "that the USA had promised to supply Britain with Polaris missiles but had not",
  "made the same offer to France. He was determined to prove that France was a",
  "great power and had no need of American help. It was this friction between",
  "France and the USA that eventually led de Gaulle to withdraw France from",
  ".",
  "NATO (1966)",
  "(cid:127) Finally there was the problem of French agriculture: the EEC protected its farmers",
  "with high tariffs (import duties) so that prices were much higher than in Britain.",
  "Britain\u2019s agriculture was highly efficient and subsidized to keep prices relatively",
  ".",
  "low If this continued after Britain\u2019s entry, French farmers, with their smaller and",

  "from the Commonwealth",
  "Meanwhile the EEC success story continued, without Britain. The Community\u2019s exports",
  "grew steadily,and the valueof itsexports wasconsistently higher than its imports. Britain,",
  "on the other hand, usually had a balance of trade deficit,and in 1964 was forced to borrow",
  "heavily from the IMF to replenish rapidly dwindling gold reserves. Once again, in 1967,",
  "de Gaulle vetoed Britain\u2019s application for membership.",
  "(f) The Six becomes the Nine (1973)",
  "Eventually, on 1 January 1973, Britain, along with Eire and Denmark, was able to enter",

  "following",
  "(a) The Lome Convention (1975)",
  "- -",
  "From the beginning the EC was criticized for being too inward looking and self centred,",
  "and forapparently showing no interest in using any of its wealth to help the world\u2019s poorer",
  "nations. This agreement, worked out in Lome, the capital of Togo in West Africa, did",
  "something to offset criticism, though many critics argued that it was too little. It allowed",
  "goods produced in over40 countriesin Africaand the Caribbean,mostly former European",
  ".",
  "colonies, to be brought into the EEC free of duties; it also promised economic aid Other",
  "poor Third World countries were added to the list later.",
  "(b) Direct elections to the European parliament (1979)",
  "Although it had been in existence for over 20 years by this time, the EC was still remote",
  "from ordinary people.One reasonfor introducing elections was to try toarouse more inter",
  "\u00ac",
  "est and bring ordinary people into closer contact with the affairs of the Community.",
  "The first elections took place in June 1979, when 410 Euro-MPs were chosen. France,",
  "Italy, West Germany and Britain were allowed 81 each, the Netherlands 25, Belgium 24,",
  "Denmark 16, Eire 15 and Luxembourg 6. The turnout varied widely from state to state. In",
  "Britain it was disappointing - less than a third of the British electorate were interested",

  "enough to bother going along to vote In some othercountries, however, notably Italy and",
  "Belgium, the turnout was over 80 per cent. Overall, in the new European parliament, the",

  "right-wing and centre parties had a comfortable majority over the left",
  "Elections were to be held every five years; by the time the nextelections came along in",
  "1984, Greece had joined the Community. Like Belgium, Greece was allowed 24 seats,",
  ".",
  "bringing the total to 434 Overall, in the European parliament the parties of the centre and",

  "right still kept a small majority The turnout of voters in Britain was again disappointing",
  "at only 32 per cent, whereas in Belgium it was 92 per cent and in Italy and Luxembourg it",
  ".",
  "wasover 80 per cent However,in these three countries it was more or lesscompulsory to",
  "vote.The highest turnout in acountry where voting was voluntary was57 per cent in West",
  ".",
  "Germany",
  "(c) The introduction of the Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM) (1979)",
  "This was introduced to link the currenciesof the member states in order to limit the extent",
  "to which individual currencies (the Italian lira, the French, Luxembourg and Belgian franc",
  ".",
  "and the German mark) could change in value against the currencies of other members A",
  "state\u2019s currency could change in value depending on how well its domestic economy was",

  "performing: a strong economy usually meant a strong currency It was hoped that linking",
  "the currencies would help to control inflation and lead eventually to a single currency for",
  "the whole of the EC. Initially Britain decided not to take the pound sterling into the ERM;",

  "the Community For further increases, see Section 10.8",
  "(e) Britain and the EC budget",
  "During the early years of their membership, many British people were disappointed that",

  "that year was to be \u00a31209 million, whereas West Germany\u2019s was \u00a3699 million and France",
  "only had to pay \u00a313 million. Britain protested that her contribution was ridiculously high,",
  "given the general state of her economy. The difference was so great because of the way",
  "the budget contribution was worked out: this took into consideration the amount of import",
  "duties received by each governmentfrom goodscoming into that country from outside the",
  "EC; a proportion of those duties received had to be handed over as part of the annual",
  "budget contribution. Unfortunately for the British, they imported far more goodsfrom the",
  "outside world than any of the other members, and this was why her payment was so high.",
  "After some ruthless bargaining by Britain\u2019s prime minister, Margaret Thatcher,acompro",
  "\u00ac",

  "(f) The 1986 changes",
  "Encouraging developments occurred in 1986 when all 12 members, working closely",
  "together, negotiated some important changes which,it was hoped, would improve the EC.",
  "They included:",
  "(cid:127)",
  "a move to a completely free and common market (no restrictions of any kind on",
  "internal trade and movement of goods) by 1992;",
  "(cid:127)",
  "more EC control over health, safety, protection of the environment and protection",
  "for consumers;",
  "(cid:127) more encouragement for scientific research and technology;",
  "(cid:127)",
  "more help for backward regions;",
  "(cid:127)",
  "the introduction of majority voting on many issues in the Council of Ministers; this",
  "would prevent a measure from being vetoed just by one state which felt that its",
  "national interests might be threatened by that measure;",
  "(cid:127)",
  "more powers for the European parliament so that measures could be passed with",
  ".",
  "less delay This meant that the domestic parliaments of the member states were",
  "gradually losing some control over their own internal affairs.",
  "Those people whofavoured afederal United Statesof Europe were pleased by the last two",
  "points, but in some of the member states, especially Britain and Denmark, they stirred up",
  "the old controversy about national sovereignty. Mrs Thatcher upset some of the other",
  "European leaders when she spoke out against any movement towards a politically united",
  "Europe: \u2018a centralized federal government in Europe would be a nightmare; co-operation",
  "with the other European countries must not be at the expense of individuality, the national",
  ".",
  "customs and traditions which made Europe great in the past\u2019",
  "(g) The Common Agricultural Policy (CAP)",
  "One of the most controversial aspects of the EC was its Common Agricultural Policy",
  "(CAP). In order to help farmers and encourage them to stay in business, so that the",
  "Community could continue to produce much of its own food, it was decided to pay them",
  "subsidies (extra cash to top up their profits). This would ensure them worthwhile profits",
  "and at the same time would keep prices at reasonable levels for the consumers. This was",
  "such agood deal for thefarmers that they were encouraged to producefar more than could",
  "THETWOEUROPES,EAST ANDWESTSINCE 1945 199be sold. Yet the policy was continued, until by 1980 about three-quarters of the entire EC",
  "budget was being paid out each year in subsidies to farmers. Britain, the Netherlands and",
  "West Germany pressed for a limit to be placed on subsidies, but the French government",
  "was reluctant to agree to this because it did not want to upset French farmers, who were",
  "doing very well out of the subsidies.",
  "In 1984, maximum production quotas were introduced for thefirst time, but thisdid not",
  ". .",
  "solve the problem By 1987 the stockpiling of produce had reached ludicrous proportions",
  "There was a vast wine \u2018lake\u2019 and a butter \u2018mountain\u2019 of one and a half million tonnes -",
  ".",
  "enough to supply the entire EC for a year There was enough milk powder to last five",
  "years,and storagefeesalone were costing \u00a31 million aday.Efforts toget rid of the surplus",
  "included selling it off cheaply to the USSR, India, Pakistan and Bangladesh, distributing",
  "butter free of charge to the poor within the Community,and using it to make animal feed.",
  "Some of the oldest butter was burnt in boilers.",
  "All this helped to cause a massive budget crisis in 1987: the Community was \u00a33billion",
  ".",
  "in the red and had debtsof \u00a310 billion In a determined effort to solve the problem, theEC",
  "introduced a harsh programme of production curbs and a price freeze to put a general",
  "squeeze on Europe\u2019s farmers. This naturally caused an outcry among farmers, but by the",
  "end of 1988 it was having some success and the surpluses were shrinking steadily.",
  "Member states were now beginning to concentrate on preparing for 1992 when the intro",
  "\u00ac",
  "duction of the single European market would bring the removal of all internal trading",
  ".",
  "barriers, and, some people hoped, much greater monetary integration",
  "(h) Greater integration: the Maastricht Treaty (1991)",
  "A summit meeting of all the heads of the member states was held in Maastricht",
  "(Netherlands) in December 1991, and an agreement was drawn up for \u2018a new stage in the",
  ".",
  "processof creatingan even closer unionamong the peoplesof Europe\u2019 Someof the points",
  "agreed were:",
  "(cid:127)",
  "more powers for the European parliament;",
  "(cid:127)",
  "greater economic and monetary union, to culminate in the adoption of a common",
  "currency (the euro) shared by all the member states, around the end of the century;",
  "(cid:127) a common foreign and security policy;",
  "(cid:127) a timetable to be drawn up of the stages by which all this would be achieved.",
  "Britain objected very strongly to the ideas of a federal Europe and monetary union, and to",
  "a whole section of the Treaty known asthe Social Chapter,which wasa list of regulations",
  "designed to protect people at work. There were rules about:",
  "(cid:127) safe and healthy working conditions;",
  "(cid:127)",
  "equality at work between men and women;",
  "(cid:127) consulting workers and keeping them informed about what was going on;",
  "(cid:127) .",
  "protection of workers made redundant",
  "Britain argued that these measures would increase production costs and therefore cause",
  "unemployment. The other members seemed to think that proper treatment of workers was",
  "moreimportant. In the end, because of British objections,theSocial Chapter was removed",
  "from the Treaty and it was left to individual governments to decide whetheror not to carry",
  "them out. The rest of the Maastricht Treaty, without the Social Chapter, had to be ratified",
  "(approved) by the national parliaments of the 12 members, and this had been achieved by",
  "October 1993.",

  "PARTI WAR ANDINTERNATIONAL RELATIONSThe French, Dutch and Belgian governments supported the Treaty strongly because",
  "they thought it was the best way to makesure that the powerof the reunified Germany was",

  "contained and controlled within the Community The ordinary people of the Community",
  "were not as enthusiastic about the Treaty as their leaders. The people of Denmark at first",
  "voted against it, and it took determined campaigning by the government before it was",
  "approved by a narrow majority in a second referendum (May 1993). The Swiss people",
  "voted not to join the Community (December 1992), and so did the Norwegians; even in",
  "the French referendum the majority in favour of Maastricht was tiny. In Britain, where the",

  "By the mid 1990s,afteralmost40 yearsof existence,the European Community (known",

  "THETWOEUROPES,EAST ANDWESTSINCE 194510.5 COMMUNIST UNITY IN EASTERN EUROPE",
  "The communist countries of eastern Europe were joined in a kind of unity under the lead",
  "\u00ac",
  "ership of the USSR. The main difference between the unity in eastern Europe and that in",
  "the west was that the countries of eastern Europe were forced into it by the USSR (see",
  "Section 7.2(d), (e), (g)), whereas the members of the EC joined voluntarily. By the end of",
  "1948 there were nine states in the Communist bloc: the USSR itself, Albania, Bulgaria,",
  "Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Hungary, Poland, Romania and Yugoslavia.",
  "(a) Organization of the Communist bloc",
  "Stalin set about making all the states into carbon copies of the USSR, with the same polit",
  "\u00ac",
  "ical, economic and educational systems, and the same Five Year Plans. All had to carry",
  "out the bulk of their trade with Russia, and their foreign policies and armed forces were",
  "controlled from Moscow.",
  "1 The Molotov Plan",
  "This was the first Russian-sponsored step towards an economically united Eastern bloc.",
  "The idea of the Russian foreign minister,Molotov,it wasa response to the American offer",
  ".",
  "of Marshall Aid (seeSection 7.2(e)) Since the Russians refused toallow any of their satel",
  "\u00ac",
  "lites to accept American aid, Molotov felt they had to be offered an alternative. The Plan",
  "was basically a set of trade agreements between the USSR and its satellites, negotiated",
  "during the summer of 1947; it was designed to boost the trade of eastern Europe.",
  "2 The Communist Information Bureau (Cominform)",
  "This was set up by the USSR at the same time as the Molotov Plan. All the communist",
  "states had to become members and its aim was political: to make sure that all the govern",
  "\u00ac",
  "ments followed the same line as the government of the USSR in Moscow. To be commu",
  "\u00ac",
  "nist was not enough; it had to be Russian-style communism.",
  "3 The Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (COMECON)",
  "COMECON was set up by the USSR in 1949. The aim was to help plan the economies of",
  "the individual states. All industry was nationalized (taken over by the state), and agricul",
  ". \u00ac",
  "ture was collectivized (organized into a system of large, state-owned farms) Later, Nikita",
  "Khrushchev (Russianleader 1956-64) tried to useCOMECON toorganize theCommunist",
  "bloc into a single, integrated economy; he wanted East Germany and Czechoslovakia to",
  "develop as the main industrial areas, and Hungary and Romania to concentrate on agri",
  "\u00ac",
  "culture. However, this provoked hostile reactions in many of the states and Khrushchev",
  "had to change his plans to allow more variations within the economies of the different",
  "countries. The Eastern bloc enjoyed some success economically, with steadily increasing",
  "production. However, their average GDP (see Section 10.4(e) for an explanation of GDP)",
  "and general efficiency were below those of the EC. Albania had the doubtful distinction",
  ".",
  "of being the most backward country in Europe In the 1980s the economies of the Eastern",
  "bloc states experienced difficulties, with shortages, inflation and a fall in the standard of",
  ".",
  "living",
  "Even so, the Communist bloc had a good record in social services; in some eastern",
  "European countries, health services were as good as, if not better than those in some EC",
  "countries. Forexample, in Britain in 1980 there was,on average,one doctorfor every 618",
  "people;in the USSR there wasonedoctorforevery 258 people,and in Czechoslovakiathe",

  "wanted to be free to trade with the westas wellas with the USSR.Stalin thereforeexpelled",
  "Yugoslavia from the Cominform and cut off economic aid, expecting that the country",
  "would soon be ruined economically and that Tito would be forced to resign. However,",
  "Stalin had miscalculated: Tito was much too popular to be toppled by outside pressures,",
  "and so Stalin decided it would be too risky to invade Yugoslavia.Tito was able to remain",

  "making the decisions which closely affected their own lives, both at work and in the",

  "to be communist,after 74 years. Why did this dramatic collapse take place?",
  "(a) Economic failure",

  "the Communist Party leaderships refused to admit that the working class lived in more",

  "producer of steel, fuel and energy, should be suffering shortages because of waste and",
  "inefficiency (see Section 18.3 for the situation in the USSR). He hoped to save commu",

  "ness) and perestroika (economic and social reform) Criticism of the system was",
  "encouraged in the drive for improvement, provided nobody criticized the Communist",
  "Party. He also helped to engineer the overthrow of the old-fashioned, hardline communist",
  "leaders in Czechoslovakia, and he was probably involved in plotting the overthrow of the",

  "\u00ac",

  "under US direction, working through NATO, not independently.",
  "Before the Treaty of Nice could be put into operation in January 2005, it had to be",
  "approved by all 15 member states. It was therefore a serious blow when, in June 2001,",
  "Ireland voted in a referendum to reject it. Ireland had been one of the most co-operative",
  "and pro-European members of the Union; but the Irish resented the fact that the changes",

  "The EU leaders were quick to declare solidarity with the USA and to promise all",

  "to the Iraq situation did not bode well for the prospects of formulating a common",
  "foreign and defence policy, as required by the new EU constitution due to be",
  "debated in December 2003.",
  "(cid:127) A rift of a different sort opened up over budgetary matters. In the autumn of 2003",
  "it was revealed that both France and Germany had breached the EU rule, laid down",
  "at Maastricht, that budget deficits must not exceed 3per cent of GDP. However, no",
  "action was taken: the EU finance ministers decided that both states could have an",

  "\u00ac",
  "tions: what would happen if smaller countries broke the rules - would they be let",
  "off too? If so, wouldn\u2019t that make a mockery of the whole budgetary system? Was",
  "the 3 per cent limit realistic anyway in a time of economic stagnation?",
  "(cid:127)",
  "The most serious blow - in December 2003 - came when a summit meeting in",
  "Brussels collapsed without reaching agreement on the new EU constitution, which",
  "was designed to streamline and simplify the way the Union worked. Disagreement",
  ".",
  "over the issue of voting powers was the main stumbling block",
  "Failure to agree on the new constitution was not a total disaster; the enlargement of the",
  "EU was still able to go ahead as planned on 1 May 2004; the ten new members were the",
  "Czech Republic, Cyprus, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Slovakia",
  "and Slovenia. But it was clear that the future of the Union was going to be fraught with",
  "problems. With some 25or more members todeal with,the main issue was how to balance",
  "the interestsof thesmallerand largerstates. Happily,mostof the problemsseemed to have",
  "been overcome when, in June 2004,a Constitutional Treaty wasdrawn up,to be presented",

  "to member states for ratification The new constitution was something of a triumph: it",

  "Union if they chose to; and states kept their veto on taxation, foreign policy and defence",
  "The areas over which the EU had overriding control were competition policy, customs,",
  "trade policy and protection of marine life. The dispute over the voting system was also",
  "resolved: for a measure to pass, it must be supported by at least 15 countries representing",
  "65 per cent of the EU\u2019s total population of 455 million; at least four countries with 35 per",

  "In a referendum held in June 2008 well over half the Irish voters rejected the Lisbon",

  "Sarkozy announced that the Irish must hold a second referendum Before this took place,",
  "the economic situation in Europe had changed dramatically: in September 2008 in the",
  "USA there occurred the worst financial collapse since the Wall Street Crash of 1929 (see",
  "Section 27.7-8). The effects soon spread to Europe; by the end of 2008 the demand for",
  "European exports had contracted alarmingly, and one by one the member statesof the EU",
  "plunged into recession. Worst affected were Spain and Ireland, the two countries which",
  "had enjoyed the highest growth rates in the EU since the introduction of the euro in 2002.",
  "As Perry Anderson explains:",
  "The crisis struck hardest of all in Ireland, where output contracted by 8.5 per cent",

  "of Europe\u2019s ordinary citizens In a move which boded well for the future, the European",

  "However, by that time the EU was facing two further problems: immigration and the",

  "According to Perry Anderson, in 2009 the overall inflow of migrants into Europe was",
  "some 1.7 million a year.",
  "Poverty and unemployment in these communities is nearly always above the national",
