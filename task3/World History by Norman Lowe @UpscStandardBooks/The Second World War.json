  "SUMMARY OF EVENTS",
  "Unlike the 1914-18 war, the Second World War was a war of rapid movement; it was a",
  "much more complex affair, with major campaigns taking place in the Pacific and the Far",
  "East, in North Africa and deep in the heart of Russia, as well as in central and western",
  "Europe and the Atlantic. The war falls into four fairly clearly defined phases:",
  "1 Opening moves: September 1939 to December 1940",
  ".",
  "By the end of September the Germans and Russians had occupied Poland After a five-",
  "month pause (knownas the \u2018phoney war\u2019),German forcesoccupied Denmark and Norway",
  "(April 1940). In May,attacks were made on Holland, Belgium and France, who were soon",
  "defeated, leaving Britain alone to face the dictators (Mussolini had declared war in June,",
  "just before the fall of France). Hitler\u2019s attempt to bomb Britain into submission was",
  "thwarted in the Battle of Britain (July to September 1940), but Mussolini\u2019sarmiesinvaded",
  "Egypt and Greece.",
  "2 The Axis offensive widens: 1941 to the summer of 1942",
  "The war now began to develop intoa worldwide conflict. First Hitler,confidentof a quick",
  "victory over Britain,launched an invasion of Russia (June 1941), breaking the non-aggres",
  "\u00ac",
  "sion pactsigned less than two yearsearlier.Then the Japaneseforced the USA into the war",
  "by attacking the American naval baseat Pearl Harbor(December 1941),and they followed",
  "this up by occupying territories such as the Philippines, Malaya, Singapore and Burma,",
  "scattered over a wide area. At thisstage of the war there seemed to be no way of stopping",
  ".",
  "the Germans and Japanese, though the Italians were less successful",
  "3 The offensives held in check: summer 1942 to summer 1943",
  "This phase of the war saw three important battles in which Axis forces were defeated.",
  "(cid:127) In June 1942, the Americansdrove off a Japanese attack on Midway Island, inflict",
  "\u00ac",

  "ing heavy losses",
  "(cid:127)",
  "In October, the Germans under Rommel, advancing towards Egypt, were halted at",
  ".",
  "El Alamein and later driven out of North Africa",
  "(cid:127)",
  "The third battle was in Russia, where by September 1942, the Germans had pene",
  "\u00ac",
  "trated as far as Stalingrad on the river Volga. Here the Russians put up such fierce",
  "resistance that in the following February the German army was surrounded and",
  "forced to surrender.",
  "Meanwhile the war in the air continued, with both sides bombing enemy cities, while at",
  "sea, as in the First World War, the British and Americans gradually got the better of the",
  "German submarine menace.",
  "THESECONDWORLDWAR 1939^5 89",
  ",4 The Axis powers defeated: July 1943 to August 1945",
  "The enormous power and resources of the USA and the USSR, combined with an all-out",
  "effort from Britain and her Empire, slowly but surely wore the Axis powers down. Italy",
  "was eliminated first,and this was followed by an Anglo-American invasion of Normandy",
  "(June 1944) which liberated France, Belgium and Holland.Later, Allied troopscrossed the",
  ".",
  "Rhine and captured Cologne In the east, the Russians drove the Germans out and",
  "advanced on Berlin via Poland. Germany surrendered in May 1945 and Japan in August,",
  ".",
  "after the Americans had dropped an atomic bomb on Hiroshima and one on Nagasaki",
  "6.1 OPENING MOVES: SEPTEMBER 1939 TO DECEMBER 1940",
  "(a) Poland defeated",
  "The Poles were defeated swiftly by the German Blitzkrieg (lightning war), which they",
  "were ill-equipped to deal with. It consisted of rapid thrusts by motorized divisions and",
  "tanks (Panzers) supported by air power. The Luftwaffe (the German air force) put the",
  ".",
  "Polish railway system out of action and destroyed the Polish air force Polish resistance",
  "was heroic but hopeless: they had no motorized divisions and they tried to stop advancing",
  "German tanks by massed cavalry charges. Britain and France did little to help their ally",
  "directly becauseFrench mobilization procedure was slow and out-of-date,and it wasdiffi",
  "\u00ac",
  "cult to transport sufficient troops to Poland to be effective. When the Russians invaded",
  ".",
  "eastern Poland, resistance collapsed On 29 September Poland was divided up between",
  ".",
  "Germany and the USSR (as agreed in the pact of August 1939)",
  "(b) The 'phoney war'",
  "Very little happened in the westfor the nextfive months. In the east the Russians tookover",
  "Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania and invaded Finland (November 1939),forcing her to hand",
  "over frontier territories which would enable the Russians to defend themselves better",
  "against any attack from the west. Meanwhile the French and Germans manned their",
  "respectivedefences-the Maginotand Siegfried Lines.Hitler seems to have hoped that the",
  "pause would weaken the resolve of Britain and France and encourage them to negotiate",
  "peace. This lack of action pleased Hitler\u2019s generals, who were not convinced that the",
  "German army was strong enough to attack in the west. It was the American press which",
  "described this period as the \u2018phoney war\u2019.",
  "(c) Denmark and Norway invaded April 1940",
  ",",
  "Hitler\u2019s troops occupied Denmark and landed at the main Norwegian ports in April 1940,",

  "try to take over some of Norway\u2019s ports, which they were in fact planning to do Admiral",
  "Raeder, the German navy chief, realized that the fjords would be excellent naval bases",

  "from which to attack Britain\u2019s transatlantic supply lines When a British destroyer chased",
  "the German vessel Altmark into a Norwegian fjord and rescued the 300 British prisoners",
  "aboard, Hitler decided it was time to act. On 9 April, German troops landed at Oslo,",
  "Kristiansand, Stavanger, Bergen and Trondheim; although British and French troops",

  "because the Norwegians had been taken by surprise and their troops were not even mobi",

  "work well together.",
  "(d) Hitler attacks Holland, Belgium and France",
  "The attacks on Holland, Belgium and France were launched simultaneously on 10 May,",
  "and again Blitzkrieg methods brought swift victories. The Dutch, shaken by the bombing",
  ".",
  "of Rotterdam, which killed almost a thousand people, surrendered after only four days",
  "Belgium heldoutfor longer, but her surrenderat theend of May left the British and French",
  "troops in Belgium perilously exposed as German motorized divisions swept across north",

  "in evacuating over 338 000 troops - two-thirds of them British -from Dunkirk between",
  ".",
  "27 May and 4 June This was a remarkable achievement in the face of constant Luftwaffe",
  "attacks on the beaches. It would perhaps have been impossible if Hitler had not ordered",
  "the German advance towards Dunkirk to halt (24 May), probably because the marshy",
  "terrain and numerous canals were unsuitable for tanks.",
  "The events at Dunkirk were important: a third of a million Allied troops were rescued",
  "to fight again, and Churchill used it for propaganda purposes to boost British morale with",
  "the \u2018Dunkirk spirit\u2019. In fact it was a serious blow for the Allies: the troops at Dunkirk had",
  "lost all their arms and equipment, so that it became impossible for Britain to help France.",

  "6.4 WHAT PART WAS PLAYED BY ALLIED NAVAL FORCES?",
  "The previous section showed how the combination of sea and air power was the key to",
  "success in the Pacific war and how, after the initial shock at Pearl Harbor, the Americans",
  "were able to build up that superiority in both departments, which was to lead to the even",
  "\u00ac",
  "tual defeat of Japan. At the same time the British navy, as in the First World War, had a",
  "vital role to play: this included protecting merchant ships bringing food supplies, sinking",
  "German submarines and surface raiders, blockading Germany, and transporting and",
  "supplying Allied troops fighting in North Africa and later in Italy. At first success was",
  "mixed, mainly because the British failed to understand the importance of air support in",
  ".",
  "naval operations and had few aircraft carriers Thus they suffered defeats in Norway and",
  "Crete, where the Germans had strong air superiority. In addition the Germans had many",
  "naval bases in Norway, Denmark, France and Italy. In spite of this the British navy could",

  "This was the struggle against German U boats attempting to deprive Britain of food and",

  "being built In the first six months of that year the Allies lost over 4 million tons of",
  "merchant shipping and destroyed only 21 U-boats. Losses reached a peak of 108 ships in",

  "of sinkings began to fall, while the U-boat losses increased. By July 1943 the Alliescould",

  "at night",
  "The victory was just as important as Midway, El Alamein and Stalingrad: Britain could",
  "not have continued to sustain the losses of March 1943 and still remained in the war.",
  "6.5 WHAT CONTRIBUTION DID AIR POWER MAKE TO THE DEFEAT",
  "OF THE AXIS?",
  "(a) Achievements of Allied air power",
  "1 The first significant achievement was inthe Battle of Britain(1940),when the RAF",
  "beat off the Luftwaffe attacks, causing Hitler to abandon his invasion plans (see",
  "Section 6.1(f)).",
  "2 In conjunction with the British navy, aircraft played a varied role: the successful",
  "attackson the Italian fleet at Taranto and Cape Matapan, the sinking of the German",
  "battleship Tirpitz by heavy bombers in Norway (November 1943), the protection of",
  "convoys in the Atlantic, and anti-submarine operations. In fact, in May 1943",
  "Admiral Doenitz, the German navy chief, complained to Hitler that since the intro",
  "\u00ac",
  "duction of the new radar devices, more U-boats were being destroyed by aircraft",
  ".",
  "than by naval vessels",
  "3 The American air force together with the navy played a vital part in winning the",
  "Pacific war against the Japanese. Dive-bombers operating from aircraft carriers",
  "won the Battle of Midway Island in June 1942 (see Section 6.3(a)). Later, in the",
  "-",
  "\u2018island hopping\u2019 campaign, attacks by heavy bombers prepared the way for land",
  "\u00ac",
  "ings by marines, for example at the Mariana Islands (1944) and the Philippines",
  "(1945). American transport planes kept up the vital flow of supplies to the Allies",
  "during the campaign to recapture Burma.",
  "4 The RAF took part in specific campaigns which would have been hopeless without",
  "them: for example, during the war in the desert, operating from bases in Egypt and",

  "PARTI WAR ANDINTERNATIONALRELATIONSPalestine,they constantly bombed Rommel\u2019ssupply shipsin theMediterranean and",

  "\u00ac",
  "ing armies.(However,asimilaroperation at Arnhem in Holland in September 1944",
  ".",
  "was a failure )",
  "(b) Allied bombing of German and Japanese cities",
  ".",
  "The mostcontroversial action was the Allied bombing of German and Japanese cities The",
  "Germans had bombed London and other important British citiesand portsduring 1940and",
  "1941, but these raidsdwindled during the German attack on Russia, which required all the",
  ".",
  "Luftwaffe's strength The British and Americans retaliated with what they called a \u2018strate",
  "\u00ac",
  "gicairoffensive\u2019-this involved massive attackson military and industrial targets in order",
  "to hamper the German war effort. The Ruhr, Cologne, Hamburg and Berlin all suffered",
  "badly. Sometimes raids seem to have been carried out to undermine civilian morale, as",
  "when about 50 000 people were killed during a single night raid on Dresden (February",
  ".",
  "1945)",
  "Early in 1945 the Americans launched a series of devastating raids on Japan from",
  ".",
  "bases in the Mariana Islands In a single raid on Tokyo, in March, 80 000 people were",
  "killed and a quarter of the city wasdestroyed.There has been debate about how effective",
  ".",
  "the bombing was in hastening the Axis defeat It certainly caused enormouscivilian casu",
  "\u00ac",
  "alties and helped to destroy morale, but critics point out that heavy losses were also",
  "suffered by air-crews-over 158 000 Allied airmen were killed in Europe alone.",
  "Others argue that this type of bombing, which caused the deaths of so many innocent",
  "civilians (as opposed to bombings which targeted industrial areas, railways and bridges),",
  ".",
  "was morally wrong Estimates of German civilian deaths from Allied bombing vary",
  "between 600 000 and a million; German raids on Britain killed over 60 000 civilians. In",
  "2001 Swedish writer Sven Lindquist, in his book A History of Bombing, suggested that",
  "what he called \u2018the systematic attacks on German civilians in their homes\u2019 should be",
  "viewed as \u2018crimes under international humanitarian law for the protection of civilians\u2019.",
  "However, Robin Niellands (2001) defended the bombing, pointing out that this is what",
  "could be expected to happen during a total war-in the context of what the Germans had",
  "done in eastern Europe and the Japanese in their occupied territories, this was the neces",
  "\u00ac",
  "sary \u2018price of peace\u2019.",
  "This was by no means the end of the controversy: in 2002 a German historian, Jorg",
  "Friedrich, in his book Der Brand (The Fire), published an account of the horrific suffer",
  "\u00ac",
  "ing inflicted by Allied bombers on German citizens; an English translation came out in",
  ".",
  "2007 He blamed specifically Churchill and Arthur \u2018Bomber\u2019 Harris, the head of Bomber",
  "Command. Friedrich clearly believed that these bombing raids were war crimes. Many",
  ".",
  "British historians immediately condemned Friedrich\u2019s book Corelli Barnett called it \u2018a",
  ".",
  "historical travesty\u2019 designed to move the spotlight away from Nazi atrocities To mark the",
  "appearance of the English edition, York Membery, writing in History Today (January",
  "2007), sought the views of some leading British historians. Richard Overy suggested that",
  "while it was time for a proper assessment of the bombing strategy, Friedrich played down",
  ".",
  "the contribution of the Americansand felt that the general tone of his book was unhelpful",
  ".",
  "Overy went on to argue that the bombing was neither immoral nor strategically useless",
  "Adam Tooze,an experton the Nazieconomy, wrote: \u2018unfortunately,if you starta war with",
  "Britain as Germany deliberately did, then this is the kind of war you have to be prepared",
  "to fight\u2019. Bruce Kent, a peace campaigner and former secretary of CND, pointed out that",
  "the bombing raids probably were war crimes, but that the Nazis themselves were the first",
  "THESECONDWORLDWAR, 1939^t5 103to begin bombing innocent civilians in Guernica (during the Spanish Civil War),Warsaw",
  ".",
  "and Rotterdam",
  "As to the question of whether the bombing helped to shorten the war, it used to be",
  "thought that the campaign had little effect until the autumn of 1944. However, evidence",
  "from German archives shows that the RAF attack on the Ruhr in the spring of 1943 had",
  "an immediate effect on production. From July 1944, thanks to the increasing accuracy of",
  "the raids and the use of the new Mustang fighter escorts, which could outmanoeuvre all",
  "theGerman fighters,theeffectsof the bombings reacheddisasterproportions;syntheticoil",
  "production fell rapidly, causing acute fuel shortages. In October the vital Krupp arma",
  "\u00ac",
  "ments factories at Essen were put out of action permanently, and the war effort ground to",
  "a halt in 1945. By June 1945 the Japanese had been reduced to the same state.",
  "In the end, therefore, after much wasted effort early on, the Allied strategic air offen",
  "\u00ac",
  "sive was one of the decisive reasons for the Axis defeat: besides strangling fuel and arma",

  "6.7 WHY DID THE AXIS POWERS LOSE THE WAR?",
  "The reasons can be summarized briefly:",

  "(cid:127) the Axis powers taking on too much;",
  "(cid:127) the overwhelming impactof the combined resourcesof the USA,the USSR and the",
  "British Empire;",
  "(cid:127) tactical mistakes by the Axis powers.",
  "(a) Shortage of raw materials",
  "Both Italy and Japan had to import supplies, and even Germany was short of rubber,",
  "- .",
  "cotton, nickel and, after mid 1944, oil These shortages need not have been fatal, but",
  "success depended on a swift end to the war, which certainly seemed likely at first, thanks",

  "to the speed and efficiency of the German Blitzkrieg However, the survival of Britain in",

  "1940 was important because it kept the western front alive until the USA entered the war",
  "(b) The Allies soon learned from their early failures",
  "By 1942 they knew how to check Blitzkrieg attacks and appreciated the importance of air",
  "supportand aircraftcarriers.Consequently they built up an airand naval superiority which",
  "won the battlesof the Atlanticand the Pacificandslowly starved theirenemiesof supplies.",
  "(c) The Axis powers simply took on too much",
  "Hitler did not seem to understand that war against Britain would involve her empire as",
  "well,and that his troops were bound to be spread too thinly-on the Russian front,on both",

  "sides of the Mediterranean, and on the western coastline of France Japan made the same",
  "mistake: as military historian Liddell-Hart put it, \u2018they became stretched out far beyond",
  "their basic capacity for holding their gains. For Japan wasa small island state with limited",
  "industrial power.\u2019 In Germany\u2019s case, Mussolini was partly to blame: his incompetence",
  "was a constant drain on Hitler\u2019s resources.",
  "(d) The combined resources of the USA, the USSR and the British Empire",
  "These resources were so great that the longer the war lasted, the less chance the Axis had",
  "of victory. The Russians rapidly moved their industry east of the Ural Mountains and so",
  "THESECONDWORLDWAR, 1939^t5 109were able to continue production even though the Germans had occupied vast areas in the",

  "theextermination campat Majdanek nearLublin.They found hundredsof unburied corpses",
  "and seven gas chambers. Photographs taken at Majdanek were the first to reveal to the rest",
  "of the world the unspeakable horrors of these camps. It later emerged that over 1.5 million",

  "surrendered, some 5.7 million Jews were murdered, along with hundreds of thousands of",

  "war? These are some of the questions that historians have wrestled with as they try to",

  ".",
  "Earlier interpretations of the Holocaust can be divided into two main groups",
  "(cid:127)",
  "Intentionalists-historians who believed that responsibility for the Holocaust rests",
  "on Hitler, who had hoped and planned to exterminate the Jews ever since he came",
  ".",
  "to power",
  "(cid:127) Functionalists - historians who believed that the \u2018Final Solution\u2019 was in a sense",
  "forced on Hitler by the circumstances of the war.",
  "(cid:127) -",
  "There isalso asmall group of misguided writers with anti Semitic sympathies, who",
  ".",
  "try to play down the significance of the Holocaust They have variously argued that",
  "the numbers of dead have been greatly exaggerated; that Hitler himself was",
  "unaware of what was happening; and that other Nazis,such as Himmler, Heydrich",
  "and Goering, took the initiative; a few have even denied that the Holocaust ever",
  "took place at all. All these writers have now been largely discredited.",
  "(a) The intentionalists",
  "They argue that Hitler was personally responsiblefor the Holocaust. Rightfrom hisearly",
  "-",
  "days in Vienna he had been venomously anti Semitic; in his book Mein Kampf (My",
  "Struggle) he blamed the Jews for Germany\u2019s defeat in the First World War and for all",
  "her problems since. In his speech to the Reichstag in January 1939 Hitler declared: \u2018if",
  "international finance Jewry inside and outside Europe should succeed in plunging the",
  "nations once more into a world war,the result will be, not the bolshevization of the earth,",
  "and thereby the victory of Jewry, but the annihilation of the Jewish race in Europe\u2019. The",
  "intentionalists stress the continuity between his ideas in the early 1920s and the actual",
  "policies that were carried out in the 1940s. As Karl Dietrich Bracher puts it, although",
  "Hitler may not have had a master plan, he certainly knew what he wanted,and it included",
  "the annihilation of the Jews; the Final Solution \u2018was merely a matter of time and oppor",
  "\u00ac",
  "tunity\u2019. Critics of this theory question why it took until the end of 1941 - almost nine",

  "argue that it was sheer pressure of numbers that led the Nazi and SS leaders in Poland to",
  "press for the mass murder of Jews. Hitler\u2019s views were well known throughout Nazi",
  ".",
  "circles; he simply responded to the demands of the local Nazi leaders in Poland Hans",
  "Mommsen, one of the leading functionalists, believes that Hitler was \u2018a weak dictator\u2019 -",
  "in other words, more often than not, he followed the promptings of others rather than",
  "taking initiatives himself (see Section 14.6(d)) for more about the \u2018weak dictator\u2019 theory).",
  "As late as 2001 Mommsen was still suggesting that there was no clear evidence of any",
  "genocidal bent before 1939.",
  "According to Ian Kershaw in his biography of Hitler (published in 2000), \u2018Hitler\u2019s",
  "personalized form of rule invited radical initiatives from below and offered such initia",
  "\u00ac",
  "tives backing, so long as they were in line with his broadly defined goals.\u2019 The way to",
  "advancement in Hitler\u2019s Third Reich was to anticipate what the Fiihrer wanted, and then",
  "\u2018without waiting for directives, take initiatives to promote what were presumed to be",
  ".",
  "Hitler\u2019saims and wishes\u2019 The phrase used todescribe this process was \u2018working towards",
  "the Fiihrer\u2019. The intentionalists are not impressed with this interpretation because they",

  "would not even have been proposed if his subordinates had not been well aware of the",

  ".",
  "Some historians feel that the intentionalist v functionalist debate is now somewhat",
  "dated and that both approaches can be misleading. For example, Allan Bullock in Hitler",
  "and Stalin (1991), pointed out that the most obvious interpretation of the genocide was a",
  "combination of both approaches. Richard Overy in The Dictators (2004) claims that",
  "both approaches to the hunt for genocide divert attention from the central reality for",
  "all Jews after 1933: whether or not the later genocide was explicit or merely implicit",

  "What were Hitler's motives?Why was he so obsessively anti Jewish? It is clear from a",
  "secret memorandum which Hitler wrote in 1936, however crazy it may appear today, that",
  "he genuinely perceived the Jews as a threat to the German nation. He believed that the",
  "world, led by Germany, was on the verge of a historic racial and political struggle against",
  "the forces of communism, which he saw as a Jewish phenomenon. If Germany failed, the",

  "PARTI WAR ANDINTERNATIONALRELATIONS(c) The 'Final Solution' takes shape",
  "Alan Bullock argued that the best way to explain how the Holocaust came about is to",
  "combineelementsfrom both intentionalistsandfunctionalists.From the early 1920s Hitler",
  "had committed himself and the Nazi party to destroying the power of the Jewsand driving",
  "them out of Germany, but exactly how this was to be done was left vague. \u2018It is very",
  "likely\u2019, writes Bullock, \u2018that among the fantasies in which he indulged privately ... was",
  "the evil dream of a final settlement in which every man, woman and child of Jewish race",
  "would be butchered. ... But how, when, even whether, the dream could ever be realized",
  ".",
  "remained uncertain \u2019",
  "It is important to remember that Hitler was a clever politician who paid a lot of atten",
  ". \u00ac",
  "tion to publicopinion During theearly yearsof hisChancellorship,he was wellaware that",
  "the so-called \u2018Jewish question\u2019 was not a main concern of most German people.",
  "Consequently he would go no further than the Nuremberg Laws (1935) (see Section",
  "14.4(b), Point 11), and even they were introduced to satisfy the Nazi hardliners. Hitler",
  "allowed Kristallnacht togoahead in November 1938for thesamereason,and to test popu",
  "\u00ac",
  "lar feeling. When public opinion reacted unfavourably, he called an end to violence and",
  "concentrated on excluding Jews as far as possible from German life. They were encour",
  "\u00ac",
  "aged to emigrate and their property and assets were seized. Before the outbreak of war,",
  "well over half a million Jews had left the country; plans were being discussed to forcibly",
  "remove as many Jews as possible to Madagascar.",
  "It was the outbreak of war, and in particular the invasion of Russia (June 1941), that",
  "radically changed the situation. According to Richard Overy, this was seen not as an",
  "accidental or unplanned opportunity for a more vigorous anti-Jewish policy, but as \u2018an",
  "extension of an anti-Semitic Cold War that Germany had been engaged in since at least",
  "her defeat in 1918\u2019.The occupation of the whole of Poland and large areas of the USSR",
  "meant that many more Jews came under German control, but at the same time the",
  "conditions of war meant that it was almost impossible for them to emigrate. In Poland,",
  "around two and a half million Jews were forcibly moved from their homes and herded",
  "into overcrowded ghettos in cities such as Warsaw, Lublin and Lodi In 1939, for",
  "example, 375 000 Jews lived in Warsaw; after they captured the city, the Germans built",
  "a wall round the Jewish districts. Later, Jews from other parts of Poland were moved",
  "into Warsaw, until by July 1941, there were about 445 000 Jews crammed into this",

  "Map6.7 TheHolocaustAlan Bullock provided this chilling description of what happened when each new",
  "batch of Jews arrived at one of the death camps:",
  "They were put through the same ghastly routine. White-coated doctors- with a",
  "gesture of the hand - selected those fit enough to be worked to death. The rest",
  "were required to give up all their clothing and possessions and then in a terrified",
  "column of naked men and women, carrying their children or holding their hands",
  "-",
  "and trying to comfort them, were herded into the gas chambers. When the",
  "screaming dieddown and the doors were opened,they were still standing upright,",
  "so tightly packed that they could not fall. But where there had been human",
  "beings, there were now corpses, which were removed to the ovens for burning.",
  "This was the daily spectacle which Hitler took good care never to see and which",
  "haunts the imagination of anyone who has studied the evidence.",
  "What sort of people could carry out such crimes against humanity? Historian Daniel",
  "Goldhagen, in his book Hitler's Willing Executioners, published in 1997, suggests that",
  "the German people were uniquely anti-Semitic and were collectively responsible for the",
  "many atrocities committed during the Third Reich. These included not just the \u2018Final",
  "Solution\u2019 of the \u2018Jewish problem\u2019, but also the euthanasia programme in which some",
  "70 000 people deemed to be mentally handicapped or mentally ill were killed, the cruel",
  "treatment of the Polish people during the occupation, and the appalling way in which",
  ".",
  "Russian prisoners of war and the civilian populations were treated Michael Burleigh",
  "-",
  "(2010) goes along with Goldhagen, suggesting that there was a sort of inherent anti",
  "Semitism in the German people which the Nazis had only to tap into; there was no need",
  "to stir it up.",
  "While Goldhagen\u2019s theory perhaps goes too far, there is no doubt that large numbersof",
  ".",
  "ordinary Germans were willing to go along with Hitler and the other leading Nazis",
  "Perhaps they were convinced by the argumentsof men like Himmler, who told a group of",
  "SS commanders: \u2018We had the moral right, we had the duty to destroy this people which",
  ".",
  "wanted to destroy us\u2019 The SS, originally Hitler\u2019s bodyguard regiments, along with the",
  "security police,camp commandants and guards,and local gauleiters (governors), were all",
  "deeply implicated,and so was much of the Wehrmacht (the German army), which became",
  "increasingly ruthless and barbaric as the war in the east progressed. Leaders of big busi",
  "\u00ac",
  "ness and factory owners were willing to take advantage of the cheap labour provided by",
  "the camp inmates; others were grateful to get their hands on confiscated Jewish property",
  "and other assets; medical experts were prepared to use Jews in experiments which caused",
  "their deaths. At all levels of German society there were people who happily took the",
  "chance to profit from the fate of the helpless Jews.",
  "But such behaviour was not confined to the Germans: many Polish and Soviet citizens",
  ".",
  "willingly collaborated in the genocide Only three days after the invasion of the USSR",
  "began, 1500 Jews were savagely murdered in Lithuania by local militias, and soon thou",
  "\u00ac",
  "sands more had been killed by non-Germans in Belorussia and Ukraine. Ion Antonescu,",
  "the rulerof Romaniafrom 1941 until 1944, was not bullied intodeporting Romanian Jews:",
  "Romania was never occupied by Germans, and the initiative was taken by the Romanians",
  "themselves. However, without Hitler and the Nazis to provide the authority, the legiti",
  ". \u00ac",
  "macy, the backing and the drive, none of this would have been possible Romania, though",
  "not actually occupied, was firmly within Germany\u2019s orbit.",
  "On the other hand it must be remembered that many Germanscourageously risked their",
  "lives to help Jews, giving them shelter and organizing escape routes. But it was a very",
  "dangerous business - such people themselves often ended up in concentration camps.",
