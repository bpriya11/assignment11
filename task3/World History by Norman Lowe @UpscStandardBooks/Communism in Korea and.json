  "developed over the question of whether or not North Korea possessed nuclear weapons",
  "The Americans suspected that they did, but the North Koreans claimed that their nuclear-",
  "reactor plants were to provide electricity. The behaviour of both sides, especially North",
  "Korea, was inconsistent, and the dispute was still ongoing in 2012. The problem arose",
  "from the lack of progress with the KEDO project agreed in 1994. Work was not even",
  "started on the promised light-water reactors; the Americans accused Kim of not complet",
  "\u00ac",

  "protested that work on the new light water reactors must start before they shut down their",

  "of making any, and said they were ready to allow the USA to send its own inspectors to",
  "verify the claims. However, in April 2003 a spokesman for the North Korean foreign",
  "ministry claimed that they already had nuclear weapons and would shortly have enough",
  "plutonium for eight more nuclear warheads. This gave rise to widespread international",
  "speculation and discussion over whether or not the North Koreans really did have nuclear",
  "weapons; the majority view seemed to be that they did not, and that their tactics were",

  "Iraq, Kim wanted to make Bush think twice before he took on North Korea as well",
  "Although some members of Bush\u2019s administration made hostile remarks about Kim",
  "Jong-il, the president himself was anxious to calm things, especially as American forces",
  "were becoming embroiled in an increasingly difficult situation in Iraq. In August 2003 the",
  "Americans softened their approach in talks with the North Koreans: instead of demanding",
  "that the nuclear programme be scrapped completely before USaid would beresumed,they",
  "now signified that a step-by-step approach to dismantling nuclear facilities would be",

  "acceptable and would be matched by \u2018corresponding steps\u2019 from the American side Later",
  "Bush announced that the USA would continue to finance the KEDO project and was",
  "prepared tooffer North Koreaassurancesof securityin exchangefora verifiablescrapping",
  "of its nuclear weapons programme. North Korea replied that it was ready to consider",

  "it now had nuclear weapons,and in October 2006 itclaimed to have successfully exploded",
  "a nuclear device underground, without any radiation leak.",
  "In 2009 relations between North and South Korea became strained after the north",
