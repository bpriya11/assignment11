  "2 The Battle of the Somme was a series of attacks, mainly by the British, beginning",

  "four months. At the end of it all, the Allies had made only limited advances vary",
  "\u00ac",

  "power to be reckoned with.",
  "Losses on both sides, killed or wounded, were appalling (Germans 650 000; British",

  "418 000; French 194 000) The Allied generals, especially Haig, came under severe criti",

  "cism for persisting with suicidal frontal attacks In spite of the failures and the appalling",
  "casualties, both British and French generals remained convinced that mass infantry",

  "showed any sign of producing alternative tactics,and tensof thousandsof lives weresacri",
  "\u00ac",

  "most serious criticism for the majority of historians, he became the epitome of Allied",
  "incompetence and lack of imagination. One historian, W. J. Laffin, went so far as to call",
  "his book about the war British Butchersand Bunglers of WorldWar l (1988),and for him",
  "the chief \u2018donkey\u2019 was Haig. J. P. Harris, in Douglas Haig and the First World War",
  "(2008), is rather more balanced. He argues that Haig certainly found it difficult to cope",
  "with the unprecedented situation that he found himself in on the western front and he",
  "misjudged the strength of the German forces. He was slow to see beyond the tactic of the",
  "\u2018big push\u2019 and must therefore bear much of the responsibility for the massive casualties.",
  "However, he did eventually show himself to be receptive to new techniquesand strategies",
  "and played a vital role in the 1918 campaign which brought the final collapse of German",

  "forces",
  "The horrors of the Somme also contributed to the fall of the British prime minister,",
  "Asquith, who resigned in 1916 after criticism of British tactics mounted. And yet the",
  "events of 1916 did contribute towards the eventual Allied victory; Hindenburg himself",

  "In June 1916 the Russians under Brusilov attacked the Austrians, in response to a plea",
  "from Britain and France for some action to divert German attention away from Verdun.",

  "2.4 THE WAR AT SEA",
  "The general public in Germany and Britain expected a series of naval battles between the",
  "rival Dreadnought fleets, something like the Battle of Trafalgar (1805),in which Nelson\u2019s",
  "British fleet had defeated the combined French and Spanish fleets. But both sides were",

  "27 British.",
  "(a) The Allies aimed to use their navies in three ways",
  "(cid:127) to blockade the Central Powers, preventing goods from entering or leaving, slowly",
  "starving them out;",
  "(cid:127) to keep trade routes open between Britain, her empire and the rest of the world, so",
  "that the Allies themselves would not starve;",
  "(cid:127) to transport British troops to the continent and keep them supplied via the Channel",
  ".",
  "ports",
  "The British were successful in carrying out these aims; they went into action against",
  "German units stationed abroad, and at the Battle of the Falkland Islands,destroyed one of",
  ".",
  "the main German squadrons By the end of 1914 nearly all German armed surface ships",
  "had been destroyed, apart from their main fleet (which did not venture out of the",
  ".",
  "Heligoland Bight) and the squadron blockading the Baltic to cut off supplies to Russia In",
  "1915 the British navy was involved in the Gallipoli Campaign (see Section 2.2(b)).",
  "(b) The Allied blockade caused problems",
  "Britain was trying to prevent the Germansfrom using the neutral Scandinavian and Dutch",
  "ports to break the blockade; this involved stopping and searching all neutral ships and",
  "THEFIRSTWORLDWAR ANDITS AFTERMATH 25.",
  "confiscating any goods suspected of being intended for enemy hands The USA objected",
  ".",
  "strongly to this, since they were anxious to continue trading with both sides",
  "(c) The Germans retaliated with mines and submarine attacks",
  "These tactics seemed to be the only alternative left to the Germans, since their surface",
  "vessels hadeither been destroyed or were blockaded in port. At first they respected neutral",
  "-",
  "shipping and passenger liners, but it was soon clear that the German submarine (U boat)",
  "blockade was not effective. This was partly because they had insufficient U-boats and",
  "partly because there were problems of identification: the British tried to fool the Germans",
  "by flying neutral flags and by using passenger liners to transport arms and ammunition. In",
  "April 1915 the British liner Lusitania was sunk by a torpedo attack. In fact the Lusitania",
  "was armed and carrying vast quantities of weapons and ammunition, as the Germans",
  "knew; hence their claim that the sinking was not just an act of barbarism against defence",

  "This had important consequences: out of almost two thousand dead, 128 were",

  "Admiral von Scheer tried to lure part of the British fleet out from its base so that that",
  "section could be destroyed by the numerically superior Germans. However, more British",
  "ships came out than he had anticipated, and after the two fleets had shelled each other on",
  "and off for several hours, the Germans decided to retire to base, firing torpedoes as they",
  "went. On balance, the Germans could claim that they had won the battle since they lost",
  "only 11 ships to Britain\u2019s 14. The real importance of the battle lay in the fact that the",
  "Germans had failed to destroy British sea power: the German High Seas Fleet stayed in",
  "Kiel for the rest of the war, leaving Britain\u2019s control of the surface complete. In despera",

  "(e) 'Unrestricted' submarine warfare (began January 1917)",
  "As the Germans had been concentrating on the production of U-boats since the Battle of",
  "Jutland, this campaign was extremely effective. They attempted to sink all enemy and",
  "neutral merchant ships in the Atlantic;although they knew that this was likely to bring the",
  "USA into the war, they hoped that Britain and France would be starved into surrender",
  "before the Americans could make any vital contribution. They almost did it: the peak of",
  "German successcamein April 1917, when 430 ships were lost;Britain wasdown to about",
  "six weeks\u2019 corn supply, and although the USA came into the war in April, it was bound",
  "to be several months before their help became effective. However, the situation was saved",

  "while negotiations went on, but eventually an armistice was signed on 11 November",
  "(c) Why did the war last so long?",
  "When the war started the majority of people on both sides believed that it would be over",
  "by Christmas. However, Britain\u2019s Secretary for War, Lord Kitchener, himself a successful",
  "general, told the cabinet,much to itscollectivedismay,that it would last nearer three years",
  "than three months. Though he did not live to see the end of the war (he was drowned in",
  "1916 on his way to Russia, when his ship struck a mine and sank), he was one of the few",
  "who had judged the situation correctly. There are several reasons why the conflict lasted",
  "so long. The two sides were fairly evenly balanced, and although the main theatre of war",
  "was in Europe, it quickly became a global conflict. Other countries that had not been in",
  "the original alliance systems, decided to join in, some because they saw it as a chance to",
  "gain new territory,and others waited to see which side looked the more likely to win,and",
  "then joined that side. For example, Italy (May 1915), Romania (August 1916), the USA",
  "(April 1917) and Japan joined the Allied side, while Turkey (November 1914) and",
  "Bulgaria (October 1915) joined the Central Powers. To complicate matters further, troops",
  "from the British Empire-from India, Australia, New Zealand, Canada and South Africa",
  "-",
  "all played their part in the fighting, which eventually spread into the eastern",
  ".",
  "Mediterranean, Asia and Africa",
  "The main countries involved in the war had very strongly held war aims which they",
  "were absolutely determined to achieve. The Germans,anxious to protect themselves from",
  "becoming \u2018encircled\u2019, aimed to take territory from Poland in the east and Belgium in the",
  "west to act as buffer zones against Russia and France. The French were obsessed with",

  "likeGermany Austria-Hungary wasdesperate to preserveitsempireagainst theambitions",

  ".",
  "almost impossible to reach an acceptable negotiated solution",
  "Once stalemate had been reachedon the western front with troops bogged down in lines",
  "of trenches, the Allies were faced with difficult problems: the weapons available to the",
  "Central Powers as they defended their trenches were more deadly than those available to",
  "the attackers. German troops, using fixed machine-guns in trenches protected by barbed",
  "wire, had a huge advantage over the attackers, who relied too much on preceding artillery",
  "bombardments (see Section 2.2 for more about the problems of trench warfare). Another",
  "remarkable factor prolonging the war was the way in which propaganda helped to moti",
  "\u00ac",
  "vate and encourage the general public as well as the military on both sides. Morale was",
  "boosted and support for the war sustained by newspapers, posters, films and advertise",
  "\u00ac",

  "continued The defeat of Russia encouraged the German generals to continue the struggle",
  "and launch what turned out to be a last desperate attempt to break through on the western",
  "front in spring 1918, before too many American troops arrived on the scene. A combina",
  "\u00ac",
  "tion of all thesefactors meant that there would have to be afight to the finish untilone side",
  "or the other was either overrun and occupied by the enemy, or was so completely",
  "exhausted that it could not carry on fighting.",
  "(d) Why did the Central Powers lose the war?",
  "The reasons can be briefly summarized:",
  "1 Once the Schlieffen Plan had failed, removing all hope of a quick German victory,",
  ".",
  "it was bound to be a strain for them, facing war ontwo fronts",
  "2 Allied sea power wasdecisive,enforcing thedeadly blockade,which causeddesper",

  "same time making sure that the Allied armies were fully supplied.",
  "3 TheGerman submarinecampaign failed in theface of convoys protected by British,",
  "American and Japanese destroyers; the campaign itself was a mistake because it",
  "brought the USA into the war.",
  "4 The entry of the USA brought vast new resources to the Alliesand made up for the",
  "departure of Russia from the war. It meant that the Allied powers were able to",
  "produce more war materials than the enemy, and in the end this proved decisive.",
  "5 Allied political leaders at the critical time-Lloyd George and Clemenceau - were",
  "probably more competent than those of the Central Powers. The unity of command",
  "under Foch probably helped, while Haig learned lessons, from the 1917 experi",
  "\u00ac.",
  "ences, which proved to be crucial to the allied victory in the final stages of the war",
  "In fact some historians believe that the criticisms levelled at Haig are unfair. John",
  "Terraine was one of the first to present a defence of Haig, in his book Douglas",
  "Haig: The Educated Soldier (1963). Recently Gary Sheffield has gone further: in",
  "The Chief: Douglas Haig andthe British Army (2011) he argues that,given the fact",
  "that the British had no experience of trench warfare, and that they were the junior",

  "the Germans, whose losses were also heavy Finally Haig\u2019s generalship was a",
  "crucial component of the Allied victory in 1918. He had learned lessons about the",
  "effective use of tanks, and the avoidance of salients by using small groups of",
  "infantry attacking at different points along the trench line; his idea of transporting",
  "infantry in buses to accompany the cavalry was very effective. Eventually, too,",
  "there was a great improvement in the coordination between infantry, artillery and",

  "been the greatest military figure Britain has ever produced, but he was one of the",
  "most significant-and one of the most successful.\u2019",
  "6 The continuous strain of heavy losses told on the Germans - they lost their best",
  "troops in the 1918 offensive and the new troops were young and inexperienced. At",
  "the same time theforces available to the Allies were increasing as more Americans",
  "arrived, bringing the total of American troops to around two million. From July",
  "1918 onwards the Germans were forced into their final retreat. An epidemic of",
  "deadly Spanish flu added to their difficulties and morale was low as they retreated.",

  "(e) Effects of the war",
  "The impact of the war was extraordinarily wide-ranging, which was not surprising given",
  "that it was the first \u2018total war\u2019 in history. This means that it involved not just armies and",
  "navies but entire populations, and it was the first big conflict between modern, industrial",
  "\u00ac",
  "ized nations. New methods of warfare and new weapons were introduced - tanks,",
  "submarines, bombers, machine-guns, heavy artillery and mustard gas. With so many men",
  "away in the armed forces, women had to take their places in factories and in other jobs",
  "which had previously been carried out by men. In the Central Powers and in Russia, the",

  "Europe\u2019s prestige in the eyes of the rest of the world The fact that the region which had",

  "appalling carnage and destruction v a sign of the beginning of the end of European",
  "domination of the rest of the world. e effects on individual countries were sometimes",
  "little short of traumatic: the empires which had dominated central and eastern Europe for",
  "over two hundred years disappeared almost overnight.",
  "1 The most striking effect of the war was the appalling death toll among the armed",
  "forces. Almost 2 million Germans died, 1.7 million Russians, 1.5 million French,",

  "over a million Austro Hungarians and about one million from Britain and her",

  "158 000, the USA 116 000, Bulgaria 49 000 and Belgium 41 000 And this did not",

  "example, lost around 20 per cent of men of military age. However, military histo",
  "\u00ac",
  "rian Dan Todman, in The First WorldWar: Myth and Memory (2005), argues that",
  "as time has passed, the public perception of the war has changed. He produces",
  "evidence suggesting that the Tost generation\u2019 interpretation issomething of a myth.",
  "Certainly casualties were severe but were not the wholesale destruction of a gener",
  "\u00ac",
  "ation that was claimed. According to Todman, overall, just 12 per cent of fighting",
  "men died. Although some 20 000 British soldiers were killed on the first day of the",
  "Battle of the Somme, this was not typical of the war as a whole. In the circum",
  "\u00ac",
  "stances, Todman insists, Haig had no alternative - his was the only rational strat",
  "\u00ac",

  "difficult to putaside the long-held perceptionof the warasa \u2018futile mud-and blood",

  "(February-March) overthrew the tsar, Nicholas II, and the second",
  "(October-November) brought Lenin and the Bolsheviks (Communists) to power",
  "(see Sections 16.2-3).",

  "6 On theother hand,somecountriesoutside Europe,particularly Japan,Chinaand the",
  "USA, took advantage of Europe\u2019s preoccupation with the war to expand their trade",
  "at Europe\u2019s expense. For example, the USA\u2019s share of world trade grew from 10",
  "per cent in 1914 to over 20 per cent by 1919. Since they were unable to obtain",
  "European imports during the war,Japan and China began their own programmes of",
