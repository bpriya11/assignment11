  "424 PART III COMMUNISM-RISEANDDECLINE19.3 MAO ZEDONG AND THE CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY",
  "(a) The early years",
  "The party had been officially founded in 1921; at first it consisted mostly of intellectuals",
  "and had very little military strength, which explains why it was willing to work with the",
  "KMT. Mao Zedong, who was present at the founding meeting, was born in Hunan",
  "-",
  "province (1893) in south east China, the son of a prosperous peasant farmer. After spend",
  "\u00ac",
  "ing some time working on the land, Mao trained as a teacher,and then moved northwards",
  "to Beijing where he worked asa library assistantat the university,acentre of Marxist stud",
  "\u00ac",
  "ies. Later he moved back to Hunan and built up a reputation as a skilful trade union and",
  "peasant association organizer. After the communist breach with the KMT, Mao was",
  "responsible for changing the Party\u2019s strategy: they would concentrate on winning mass",
  "support among the peasants rather than trying to capture industrial towns, where several",
  "communist insurrections had already failed because of the strength of the KMT. In 1931",
  "Mao waselected chairman of theCentralExecutive Committee of the Party,and from then",
  ".",
  "on, he gradually consolidated his position as the real leader of Chinese communism The",
  "Chinese Soviet Republic was proclaimed at Juichin in 1931,and on 7 November 1931 the",
  "first All-China Congress of Soviets was held there. It was attended by delegates from 15",
  ".",
  "soviet areas",
  "Mao and his supporters spent most of their energies on survival as Chiang carried out",
  "five \u2018extermination campaigns\u2019 against them between 1930 and 1934. They took to the",
  "mountains between Hunan and Kiangsi provincesand concentrated on building up the Red",
  "Army. However, early in 1934 Mao\u2019s base area was surrounded by KMT armies poised",
  "for the final destruction of Chinese communism. Mao decided that the only chance of",
  "survival was to break through Chiang\u2019s lines and set up another power base somewhere",
  "else. In October 1934 the breakthrough was achieved and almost 100 000 communists set",
  "out on the remarkable Long March, which was to become part of Chinese legend. They",
  "covered about 6000 miles in 368days (see Map 19.1) and, in the wordsof American jour",
  "\u00ac",
  "nalist Edgar Snow:",
  "crossed 18 mountain ranges,5 of which were snow-capped,and 24 rivers.They passed",
  "through 12 different provinces, occupied 62 cities, and broke through enveloping",
  "armies of 10 different provincial warlords, besides defeating, eluding, or out-manoeu",

  "Eventually the 20 000 survivors found refuge at Yenan in Shensi province: this was the",
  "last surviving communist base in China and was controlled by the guerrilla leader Kao",
  "Kang. The Shensi communists, not entirely willingly, accepted Mao as leader, and a new",
  ".",
  "base and a soviet were organized Mao was able to control the provinces of Shensi and",
  "Kansu. However, according to writers Jung Chang and Jon Halliday in their book Mao:",
  "The Unknown Story, published in 2005, the march was vastly exaggerated and was in fact",
  "nothing like as heroic as legend claimed. They even suggested that Mao\u2019s \u2018breakout\u2019 in",
  "October 1934 was actually permitted by Chiang Kai-shek because he preferred the",
  "communists to be in the north where he could box them in while he extended the KMT",
  "control over the south-west.This interpretation was welcomed by Mao\u2019scritics, but histo",
  "\u00ac",
  "rians generally gave a more balanced judgement: while agreeing that there had been some",
  "exaggeration in accounts of the march in order to show Mao and the communists in the",
  "best possible light, they rejected the Jung Chang/Halliday interpretation as \u2018more fantasy",
  "than fact\u2019. During the ten years following the Long March the communists continued to",

  "the communists, so that Stalin refused to take part in any meeting at which Chiang was",
  "present. As an encouragement, in January 1943 the USA, Britain and several other states",
  "renounced their territorial rights and concessions in China (though Britain insisted on",
