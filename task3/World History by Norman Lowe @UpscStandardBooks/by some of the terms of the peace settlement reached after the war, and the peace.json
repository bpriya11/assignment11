  "The Germans had little choice but to sign the treaty, though they objected strongly The",
  "signing ceremony took place in the Hall of Mirrors at Versailles, where the German",
  "Empire had been proclaimed less than 50 years earlier.",
  "(b) Why did the Germans object, and how far were their objections",
  "justified?",
  "1 It was a dictated peace",
  "The Germans were not allowed into the discussions at Versailles; they were simply",
  "presented with the terms and told to sign. Although they were allowed to criticize the",
  "34 PART I WAR ANDINTERNATIONAL RELATIONS.",
  "treaty in writing, all their criticisms were ignored except one (see Point 3 below) Some",
  "historians feel that the Germans were justified in objecting, and that it would have been",
  ". -",
  "reasonable to allow them to take part in the discussions This might have led to a toning",
  ".",
  "down of some of the harsher terms It would certainly have deprived the Germans of the",
  "argument much used by Hitler, that because the peace was a \u2018Diktat\u2019, it should not be",
  "morally binding.On the other hand, it is possible to argue that the Germanscould scarcely",
  "have expected any better treatment after the harsh way they had dealt with the Russians at",
  "Brest-Litovsk-also a \u2018Diktat\u2019 (see Section 16.3(b)).",
  "2 Many provisions were not based on the 14 Points",
  "TheGermansclaimed that they had been promised terms basedon Wilson\u2019s 14Points,and",
  "that many of the provisions were not based on the 14 Points,and were therefore a swin",
  "\u00ac",
  "dle. This is probably not a valid objection: the 14 Points had never been accepted as offi",
  "\u00ac",
  "cial by any of the states involved, and the Germans themselves had ignored them in",
  "January 1918, when therestillseemedachance of outrightGerman victory.By November,",
  "German tactics (Brest-Litovsk, the destruction of mines, factories and public buildings",
  "during their retreat through France and Belgium) had hardened the Allied attitude and led",
  ".",
  "Wilson to add two further points Germany should pay for the damage to civilian popula",
  "' \u00ac",
  "tion and property,and should be reduced to \u2018virtual impotence\u2019; in other words,Germany",
  "should be disarmed. The Germans were aware of this when they accepted the armistice,",
  ".",
  "and, in fact, most of the terms did comply with the 14 Points and the additions",
  "There were also objections on specific points:",
  "3 Loss of territory in Europe",
  "This included Alsace-Lorraine and especially West Prussia, which gave Poland access to",
  ". .",
  "the sea However, both were mentioned in the 14 Points Originally Upper Silesia, an",
  "industrial region with a mixed population of Poles and Germans, was to be given to",
  "Poland, but this was the one concession made to the German written objections: after a",
  "vote among the population,Germany was allowed to keep about two-thirds of the area. In",
  "fact most of the German losses could be justified on grounds of nationality (Map 2.5).",
  "Where the Germans did have genuine cause for protest was on the question of national",
  "self-determination. Rightfrom the startof the peaceconference the Allies had emphasized",
  "that all nationalities should have the right to choose which country they wanted to belong",
  "to. This principle had been applied in the case of non-Germans; but the settlement left",
  "around a million Germans under Polish rule, and almost three million in the Sudetenland",
  "controlled by the new state of Czechoslovakia. In addition, Austria was a completely",
  "German state with a population of some seven million. All these Germans wanted to",
  "become part of Germany, but the unification of Germany and Austria was specifically",
  "forbidden in the agreement, probably because that would have made Germany larger and",
  "more powerful even than in 1914.",
  "4 Loss of Germany\u2019s African colonies",
  "The Germans probably had good groundsfor objection to the lossof their Africancolonies,",
  "which was hardly an \u2018impartial adjustment\u2019. The mandate system allowed Britain to take",
  "over German East Africa (Tanganyika) and parts of Togoland and the Cameroons, France",
  "to take most of Togoland and the Cameroons, and South Africa to acquire German South",
  "West Africa (now known as Namibia); but this was really a device by which the Allies",
  ".",
  "seized the colonies without actually admitting that they were being annexed (Map 2.6)",
  "5 The disarmament clauses were deeply resented",
  "The Germansclaimed that 100000 troops were notenough to keep law andorder ata time",
  "of political unrest. Perhaps the German objection was justified to some extent, though the",

  "In conclusion, it has to be said that this collection of peace treaties was not a conspicuous",
  ".",
  "success It had the unfortunate effect of dividing Europe into the states which wanted to",
  "revise the settlement (Germany being the main one), and those which wanted to preserve",
  ".",
  "it On the whole the latter turned out to be only lukewarm in their support. The USAfailed",
  "to ratify the settlement (see Section 4.5) and never joined the League of Nations. This in",
  "-",
  "turn left France completely disenchanted with the whole thing because the Anglo",
  ".",
  "American guarantee of her frontiersgiven in the agreement could not now apply Italy felt",
  "cheated because she had not received all the territory promised her in 1915, and Russia",
  ".",
  "was ignored, because the powersdid not want to negotiate with its Bolshevik government",
  "Germany, on the other hand, was only temporarily weakened and was soon strong",
  "enough to challenge certain of the terms. In fact it is possible to argue that Germany was",
  ".",
  "weakened less than her enemies Much of France, Poland and the Balkans had been",
  "ravaged by occupying troops, whereasGerman territory was virtually untouched. Afterall,",
  "no enemy troops had set foot on German soil and not surprisingly it was soon widely",
  ".",
  "accepted in Germany that their armies had not been defeated Returning German soldiers",
  "were welcomed back as heroes, fresh and undefeated from the battlefield. German indus",
  "\u00ac",
  "try was able to switch back to peacetime production remarkably quickly,and by 1921 was",
  "producing three times as much steel as France.",
  "All this tended to sabotage the settlement from the beginning, and it became increas",
  "\u00ac",
  "ingly difficult to apply the terms fully. Clearly, since Germany was still the strongest",
  "power in Europe economically, the greatfailing of the peace settlement was that it left the",
  "Germans with a sense of resentment and grievance, but did not leave them too weak to",
  "retaliate and seek revenge. These weaknesses were widely recognized at the time, even",
  "among allied delegates at the conference. Harold Nicolson, a British diplomat at the",
  "conference, wrote: \u2018If I were the Germans, I shouldn\u2019t sign for a moment.\u2019 John Maynard",
  "Keynes,a senior British delegate and economic adviser, was so disillusioned with the way",
  "things weregoing that heresigned in protestand came home. But it iseasy tocriticizeafter",
  "theevent;GilbertWhite,oneof the Americandelegates,put it well when he remarked that,",
  "given the intricacy of the problems involved, \u2018it is not surprising that they made a bad",
  "peace: what is surprising is that they managed to make peace at all\u2019. With the availability",
  "of new sources, many historians find themselves in sympathy with this assessment, and",
  "argue that the settlement can now be seen \u2018as a workable compromise\u2019, and perhaps the",
  "best that could have been achieved under difficult circumstances. True, there were some",
  "mistakes, but the peacemakers cannot be blamed for Hitler\u2019s rise to power, and certainly",
  ". . . .",
  "not for the Second World War For example P M H Bell, in his book Origins of the",
  "Second World War in Europe (2007), argues that in the early 1920s, Europe, including",
  "Germany, was beginning to recover well from the after-effectsof the war.The tragedy was",
  "that \u2018the outline of a successful European recovery was cut off in its prime by the great",
  "depression and its dreadful consequence, the advent of Hitler\u2019.",
