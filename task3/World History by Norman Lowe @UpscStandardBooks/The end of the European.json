  "Over the next 30 years, remarkable changes took place By 1975 most of these colonial",

  "were often complex; in India there were bitter religious differences to resolve In some",
  "areas-Algeria, Kenya, Tanganyika, Uganda and Rhodesia-large numbers of whites had",
  "settled,and they were relentlessly hostile to independence, which would place them under",
  "black rule. Britain was prepared to grant independence when it was felt that individual",

  "PARTY DECOLONIZATION ANDAFTER24.1 WHY DID THE EUROPEAN POWERS GIVE UP THEIR EMPIRES?",
  "During the 1990smore documentsdealing with decolonization becameavailable,enabling",
  "historians to investigate more deeply the motives of the European powers in giving up",
  "theircoloniesand the different ways in which they carriedout their withdrawals.The main",
  "debate that has developed is about the extent to which decolonization was caused by local",
  "nationalist movements, and how far it was brought about by outside political and",
  ".",
  "economic considerations Robert Holland,a leading exponent of what has become known",
  "as the\u2018metropolitanthesis\u2019,believes thatoutsideforces-metropolitanforces-were more",
  ".",
  "important He writes:",
  "The great colonial powers divested themselves of their subordinate possessions, not",
  "because internal pressures within their colonies left them with no other choice, but in",
  "the wake of a revisionist process whereby imperial roles came to be seen as incongru-",
  "ent with more \u2018modern\u2019 goals in the fields of foreign and economic policy.",
  "Other historians feel that more credit must be given to the strength of local nationalist",
  "movements,and they acknowledge that in some casestheimperial power wasquitesimply",
  "expelled by sheer force. For example, would the British have left East and Central Africa",
  "for purely \u2018metropolitan\u2019 reasons if there had been no nationalist movements in these",
  "areas?Of course thereis no simple answer.Whatcan be said with certainty is thatall these",
  "factors were present in varying degrees in all colonial territories.",
  "(a) Nationalist movements",
  "These had been in existence in many of Europe\u2019s overseas colonies, especially those in",
  "Asia, for many years before the Second World War. Nationalists were people who had a",
  "naturaldesire to get rid of their foreign rulersso that they could have a government run by",
  ".",
  "people of their own nationality Although the European powers claimed to have brought",
  "the benefits of western civilization to their colonies, there was a general feeling among",
  "colonial peoples that they were being exploited by the Europeans, who took most of the",
  ".",
  "profits from their partnership They claimed that the development and prosperity of the",
  "colonies were being held back in the interests of Europe, and that most of the colonial",
  "peoples continued to live in poverty. In India, the Indian National Congress Party had",
  "been agitating against British rule since 1885, while in south-east Asia, Vietnamese",
  "nationalists began to campaign against French rule during the 1920s. However, national",
  "\u00ac",
  "ism was not so strong in other areas,and progress towards independence would have been",
  "much slower without the boost provided by the Second World War. There is no doubt,",
  "however, that after the war the strength of nationalist feeling in many cases forced the",
  "colonial power to grant independence long before they had intended to do so. This often",
  "had disastrous results because the new states had not been properly prepared for indepen",
  "-\u00ac",
  "dence. This was true of the British in Nigeria, the Belgians in the Congo and Rwanda",
  "Urundi, the Spanish in Spanish Sahara and the Portuguese in Mozambique and Angola.",
