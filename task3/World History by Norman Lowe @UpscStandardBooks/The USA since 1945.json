  "theSouthern Christian LeadershipConference (SCLC) wasfounded and King was.elected",
  "as its president. Its aim was to achieve full black equality by non-violent methods In the",

  "arrested and briefly impris,oned. Although the campaign had attracted world attention and",
  "sympathy, and some progress had been made, there was still a long way togo before black",
  "people could enjoy equal rights with whites. The Kennedy government was sympathetic",
  "to black aspirations but was desperately trying to keep the campaign peaceful, which was",
  ".",
  "becoming more difficult. As Howard Zinn points out how could you expect blacks to",
  "remain peaceful",
  "when bombs kept exploding in churches when new \u2018civil rights\u2019 laws did not change",

  "the root condition of black people. In the spring of 1963, the rate of unemployment for",
  "whites was 4.8 percent. For nonwhites it was 12.1 percent. According to government",
  "estimates one-fifth of the white population was below the poverty line, and one-half of",
  ",",
  "the black population was below that line. The civil rights bills emphasized voting, but",
  "voting was not a fundamental solution to racism or poverty. In Harlem, blacks who had",
  "- .",
  "voted for years, still lived in rat infested slums",
  "A huge march on Washington was organized for August 1963, to protest at the failure to",
  "solve the problem. About a quarter of a million people, both black and white, gathered to",
  "listen to the speakers, and it was here that Martin Luther King made one of his most",
  "moving speeches. He talked about his dream of a future America in which everybody",
  "would be equal:",
  "I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will",
  "not be judged by the colour of their skin, but by the content of their character.",
  "In 1964 King was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. But not everything he attempted was",
  "successful. In 1966 when he led a campaign against segregated housing in Chicago, he",
  "came up against bitter white opposition and could make no progress.",
  "King admitted that the achievements of the Civil Rights movement had not been as",
  "dramatic as he had hoped.Together with theSCLC he began the Poor People\u2019sCampaign",
  "in 1967, which aimed to alleviate poverty among black people and other disadvantaged",
  "groups such as American Indians, Puerto Ricans, Mexicans and even poor whites They",
  "aimed to present a bill of economic rights to Congress. King also launched himself into",

  ".",
  "to the civil rights campaign, as well as losing him some of his support among the whites",
  "The FBI began to harass him, but he was undeterred. Still insisting on non-violence, he",
  "decided that the way forward was to have huge demonstrations lasting over a period, and",
  "was planning what he called a Poor People\u2019s Encampment to be set up in Washington to",
  "act as a permanent reminder to the government. However, tragically, in April 1968, King",
  "was assassinated by a white man, James Earl Ray, in Memphis,Tennessee, where he had",
  "gone to support a strike of refuse workers.",
  "Dr Martin Luther King is remembered as probably the most famous of the black civil",
  "rights leaders. He was a brilliant speaker and the fact that he emphasized non-violent",
  "protest gained him much support and respect even among whites. He played a major part",
  "in the achievement of civil and political equality for black people, although, of course,",
  "others also made valuable contributions. He was not much involved, for example, in the",
  "campaign to desegregate education. He was fortunate that the presidents he had to deal",
  "with - Kennedy (1961-3) and Johnson (1963-9) - were both sympathetic to the Civil",
  "Rights movement. Kennedy admitted in 1963 that an African American had",
  "half as much chance of completing high school asa white,one-third as much chance of",
  "completing college, twice as much chance of becoming unemployed, one-seventh as",
  "much chance of earning $10,000 dollars a year, and a life expectancy which is seven",

  "by presenting a Civil Rights Bill to Congress This was delayed at first by the conserva",

  "enough to be certain of preventing another financial crash like that of 2008 Obama was",
  "determined to deal with the other source of discontent - the war in Iraq. His first act as",

  "violence,since Sunnis and Shias continued to fight each other (see Section 12.4(f))",
  "Unfortunately the war in Afghanistan was decidedly not over; by the middle of 2009",
  "the Taliban had been so successful that they controlled many areas and had set up shadow",
  "governments and law courts there. Many observers were convinced that it was impossible",

  "to defeat the Taliban militarily, and that talks would have to begin Even President Karzai",
  "of Afghanistan thought this was the only way forward. However, Obama decided to have",
  "another \u2018surge\u2019,and in December 2009 he ordered an extra 30000 troops into Afghanistan",
  "with orders to \u2018seize\u2019 the initiative\u2019.",
  "Another Obama initiative concerned the Arab-Israeli problem. In a speech in Cairo in",
  "June 2009 he had promised to form a new relationship of trust and co-operation between",
  "Islam and the USA, putting behind them years of suspicion and discord, and calming the",
  "dispute with Iran over nuclear weapons. The Iranian government made no response, but",

  "American military strength, the war in Iraq, Guantanamo and colonialism It was proba",
  "\u00ac",
  "bly because of this initiative that President Obama was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in",
  "October 2009. It was a great honour for him, but it drew mixed reactions-critics said it",
  "was too early for such an award, as he had not actually achieved anything yet. Then in a",
  "speech at the UN General Assembly (23 September 2010), he proposed that a separate",
  "Palestinian state should be set up within a year and requested President Netanyahu of",
  "Israel to stop allowing new Israeli settlements to be built on land destined to be part of",
  "Palestine. Predictably, the Israelis were furious: they protested strongly and sought",
  "support from the Israeli lobby in the USA. Massive pressure was put on Obama by the",
  ".",
  "conservatives until he felt obliged to change his position The next demand for statehood",
  "by the Palestinians in September 2011 was vetoed at the United Nations - by the USA!",
  "Understandably they felt betrayed, and the new \u2018rapprochement\u2019 between the USA and",
  "Islam was looking distinctly shaky. Nor did it help that the Guantanamo Bay prison,",
  "which in January 2009 Obama had promised would be closed within the year, was still",
  "fully operational. . In domestic affairs Obama also ran into problems: there were great",
  "objections to his healthcare reforms designed to bring some 30 million more Americans",
  "within the protection of health insurance. Eventually he was able to sign the changes into",
  "law (March 2010), but the Republicans were so determined to strike down \u2018Obamacare\u2019",
  "that 26 of the states challenged the legality of parts of the legislation via the Supreme",
  "Court. This took over two years to reach a decision -in June 2012 the Court ruled that",
  "the whole of the legislation was legal. It was due to be introduced piece by piece until it",
  "became fully operational in 2018, taking the USA closer than ever before to guaranteed",
  "coverage for everybody. In the mid-term elections of November 2010 the Democrats lost",
  "63seatsand control of the House of Representatives, probably because the economy was",
  "showing very little sign of improvement and unemployment remained static. Leading the",
  "opposition to Obama was the Tea Party movement, a conservative group which advo",
  "\u00ac",
  "cated reduced taxes, lower government spending and paying off some of the national",
  "debt; in other words, a return to general austerity. They took their name from the Boston",
  "Tea Party of 1773, when colonists had protested against the British tax on tea by dump",
  "\u00ac",
  "ing tea taken from British ships into the harbour. After months of argument, in August",

  "though even they were controversial. In December 2010 President Obama signed an",

  "Osama bin Laden, theal-Qaedaleader,had been killed by American troops in Pakistan (see",
  ".",
  "Section 12.5) This caused widespread celebrations in the USA but brought relations with",
  "Pakistan to an all-time low. As the USA moved towards the next presidential election in",

  "victory over his Republican challenger, Mitt Romney One important reason for this was",
