  "For much of the nineteenth century Britain led the rest of the world in industrial produc",
  ". \u00ac",
  "tion and trade In the last quarter of the century,Germany and the USA began to catch up,",
  "and by 1914 the USA was the world\u2019s leading industrial nation. The First and Second",
  "World Wars caused important changes in the world economy. The USA gained most,",
  "economically,from both wars, and it was the USA which became economically dominant",
  "as the world\u2019s richest nation. Meanwhile, Britain\u2019s economy slowly declined, and it was",
  ".",
  "not improved by the fact that Britain stayed outside the European Community until 1973",
  "In spite of slumps and depressions, the general trend was for the relatively wealthy",
  "industrialized countries to get wealthier, while the poorer nations of Africa and Asia",
  "(known as the Third World), most of which were once colonies of the European states,",
  "became even poorer. However, some Third World countries began to industrialize and",
  ".",
  "become richer, and this caused a split in the Third World bloc During the last quarter of",
  "the twentieth century, new developmentscame to theforefront. Industrial production and",
  "some service industries began to move from the western nations into countries such as",
  "China and India, where labour was much cheaper. Western economic systems showed",
  "signs of faltering, and there was controversy about which was the most successful type",
  "of economy - the US model or the European model. Global warming, caused by the",
  "emission of gases such as carbon dioxide, produced problematic climate changes which",
  "threatened todo most harm to the poorercountries, which were leastable tocope.During",
  "-",
  "the first decade of the twenty first century, beginning in the USA in 2008, the world",
  "suffered an unprecedented financial crisis in which, for a time, the entire capitalist",
  "system teetered on the edge of collapse. The US and various European governments",
  "saved the banking system with massive bailouts, but could not prevent the world from",
  ".",
  "plunging into recession",
  "27.1 CHANGES IN THE WORLD ECONOMY SINCE 1900",
  "In one sense, in 1900 there was already a single world economy. A few highly industrial",
  "\u00ac",
  "ized countries,mainly the USA, Britain and Germany,provided the world\u2019s manufactured",
  "goods, while the rest of the world provided raw materials and food (known as \u2018primary",
  "products\u2019). The USA treated Latin America (especially Mexico) as an area of \u2018influence\u2019,",
  "in the same way that the European states treated their colonies in Africa and elsewhere.",
  "European nations usually decided what should be produced in their colonies: the British",
  "made sure that Uganda and theSudan grew cotton for their textile industry;the Portuguese",
  "did the same in Mozambique. They fixed the prices at which colonial products were sold",
  "as low as possible, and also fixed the prices of manufactured goods exported to the",
  "colonies as high as possible. In other words, as historian Basil Davidson (see Further",
  "THECHANGING WORLDECONOMY SINCE 1900 635Reading forChapters 24and 25) putsit: \u2018the Africans had to sellcheapand buy dear\u2019.The",
  "twentieth century brought some important changes:",
  "(a) The USA became the dominant industrial power and the rest of the",
  "world became more dependent on the USA",
  "In 1880 Britain produced roughly twiceas much coaland pig iron as the USA, but by 1900",
  "the roles had been reversed: the USA produced more coal than Britain and about twice as",
  ".",
  "much pig iron and steel This growing domination continued right through the century: in",
  "1945, for example, incomes in the USA were twice as high as in Britain and seven times",
  "higher than in the USSR; during the next 30 years, American production almost doubled",
  "again. What were the causes of the American success?",
  "1 The FirstWorldWar and after",
  "The First World War and its aftermath gave a big boost to the American economy (see",
  ".",
  "Section 22.3) Many countries which had boughtgoodsfrom Europe during the war (such",
  "as China and the statesof Latin America) were unable to get hold of supplies because the",
  "war had disrupted trade. This forced them to buy goods from the USA (and also Japan)",
  "instead, and after the war they continued to do so. The USA was the economic winner of",
  "the First World War and became even richer thanks to the interest on the war loans it had",
  ".",
  "made to Britain and herallies (seeSection 4.5) Only the USA was richenough to provide",
  "loans to encourage German recovery during the 1920s, but this had the unfortunate effect",
  ".",
  "of linking Europe too closely with the USAfinancially and economically When the USA",
  "suffered its great slump (1929-35) (see Section 22.6), Europe and the rest of the world",
  ".",
  "were also thrown into depression In 1933, in the depth of the depression, about 25",
  "million people were out of work in the USA and as many as 50 million in the world as a",

  "2 The SecondWorldWar",
  "The Second World War left the USA the world\u2019s greatest industrial (and military) power.",
  "The Americans entered the war relatively late and their industry did well out of supplying",
  ".",
  "war materials for Britain and her allies At the end of the war, with Europe almost at a",
  "standstill economically,the USA was producing 43percentof the world\u2019s iron ore,45 per",
  "cent of its crude steel, 60 per cent of its railway locomotives and 74 per cent of its motor",
  "vehicles (see also Section 22.7(e)).When the war wasover, the industrial boom continued",
  "as industry switched to producing consumer goods, which had been in short supply during",
  "the war. Once again, only the USA was rich enough to help western Europe, which it did",
  "with Marshall Aid (see Section 7.2(e)). It was not simply that the Americans wanted to be",
  "kind to Europe: they had at least two other ulterior motives:",
  "(cid:127)",
  "a prosperous western Europe would be able to buy American goods and thus keep",
  "the great American wartime boom going;",
  "(cid:127) a prosperous western Europe would be less likely to go communist.",
  "(b) After 1945 the world split into capitalist and communist blocs",
  "(cid:127)",
  "The capitalist bloc consisted of the highly developed industrial nations-the USA,",
  "Canada, western Europe, Japan, Australia and New Zealand. They believed in",
  "private enterprise and private ownership of wealth, with profit as the great motivat",

  "have been better spent helping to solve the problems of the world\u2019s poorer nations.",
  "(c) The 1970s and 1980s: serious economic problems in the USA",
  "After many years of continual economic success, the US began to experience problems.",
  "(cid:127) Defence costs and the war in Vietnam (1961-75) (see Section 8.3) were a constant",
  "drain on the economy and the treasury.",
  "(cid:127) There was a budget deficit every year in the late 1960s.This means that thegovern",
  "\u00ac",
  "ment was spending more money than it was collecting in taxes, and the difference",
  "had to be covered by selling gold reserves. By 1971 the dollar, which was once",
  "considered to be as good as gold, was weakening in value.",
  "I (cid:127) President Nixon was forced to devalue the dollar by about 12 per cent and to put a",

  "(cid:127)",
  "Another problem forThird Worldcountries was that their populations were increas",
  "\u00ac",
  "ing much faster than those in the North. In 1975 the total world population stood at",
  "about 4000 million, and it was expected to reach 6000 million by 1997. Since the",

  "Liberia,Sierra Leone, Mozambique and Angola",

  "more prosperous, because that would enable the South to buy more goodsfrom the North.",
  "This would help to avoid unemployment and recession in the North. If just a fraction of",

  "could be made. For example, for the price of one jet fighter (about $20 million), 40 000",

  "\u00ac",
  "mendations which, if carried out, would at least eliminate hunger from the world:",
  "(cid:127) the rich nations of the North should aim to be giving 0.7 per cent of their national",

  "-",
  "(cid:127) a new World Development Fund should be set up in which decision making would",
  "be more evenly shared between lenders and borrowers (not like the International",
  "Monetary Fund and the World Bank, which were dominated by the USA);",
  "(cid:127) an international energy plan should be drawn up;",
  "(cid:127) there should be a campaign to improve agricultural techniques in the South,and an",

  "Did the Brandt Report change anything? Sadly, there was no immediate improvement",
  "in the general economic situation of the South. By 1985 very few countries had reached",
  "the suggested 0.7 per cent giving target.Those that did were Norway, Sweden, Denmark,",
  "the Netherlands and France; however, the USA gave only 0.24 per cent and Britain 0.11",

  "whereas the plight of the Third World became even more serious. At the end of 2003 the",
  "UN reported that 21 Third World states, 17 of them in Africa, were in crisis because of a",
  "combination of natural disasters, AIDS, global warming and civil wars (see Section",
  "25.15). Yet the richest 1 per cent of the world\u2019s population (around 60 million) received",
  "642 PART VI THECHANGING WORLDECONOMY SINCE 1900.",
  "as much income as the poorest 57 per cent Norway was top of the UN\u2019s league table for",
  "human development: Norwegians had a life expectancy of 78.7 years, there was a liter",

  "Leone life expectancy was about 35, the literacy rate was 35 per cent and annual income",
  "averaged $470. The USA seemed to attract the most hostility and resentment on account",
  "of this imbalance of wealth; it was widely believed that the growth of terrorism - espe",

  "27.3 THE SPLIT IN THE THIRD WORLD ECONOMY",
  "During the 1970s some Third World states began to become more prosperous, some",

  "Some Third World states were lucky enough to have oil resources In 1973 the members",
  "of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), partly in an attempt to",
  ". -",
  "conserve oil supplies, began to charge more for their oil The Middle East oil producing",
  "states made huge profits, as did Nigeria and Libya. This did not necessarily mean that",
  "their governments spent the money wisely or for the benefit of their populations. One",
  "African success story, however, was provided by Libya, the richest country in Africa",
  "thanks to its oil resources and the shrewd policies of its leader, Colonel Gaddafi (who",
  "took power in 1969). He used much of the profits from oil on agricultural and industrial",
  "development, and to set up a welfare state. This was one country where ordinary people",
  "benefited from oil profits; with a GNP of \u00a35460 in 1989, Libya could claim to be almost",

  "(b) Industrialization",
  ".",
  "Some Third World states industrialized rapidly and with great success These included",
  "Singapore, Taiwan, South Korea and Hong Kong (known as the four \u2018Pacific tiger\u2019",
  "economies), and among others, Thailand, Malaysia, Brazil and Mexico.",
  "The GNPs of the four \u2018tiger\u2019 economies compared favourably with those of many",
  "European Community countries. The success of the newly industrialized countries in",
  "world export markets was made possible partly because they were able to attract firms",
  "from the North who were keen to take advantage of the much cheaper labour available in",
  "the Third World. Some firms even shifted all their production to newly industrialized",
  "countries, where low production costsenabled them to sell their goodsat lower prices than",
  ".",
  "goods produced in the North This posed serious problemsfor the industrialized nationsof",
  "the North, which were all suffering high unemployment during the 1990s. It seemed that",
  "THECHANGING WORLDECONOMY SINCE 1900 643the golden days of western prosperity might have gone, at least for the foreseeable future,",
  "unless their workers were prepared to accept lower wages, or unless companies were",

  "prepared to make do with lower profits",
  "In the mid-1990s the world economy was moving into the next stage, in which the",
  "Asian \u2018tigers\u2019 found themselves losing jobs to workers in countries such as Malaysia and",
  "the Philippines. Other Third World states in the process of industrializing were Indonesia",
  "and China, where wages were even lower and hours of work longer. Jacques Chirac, the",

  "(c) Genetically modified (GM) crops",
  "One of the economic issues that came to the forefront during the 1990s, and which devel",
  "\u00ac",
  "oped into a political confrontation between the USA and the EU, was the growing of",
  "genetically modified crops. These are plants injected with genes from other plants which",
  ".",
  "give the crops extra characteristics For example, some crops can be made to tolerate",
  "herbicides that kill all other plants; this means that the farmer can spray the crop with a",
  "-",
  "\u2018broad spectrum\u2019 herbicide that will destroy every other plant in the field except his crop.",
  "Since weeds use up precious water and soil nutrients, GM crops should produce higher",
  "yields and require less herbicide than conventional crops. Some GM crops have been",
  "modified to produce a poison which kills pests that feed on them, others have been modi",
  "\u00ac",
  "fied so that they will grow in salty soil. The main GM crops grown are wheat, barley,",
  "maize, oilseed rape, soya beans and cotton. Advocates of GM crops claim that they repre",
  "\u00ac",
  "sent one of the greatest advances ever achieved in farming; they provide healthier food,",
  ".",
  "produced in a more efficient and environmentally friendly way Given the problem of the",
  "growing world population and the difficulties of feeding everybody, supporters see GM",
  "crops as perhaps a vital breakthrough in solving the world food problem. By 2004 they",
  "were being grown by at least 6 million farmers in 16 countries, including the USA,",
  ".",
  "Canada,India, Argentina, Mexico, China,Colombia and South Africa The main support",
  "\u00ac",
  "ers of GM crops were the Americans, who were also the world\u2019s largest exporter.",
  "However, not everybody was happy about this situation. Many people object to GM",
  "technology on the grounds that it can be used to create unnatural organisms - plants can",
  "be modified with genes from another plant or even from an animal. There are fears that",
  "genes might escape into wild plants and create \u2018superweeds\u2019 that cannot be killed; GM",
  "crops might be harmful to other species and also in the long term to the humans who eat",
  "THECHANGING WORLDECONOMY SINCE 1900 647them. Genes escaping from GM crops might be able to pollinate organically growing",
  "crops, which would min the organic farmers involved. These unfortunate farmersi might",
  "tind themselves being sued for having GM genes in their crops,even though they had not",
  "knowingly planted such seeds. The main objections came from Europe; although some",
  "European countries - Germany and Spain for example - grew GM crops, the amounts",
  "were small. Scientists on the whole tended to reserve judgement, claiming that there",
  "should be long field trials to show whether or not GM crops were harmful, both for the",
  "environment and for public health. Opinion polls showed that around 80 per cent of the",
  "European public had grave doubts about their safety; several countries, including Austria,",
  "France, Germany, Italy and Greece, banned importsof individual GMs either for growing",
  "or for use as food. Americans, on the other hand, insisted that the crops had been thor",
  "\u00ac",
  "oughly tested and approved by thegovernment,and that people had been eatingGM foods",
  "for several years without any apparent ill effects.",
  "Another European objection was that the GM industry was controlled by a few giant",
  "agriculture businesses, most of them American. In fact, by 2004 the American company",
  "Monsanto was producing more than 90 per cent of GM crops worldwide.The feeling was",
  "that such companies had too much control over world food production, which would",
  "enable them toexert pressure on countries to buy their productsand force more traditional",
  "farmers out of the market. The controversy came to a head in April 2004 when the USA",
  "called on the World Trade Organization (WTO) to take action. The USA accused the EU",
  "of breaking WTOfree-trade rules by banningGM imports without any scientificevidence",
  "tosupport their case.",
  "However by no meansdoeseverybody in the USA support GM farming. An organiza",
  ", \u00ac",
  "tion called the Centre for Food Safety (CFS) has launched several cases in the Supreme",
  "Court, most notably in 2006 when a group of organic alfalfa farmers sued Monsanto for",
  "growing GM alfalfa without first carrying out safety checks. They were afraid that their",
  ",",
  "organic alfalfa would be cross-pollinated by GM alfalfa, which would make their organic",
  "alfalfa unsaleable in countries where GM crops were banned. The judgement was that the",
  "planting of GM alfalfa should stop until a full-scale investigation into possible ill effects",
  "had been carried out. A spokesman for Monsantostated that they were confident that tests",
  "would be completed in time for the autumn planting in 2010. Encouraged by this result,",
  ".",
  "the CFS organized another lawsuit against Monsanto in 2009 this time against the grow",
  "\u00ac",
  "ingof GM sugar beet.In August 2010asimilarjudgement halted the plantingof GM sugar",
  "beet until the necessary tests had been completed.",
  "At the same time not everybody in Europe was against GM farming. In Britain, for",
  "example,at the Rothamsted Agricultural Research Centre at Harpenden,experiments were",
  "being carried out with GM wheat which is resistant to several kinds of insects and should",
  "therefore need fewer pesticides. In June 2012 a group of protesters calling themselves",
  "\u2018Take the Flour Back\u2019 threatened to destroy the crop. Several hundred protesters, includ",
  "\u00ac",
  "ing some from France, attempted to invade the research centre, but were prevented by a",
  "large police presence. Fortunately they were persuaded tocall off their plan and meet the",
  "research team for discussions. At the end of June 2012 it was revealed that recent tests in",
  "Chinaon GM cotton cropsshowed that some insects were developing increased resistance",
  "tothesecrops,and that an increasing numberof other pests weredeveloping in and around",
  "the cotton crop, and these were affecting surrounding crops too. In other words, the early",
  "benefits were now being replaced by unexpected problems. And so the basic problem still",
  "remains: how is agriculture going to produce enough to feed the steadily growing world",
  "population, given that the amount of land suitable for agricultural production makes up",
  "only about 11 per cent of the earth\u2019s surface, and that a lot of this land is being contami",
  "\u00ac",
  "nated by salt (salination), and therefore unsuitable for agriculture? Continuing global",
  ".",
  "warmingand risingsea levelsare not likely toimprove thesituation (see the next section)",
  "At least there was one piece of good news in 2012 - in March it was announced that",
  "648",
  "PARTVI THECHANGING WORLDECONOMYSINCE 1900Australian scientists had tested a new strain of wheat that could increase yields by 25 per",
  "cent in saline soils. Perhaps in the end, if the world is to survive, we shall have no choice",

  "but to accept GM produce On the other hand it could be that scientists will succeed in",

  "producing new non GM strainsof allfoodstuffs,like the Australian wheat, which willgive",
  "higher yields from the same size of land area.",
  "27.5 GLOBAL WARMING",
  "(a) Early concerns",
  "In the early 1970s scientists became concerned about what they called the \u2018greenhouse",
  "effect\u2019 - the apparently uncontrollable warming of the earth\u2019s atmosphere, or \u2018global",
  "warming\u2019,asit became known.It wascaused by largeamountsof carbon dioxide, methane",
  "and nitrous oxide, three gases produced during various industrial processes and by the",
  "burning of fossilfuels, being released into theatmosphere.Thesegasesacted like theglass",
  "roof of a greenhouse, trapping and magnifying the sun\u2019s heat. Opinions differed about",
  "exactly what its effects would be;one alarming theory was that the ice caps, glaciers and",
  "snow in the polar regions would melt, causing the level of the sea to rise, and flooding",
  "large areas of land. It wasalso feared that Africa and large partsof Asia could become too",
  ".",
  "hot for people to live in, and there could be violent storms and prolonged drought",
  "Some scientists dismissed these theories, arguing that if indeed the world was becom",
  ". \u00ac",
  "ing warmer, it was a natural climatic change, not a man-made one They played down the",
  "threatsof flooding and drought,and accused those who suggested them of being anti-West",
  "- .",
  "and anti industrialization Industrialists themselves naturally welcomed these sympathiz",
  "\u00ac",
  "ers, and as the debate between the two camps developed, nothing was done to reduce or",
  "control emissions of greenhouse gases.",
  "Gradually the scientificevidence became moreconvincing: the Earth\u2019saverage temper",
  "\u00ac",
  "ature was definitely increasing significantly,and thefossil-burning habitsof humans were",
  "-",
  "responsible for the changes. The evidence was enough to convince US vice president A1",
  "Gore, who in 1992 wrote a pamphlet advocating international action to combat the green",
  "\u00ac",
  "house effect. President Clinton later proclaimed: \u2018We must stand together against the",
  "threat of global warming. A greenhouse may be a good place to raise plants; it is no place",
  "to nurture our children.\u2019 In June 1992 the UN organized the Earth Summit conference in",
  "Rio de Janeiro (Brazil) to discuss the situation. Representatives of 178 nations attended,",
  "including 117 heads of state; it was probably the largest gathering of world leaders in",
  "history.Mostof them signeda rangeof treaties undertaking to protect theenvironmentand",
  "reduce emissions of greenhouse gases.",
  "However, signing treaties was one thing, enforcing them was quite another. For exam",
  "\u00ac",
  "ple,in 1993 when President Clinton introduced a bill to tax energy, the Republican major",
  "\u00ac",
  "ity in the Senate, many of whose supporters were industrialists and businessmen, threw it",
  "out. By this time many other countries were showing concern at the worsening situation.",
  "In 1995 an Intergovernmental Panel on Climatic Change produced a report outlining the",
  "probable effects of global warming and concluding that there could be little doubt that",
  ".",
  "human actions were to blame",
  "(b) The Kyoto Convention (1997) and after",
  "In 1997 another large international conference was held, this time in Kyoto (Japan), to",
  ".",
  "work outaplan for reducing harmful emissions It wasappropriate that the conference was",
  "held in Kyoto, since, of all the industrialized countries, the Japanese had achieved most",
  "THECHANGING WORLDECONOMY SINCE 1900 649success in limiting their carbon emissions; and they had achieved it by heavy taxation on",
  "power and petrol. Statistics were worked out to show how much carbon each country was",
  "producing. The USA was by far the biggest culprit, emitting an average of 19 tons of",
  "carbon per head a year; Australia was not far behind with 16.6 tons per head.. Japan emit\u00ac",
  "ted 9 tons per head a year, while the countries of the EU averaged 8.5 tons On the other",
  "hand, the countries of the Third World emitted very modest amounts per head - South",
  ".",
  "America 2.2 tons and Africa less than one ton",
  "The target set was to return global emissions to their 1990 levels by 2012. This meant",
  "that countries would have to reduce their emissions by different amounts to comply with",
  "the regulations; for example, the USA was required to reduce by 7 per cent, whereas",
  "France needed no reduction,since by 1997 the French were producing 60 percent of their",
  "energy from nuclear power. In the end, 86 nations signed the agreement, which became",
  "known as the Kyoto Protocol. However, over the next few years this seemed to have little",
  "effect; in 2001 the Intergovernmental Panel on Climatic Change reported that climatic",
  "conditions were getting steadily worse. The 1990s was the hottest decade ot the millen",
  "\u00ac",
  "nium and 1998 was the hottest year. In March 2001 the Kyoto Protocol was dealt a fatal",
  "blow when newly elected US President Bush announced that he would not ratify it. \u2018I will",
  "not accept a plan that will harm our economy and hurt American workers', he said. \u2018First",
  "things first are the people who live in America. That\u2019s my priority.'",
  "-",
  "Thus, early in the twenty first century the world found itself in a situation where the",
  "USA, with no more than 6 per cent of the planet's population, was emitting a quarter of",
  "all the greenhouse gases, and would continue todo so, whatever the consequences for the",
  "rest of the world. In 2003 the effects of global warming were increasingly worrying. The",
  "UN calculated that at least 150 000 people had died during the year as a direct result of",
  ".",
  "climate change - prolonged drought and violent storms During that summer, 25 000",
  "people died in Europe because of the unusually high temperatures. The increased warmth",
  "and the storms provided ideal breeding conditions for mosquitoes, which were spreading",
  "into mountainous areas where it had been too cold for them. Consequently the death rate",
  "from malaria increased sharply, especially in Africa. Droughts caused famine and malnu\u00ac",
  "trition, so that people were more prone to catch life-threatening diseases.",
  "(c) What happens next?",
  "It was clear toclimatologists that drastic measures were needed if dire consequences were",
  "to be avoided. Sir John Houghton, the former head of the British Meteorological Office,",
  "compared climate change to a weapon of mass destruction: \u2018like terrorism, this weapon",
  "knows no boundaries. It can strike anywhere, in any form - a heatwave in one place, a",
  "drought ora flood ora storm surge in another.' It was also being suggested that the Kyoto",
  "agreement, designed when climate change was thought to be less destructive, would be",
  "insufficient to make much difference to the problem even if it were fully implemented.",
  ",",
  "The tragedy is that the world\u2019s poorest countries, which havecontributed hardly anything",
  "to the build-up of greenhouse gases, are likely to be the ones most seriously affected.",
  "Recently published statistics suggested that in 2004 some 420 million people were living",
  "in countries which no longer had enough crop land to grow their own food; half a billion",
  "pressure",
  "people lived in areas prone tochronic drought.The threats areexacerbated by the",
  "of the growing world population (see Sections 28.1-3). A number of measures have been",
  "suggested:",
  "(cid:127) Professor John Schnellnhuber, director of the UK-based Tyndall Centre, which",

  "(a) The American economic model",

  "There was, he said, no possibility of a financial crisis in America. Yet, little over a year",
  "later the American system and the whole global economy seemed to be on the verge of",
  "total collapse. In fact some experts had been predicting collapse for some years, but had",
  "been proved wrong. However, in March 2008 the unthinkable happened-it was revealed",
  "that one of the oldest and most respected Wall Street investment banks, Bear Stearns, was",
  "in serious trouble. It had lost $1.6 billion when some affiliated hedge funds collapsed, but",
  "much worse, it had a problem with bad debts estimated at $220 billion. Reluctantly, US",
  "treasury secretary, Henry Paulson, decided that Bear Stearns could not be allowed to",
  "collapse, since that might inconvenience or even ruin many of the rich citizens who had",
  "entrusted their wealth to the bank. There was a rule that the US government should never",
  "bail out an investment bank,so it was arranged that another bank,J. P.Morgan, should be",
  "provided with Federal Reserve funds to enable it to take over Bear Stearns. This indirect",
  "Federal Reserve bailout of Bear Stearns saved the system from collapsing. Unfortunately,",
  "it also left the impression that any other bank that got itself into difficulties would always",
  "be able to rely on a government bailout. In financial circles this was described as \u2018moral",
  "hazard\u2019 -the idea that there are some investors who believe that they are \u2018too big to fail\u2019,",

  "and who therefore take reckless risks",

  "was Lehman Brothers allowed to collapse? Government and state financial bosses like",
  "Paulson and Geithner were determined that there should be no such thing as \u2018moral",
  "hazard\u2019 -state takeovers should not become a habit, because it was seen as state capital",
  "\u00ac",
  "ism. In a country that almost worshipped free-market capitalism, the idea that private",
  "companiesand banks should be subsidizedor taken over by the government was sacrilege.",
  ".",
  "One leading financier remarked: \u2018I just think it is disgusting; this is not American \u2019",
  "Unfortunately, the crisis worsened rapidly and the government found it impossible to",
  "maintain its free-market stance. Another struggling investment bank, Merrill Lynch, was",
  "taken over by the Bank of America (BOA).Then came the biggestsensation so far: a giant",
  "insurancecompany, American InternationalGroup (AIG),asked thegovernmentfora loan",

  "many bad or \u2018toxic\u2019 debts, as they were now being called The government was in a",

  "effect, the US government had nationalized AIG, though the word itself was never used",
  "The UK banking system was already in trouble before the US crisis began, mainly",
  "because the Bank of England was reluctant to pump money into the system and failed to",
  "reduce interest rates on borrowing. The UK mortgage bank, Northern Rock, which had",
  "been forced to reduce its lending because of its own dependence on short-term borrowing",
  "(see below (b)3), collapsed in September 2007. It was eventually nationalized at a cost of",
  "THECHANGING WORLDECONOMY SINCE 1900 655some \u00a3100 billion. In September 2008 Halifax Bank of Scotland (HBOS) was saved from",
  "collapse when it was taken over by Lloyds TSB for \u00a312 billion in a deal arranged by",
  "British prime minister Gordon Brown. However, its share price fell rapidly, so that only a",
  "tew weeks later its value had slumped to \u00a34 billion. This brought Lloyds TSB to its knees",
  "as well and it toohad to be rescued by the government. Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) was",
  "partly nationalized, so that it became 83 per cent taxpayer-owned. Shares in European",
  "banks followed suit; Fortis, the huge Dutch-Belgian bank, lost almost half its value in just",
  "a few days and was taken into joint ownership by the two governments. In Germany,",
  "France, the Irish Republic and Iceland similar bailouts were taking place. And most of this",
  "happened in just a few days in September 2008.Thesituation wasexacerbated by millions",
  "of ordinary depositors rushing to withdraw their funds from the banks. Lending between",
  "banks had more or less dried up because the inter-bank lending rates (known as LIBOR)",
  "were prohibitive.",
  "By the time the crisis passed, the US Treasury had acquired stakes in several more",
  "major financial institutions, including Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, J. P. Morgan",
  "Chase, and two mortgage underwriters, Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae. The function of",
  "these last two institutions was not to provide mortgagesdirectly to house-buyers, but toact",
  "as an insurance by underwriting mortgages given by other banks. Much of the help was",
  "provided under the Bush administration's Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) and",
  "later by the Obama administration s Public-Private Investment Program. According toan",
  "official report in July 2009 TARP had saddled the taxpayers of the USA with a debt of",

  "$27.3 trillion. By that time the crisis had developed into a global recession. The whole",
  "bailout operation was extremely controversial. President Bush was accused of being un-",

  "He argues that the system known as neo-liberalism that had been in operation for the last",

  "was also resentment in some of the more economically successful north European states,",
  "especially in Germany, at having to bail out what many saw as the \u2018feckless, reckless and",
  "lazy' south.The most likely outcome seemed to be that the taxpayers of northern Europe",
  "would bail out the south and would, in effect, take control of overall eurozone economic",
  "policy so that the eurozone would become much closer to being a fiscal union and there",

  "On the other hand, many economists and financiers believed that the euro must be",
  "saved. In September 2012 Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank",

  "considerable damage to their exports. Hopes for the survival of the euro revived in",
  "September 2012 when Mario Draghi unveiled a rescue plan that involved the ECB buying",
  "up the bonds of Spain and Italy the two eurozone countries after Greece most heavily in",

  "debt. Those governments could then request a bailout from the ECB which would be",
  "granted, provided they agreed to implement strict austerity measures.The announcement",

  "bothsidesof the Atlantic, and sodid confidence in theeuro\u2019ssurvival.This wassufficient",
  "tobring down borrowing costs for Spain and Italy,and their future seemed brighter. Even",
  "the Germans agreed to go along with the scheme. At first the German Bundesbank",
  "condemned the whole idea as \u2018tantamount to financing governments by printing",
  "banknotes'. But eventually, after pressure from Chancellor Merkel and Mario Draghi",
  "himself, followed a few days later by the approval of the German constitutional court, the",
