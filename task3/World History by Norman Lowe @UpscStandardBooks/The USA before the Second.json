  "by this time the leaderof theSocialist Party, wasat the inaugural meeting,and so was \u2018Big",
  "Bill\u2019 Haywood, a miners\u2019 leader, who became the main driving force behind the IWW. It",
  "included socialists, anarchists and radical trade unionists; their aim was to form \u2018One Big",
  "Union\u2019 to include all workers across the country, irrespective of race, sex or level of",
  "employment. Although they were not in favour of starting violence, they were quite",
  "prepared to resist if they were attacked. They believed in strikes as an important weapon",

  "course of which the workers train themselves for concerted action, to prepare for the final",
  "\u201ccatastrophe\u201d -the generalstrike which willcomplete theexpropriationof theemployers\u2019.",
  "This was fighting talk,and although the IWW never had more than 10 000 members at",
  ".",
  "any one time, employers and property owners saw them as a threat to be taken seriously",
  "They enlisted the help of all possible groups to destroy the IWW. Local authorities were",
  "persuaded to pass laws banning meetings and speaking in public;gangs of vigilantes were",
  "hired to attack IWW members; leaders were arrested. In Spokane, Washington, in 1909,",
  "600 people were arrested and jailed for attempting to make public speeches in the street;",
  "eventually, when all the jails were full, the authorities relented and granted the right to",

  "Undeterred, the IWW continued to campaign, and over the next few years members",
  "travelledaround thecountry toorganizestrikes wherever they wereneeded-in California,",
  "Washington State, Massachusetts, Louisiana and Colorado, among other places. One of",
  "their few outright successes came with a strike of woollen weavers in Lawrence,",
  "Massachusetts,in 1912.The workers,mainly immigrants, walked outof thefactoriesafter",
  "learning that their wages were to be reduced. The IWW moved in and organized pickets,",
  "paradesand mass meetings.Membersof theSocialist Party also became involved, helping",
  "to raise funds and make sure the children were fed. The situation became violent when",
  "police attacked a parade; eventually state militia and even federal cavalry were called in,",
  "and several strikers were killed. But they held out for over two months until the mill",

  "However, successes like this were limited, and working conditions generally did not",

  "workers had been killed that year in industrial accidents Many of those sympathetic to the",

  "ideals of socialism",
  "By 1910 the party had some 100 000 members and Debs ran for president in 1908,",
  "though he polled only just over 400 000 votes. The importance of the socialist movement",
  "483",
  "THEUSA BEFORETHESECONDWORLDWARwas that it publicized the need for reform and influenced both major parties, which",
  "acknowledged, however reluctantly, that some changes were needed, if only to steal the",
  "socialists\u2019 thunder and beat off their challenge. Debs ran for president again in 1912, but",
  "by that time the political scene had changeddramatically.The ruling Republican Party had",
  "split: its more reform-minded members set up the Progressive Republican League (1910)",
  "-",
  "with a programme that included the eight hour day, prohibition of child labour, votes for",
  "women and a national system of social insurance. It even expressed support for labour",
  "unions, provided they were moderate in their behaviour. The Progressives decided to run",
  "former president Theodore Roosevelt against the official Republican candidate William",
  ".",
  "Howard Taft The Democrat Party also had its progressive wing, and their candidate for",
  "-",
  "president was Woodrow Wilson, a well known reformer who called his programme the",
  "\u2018New Freedom\u2019.",
  "Faced with these choices,the American Federation of Labor stayed with the Democrats",
  "as the most likely party to actually carry out its promises, while the IWW supported Debs.",
  "With the Republican vote divided between Roosevelt (4.1 million) and Taft (3.5 million),",
  "Wilson waseasily elected president (6.3million votes).Debs(900672) more than doubled",
  "his previous vote, indicating that support for socialism was still increasing despite the",
  ".",
  "efforts of the progressives in both major parties During Wilson\u2019s presidency (1913-21) a",
  "number of important reforms were introduced, including a law forbidding child labour in",
  "factories and sweatshops. More often than not, however, it was the state governments",
  "which led the way; for example, by 1914, nine states had introduced votes for women; it",
  "was only in 1920 that women\u2019s suffrage became part of the federal constitution. Hugh",
  "Brogan sums up Wilson\u2019s reforming achievement succinctly: \u2018By comparison with the",
  "past, his achievements were impressive; measured against what needed to be done, they",
  "were almost trivial.\u2019",
  "(d) The First World War and the Russian revolutions",
  "When the First World War began in August 1914, Wilson pledged, to the relief of the vast",
  "majority of the American people, that the USA would remain neutral. Having won the",
  "1916 election largely on the strength of the slogan \u2018He Kept Us Out of the War\u2019, Wilson",

  "exactly the right timefor the president-he talked of \u2018the wonderful and heartening things",
  "that have been happening in the last few weeks in Russia\u2019. The point was that many",
  "Americans had been unwilling for their country to enter the war because it meant being",
  "allied to the most undemocratic state in Europe. Now that tsarism wasfinished,an alliance",
  "with the apparently democratic Provisional Government was much more acceptable. Not",
  "that the American people were enthusiastic about the war; according to Howard Zinn:",
  ".",
  "There is no persuasive evidence that the public wanted war The government had to",

  "This disaster isalways rememberedastheWallStreet Crash Itseffectsspread rapidly:",
  "so many people in financial difficulties rushed to the banks to draw out their savings that",
  ".",
  "thousands of banks had to close As the demand for goods fell,factories closed down and",
  "unemployment rose alarmingly. The great boom had suddenly turned into the Great",
  "Depression. It rapidly affected not only the USA, but other countries as well, and so it",
  ".",
  "became known as the world economic crisis The Wall Street Crash did not cause the",
  "depression; it was just a symptom of a problem whose real causes lay much deeper.",
  "(b) What caused the Great Depression?",
  "/ Domestic overproduction",
  "American industrialists, encouraged by high profits and helped by increased mechaniza",
  "\u00ac",
  "tion, were producing too many goods for the home market to absorb (in the same way as",
  "thefarmers).Thiswasnotapparentin theearly 1920s,butas the 1930sapproached,unsold",
  ".",
  "stocks of goods began to build up, and manufacturers produced less Since fewer workers",
  "were required, men were laid off; and as there was no unemployment benefit, these men",
  ". .",
  "and their families bought less And so the vicious circle continued",
  "2 Unequal distribution of income",
  "The enormous profits being made by industrialists were not being distributed equally",
  "among the workers. The average wage for industrial workers rose by about 8 per cent",
  "between 1923and 1929, but during the same period, industrial profits increased by 72 per",
  "cent. An 8 percent increase in wages (only 1.4 percent in real terms) meant that there was",
  "not enough buying power in the hands of the general public to sustain the boom; they",
  "could manage to absorb goods produced for a limited time, with the help of credit, but by",
  "1929 they were fast approaching the limit. Unfortunately manufacturers, usually super",
  "\u00ac",
  "corporations, were not prepared to reduce prices or to increase wages substantially,and so",
  "a glut of consumer goods built up.",
  "-",
  "This refusal by the manufacturers to make some compromise was short sighted to say",
  "the least;at the beginning of 1929 there were still millionsof Americans who had no radio,",
  "no electric washing machine and no car because they could not afford them. If employers",
  "hadallowed larger wage increasesand been content with lessprofit,there is no reason why",
  "the boom could not have continued for several more years while its benefits were more",
  "widely shared. Even so, a slump was still not inevitable, provided the Americans could",
  ".",
  "export their surplus products",
  "3 Falling demand for exports",
  "However, exports began to fall away, partly because foreign countries were reluctant to",
  "buy American goods when the Americans themselves put up tariff barriers to protect their",
  "industriesfrom foreign imports. Although the Fordney-McCumber tariff (1922) helped to",
  "keep foreign goods out, at the same time it prevented foreign states, especially those in",
  ".",
  "Europe, from making much-needed profits from trade with the USA Without those prof",
  "\u00ac",
  "its, the nations of Europe would be unable to afford American goods, and they would be",
  "struggling to pay their war debts to the USA. To make matters worse, many states retali",

  "the way",
  "4 Speculation",
  "The situation was worsened by agreat rush of speculation on the New York stock market,",
  "which began to gather momentum about 1926. Speculation is the buying of shares in",
  "companies; people with cash to spare chose to do this for two possible motives:",
  "490 PART IV THEUNITEDSTATES OFAMERICA(cid:127) to get the dividend-the annualsharing-out of acompany\u2019s profitsamong itsshare",

  "holders;",

  ".",
  "them",
  "In the mid-1920s it was the second motive which most attracted investors: as company",
  "profits increased, more people wanted to buy shares; this forced share prices up and there",
  "were plenty of chancesof quick profitsfrom buying and selling shares.The average value",
  "of ashare rosefrom $9 in 1924 to $26 in 1929.Share pricesof some companies rosespec",

  "but there was enormous confidence that prosperity would continue indefinitely",
  "Thisconfidence lasted wellon into 1929, but when thefirstsignsappeared thatsalesof",

  "grip of depression",
  "(c) How did the depression affect people?",
  "1 To begin with, the stock market crash ruined millions of investors who had paid",

  "The measures which go to make up the New Deal were introduced over the years 1933",
  "to 1940. Some historians have talked about a \u2018First\u2019 and a \u2018Second\u2019 New Deal starting",
  "in 1935, and even a \u2018Third\u2019, each with different characteristics. However, Michael",
  "Heale believes that this oversimplifies the subject. \u2018The Roosevelt administration\u2019, he",
  "writes, \u2018was never governed by a single political ideology, and its components were",
  "always pulling in different directions. Broadly, however, it is fair to say that from 1935",
  "the New Deal moved closer to the political left in that it stumbled into an uneasy",
  ".",
  "alliance with organised labour and showed a greater interest in social reform \u2019 For the",
  "\u2018first hundred days\u2019 he concentrated on emergency legislation to deal with the ongoing",

  "was achieved by the government taking over the banks temporarily and guaranteeing that",

  "depositors would not lose their cash if there was another financial crisis This restored",
  "confidence, and money began to flow into the banks again. The Securities Exchange",
  "Commission (1934) reformed the stock exchange; among other things, it insisted that",
  "people buying shares on credit must make a down payment of at least 50 per cent instead",
  ".",
  "of only 10 per cent",
  "2 The Farmers\u2019 Relief Act(1933)andthe Agricultural Adjustment Administration(AAA)",
  "It was important to help farmers, whose main problem was that they were still producing",
  "too much,which kept pricesand profits low. Under the Act, the government paid compen",

  "(d) What did the New Deal achieve?",
  "It has to be said that it did not achieve all that FDR' had hoped.Some of the measures",
  "failed completely or were only partially successful. The Farmers\u2019 Relief Act, forexam",
  "ple.certainly helped farmers, but it threw many farm labourers out of work. Nordi-ditdo\u00ac",
  "much to help farmers living in parts of Kansas, Oklahoma and Texas; in the mid 1930s",
  "these areas were badly hit by drought and soil erosion, which turned them into a huge",
  "\u2018dustbowl\u2019 (see Map 22.1). Although unemployment was reduced to less than 8 million",
  "by 1937 it wasstill aserious problem. Part of the failure wasdue to theSupremeCourts",
  ",",
  "opposition. Another reason was that although he was bold in many ways, Roosevelt was",
  "toocautious in the amounts of money he was prepared to spend to stimulate industry.In",
  "1938 he reduced government spending,causing another recession, which sent unemploy\u00ac",
  "ment up to 10.5 million.The New Deal thereforedid not rescue the USA fromthedepres\u00ac",
  "sion; it was only the war effort which brought unemployment below the million markin",
  "1943.",
  "Still, in spite of this, Roosevelt's first eight years in office were a remarkable period.",
  "Never before had an American government intervened so directly in the lives of ordinary",
  "people; never before had so much attention been focused on an American president.And",
  "much wasachieved.",

  "PARTIV THEUNITEDSTATESOFAMERICA(e) The Second World War and the American economy",
  "It was the war that finally put an end to the depression. The USA entered the war in",
  "December 1941 after the Japanese had bombed the American naval base at Pearl Harbor",
