  "(c) Pan-Africanism",
  "Early in the twentieth century there was an important development in African thinking",
  "which emphasized that all people of African descent, wherever they lived, were united by",
  "the same cultural and spiritual heritage. Pan-Africanism, as it became known, was first",
  "publicized by people of African origin living outside Africa. At the forefront were Marcus",
  "Garvey, a self-educated Jamaican who had founded the Universal Negro Improvement",
  "Association, and W. E. B. Du Bois, the first African American to earn a doctorate from",
  "Harvard. Gradually these ideas spread and by the end of the Second World War some",
  "African students, mainly from British colonies, had taken up pan-Africanism. Not only",
  "was it an encouragement to theirambitionsof independence, it also inspired them to think",
  ".",
  "beyond that If all Africans shared the same social and cultural ties, it meant that the ulti",
  "\u00ac",
  "mate goal after independence must be to abandon the artificial frontiers set up by the",
  "Europeans and have a sort of federal United States of Africa along the same lines as the",
  ".",
  "United States of America",
  "-",
  "Kwame Nkrumah, who was to become the first prime minister of a semi independent",
  "- .",
  "Gold Coast and then thefirst president of Ghana, wasastrong believer in pan Africanism",
  "He wasted no time before organizing meetings and conferences of African leaders in",
  ".",
  "which he pressed the advantages of African unification Some states supported the idea,",
  "including Guinea,Mali and Morocco, but a majority were not impressed-having just won",
  "their independence, they saw little point in surrendering a large proportion of it by enter",
  "\u00ac",
  "ing a huge political federation. Some of the other leaders suspected that Nkrumah was",
  "developing delusions of grandeur, seeing himself as the president of a federal Africa.",
  "Strongest in their opposition were Ethiopia and Liberia, which had been independent for",
  "generations, together with Nigeria, Sierra Leone and almost all the former French",
  "colonies. By 1963 the prospect of a United States of Africa had disappeared when a",
  "conference of African countries at Addis Ababa (Ethiopia) decided that the best way",
  "forward would be for them all to join an Organization of African Unity (OAU), a much",
  ".",
  "less binding arrangement, whilestilldisplaying asortof unity But pan-Africanism had not",
  "been totally irrelevant-it had been an important influence on the rise of nationalist move",
  "ments in many of the former colonies. \u00ac",
  "(d) Outside pressures",
  "There were several outside pressures on the colonial powers to give up their empires. The",
  "USA, no doubt remembering that they had been the earliest part of the British Empire to",
  "declare independence (1776), was hostile to imperialism (building up empiresand owning",
  ".",
  "colonies) During the war, President Roosevelt made it clear that he took the Atlantic",
  "Charter to apply to all peoples, not just those taken over by the Germans. He and his",
  "successor, Truman, pressurized the British government to speed up independence for",
  "India. Peter Clarke points out that Churchill\u2019s imperialism irritated the Americans to such",
  "an extent that they were determined not to do anything that would help Britain to keep its",
  "THEENDOFTHEEUROPEAN EMPIRES 533.",
  "empire One reason given by the Americans for wanting to see the end of the European",
  "empires was that delaysin granting independence to European colonies in Asia and Africa",
  "would encourage the development of communism in those areas. While there was clearly",
  "some truth in this argument in the case of Asia, Bernard Porter was convinced that in the",
  "case of Africa, there was still comparatively little communist influence. More important",
  "was the fact that the Americans looked on the newly-independent nations as potential",
  "markets into which they could force their way and establish both economic and political",
  "influence. In the eyes of the USA, imperially protected markets gave the British and other",

  "24.2 INDIAN INDEPENDENCE AND PARTITION",
  "(a) Background to independence",
  "The British had made some concessions to the Indian nationalists even before the Second",
  ".",
  "World War The Morley-Minto reforms (1909), the Montague-Chelmsford reforms",
  "(1919) and the Government of India Act (1935) all gave the Indians more say in the",
  ".",
  "governmentof their country The Indians were also promised \u2018dominion status\u2019 assoon as",
  "the war was over.This meant becoming more or lesscompletely independent, though still",
  ".",
  "acknowledging the British monarch as head of state, like Australia The Labour govern",
  "\u00ac",
  "ment, newly elected in 1945, wanted to show that it disapproved of exploiting the Indians",
  "and was anxious to press ahead with independence,on both moral and economic grounds.",
  "Ernest Bevin, the foreign secretary, had earlier toyed with the idea of delaying indepen",
  "\u00ac",
  "dence for a few years to enable Britain to finance a development programme for India.",
  "This idea was dropped because the Indians would be suspiciousof any delay,and because",
  "Britain could not afford the expense, given its own economic difficulties. Bevin and",
  "Clement Attlee, the prime minister, therefore decided to give India full independence,",
  ".",
  "allowing the Indians to work out the details for themselves",
  "The reasons why the British decided to grant Indian independence have been the",
  ".",
  "subject of lively debate Official sources presented it as the culmination of a process going",
  "back to the Government of India Act of 1919 -a process by which the British carefully",
  "prepared India for independence. Some Indian historians, including Sumit Sarkar and",
  "Anita InderSingh,have challenged this view,arguing that Indian independence was never",
  "a long-term goal of the British and that the Government of India Acts of 1919 and 1935",
  ".",
  "were designed not to prepare the way for independence but to postpone it Independence",
  "was not a gift from the British,it was \u2018the hard-won fruit of struggle and sacrifice\u2019. Other",
  "historians have suggested that India was no longer of any value to Britain: instead of being",
  "asource of profit,it was now adrain on British resources. The aim of the government was",
  "therefore to get out of India in a way that did not look too much like a humiliation, and",
  ".",
  "that kept India within the British financial network and Commonwealth",
  "Some writers have taken a middle view. Howard Brasted defended the Labour govern",
  "\u00ac",
  "ment against accusations that it made its policy up as it went along, and ended up running",
  "away from the problem. He showed that the Labour Party had drawn up a clear policy of",
  "withdrawal from India before the Second World War,and this was discussed by the party",
  "534",
  "PARTY DECOLONIZATION ANDAFTER.",
  "leader,Clement Attlee,and Jawaharlal Nehru, the Indian Congress leader,in 1938 Nehru",
  "and Gandhi knew that when Labour won the election of July 1945, Indian independence",
  "could not be far away. Sadly the progress towards independence turned out to be far more",
  "difficult than had been expected: the problems were so complex that the country ended up",
  "having to be divided into two states-India and Pakistan.",
  "(b) Why was the partition of India necessary?",
  "1 Religious hostility between Hindus and Muslims",
  "This was the main problem. Hindus made up about two-thirds of the 400 million popula",
  "\u00ac",
  "tion, and the rest were mostly Muslims. After their victories in the 1937 elections when",
  "they won eight out of the eleven states, the Hindu National Congress Party unwisely",
  "called on the Muslim League to merge with Congress. This alarmed the Muslim League,",
  "who were afraid that an independent India would be dominated by Hindus. The Muslim",
  "leader, M.A. Jinnah,demanded a separate Muslim state of Pakistan,and adopted as his",
  ".",
  "slogan \u2018Pakistan or Perish\u2019",
  "2 Compromise attempts failed",
  ".",
  "Attempts todraw upacompromise solutionacceptable to bothHindusand Muslimsfailed",
  "The British proposed a federal scheme in which the central government would have only",
  ".",
  "limited powers, while those of the provincial governments would be much greater This",
  "would enable provinces with a Muslim majority to control their own affairs and there",
  ".",
  "would be no need for a separate state Both sides accepted the idea in principle but failed",
  ".",
  "to agree on the details",
  "3 Violence broke out in August 1946",
  "This began when the viceroy (the king\u2019s representative in India), Lord Wavell,invited the",
  "Congress leader, Jawaharlal Nehru, to form an interim government, still hoping that",
  ".",
  "details could be worked out later Nehru formed a cabinet which included two Muslims,",
  "but Jinnah was convinced that the Hindus could not be trusted to treat the Muslims fairly.",
  "He called for a day of \u2018direct action\u2019 in support of a separate Pakistan. Fierce rioting",
  "followed in Calcutta, where 5000 people were killed, and it soon spread to Bengal, where",
  "Muslims set about slaughtering Hindus. As Hindus retaliated, the country seemed on the",

  "verge of civil war",

  "The British government, realizing that they lacked the military strength to control the situ",

  "\u00ac",

  "by Nehru and Jinnah, although M K Gandhi,known as the Mahatma (Great Soul), the",

  "India to become the independent state of Pakistan. The new Pakistan unfortunately",
  "consisted of two separate areasovera thousand milesapart (see Map 24.1). Independence",
  "day for both India and Pakistan was 15 August 1947. Problems followed immediately:",

  "mixed Hindu/Muslim populations This meant that millions of people found them",

  "2 Afraidofbeing attacked,millionsofpeopleheadedforthefrontiers,Muslimstrying",

  "near-hysterical mob violence,especially in the Punjab, whereabout 250000people",

  "still preaching non-violence and toleration, managed tocalm the situation.",
  "Gandhi",
  "3 Violence began to die down before the end of 1947, but in January 1948",

  "536 PARTV DECOLONIZATION AND AFTER",

  "the granting of independence to India and Pakistan was an act of far sighted states",
  ". \u00ac",
  "manship Attlee argued, with some justification, that Britain could not be blamed",
  "for the violence; this was due, he said, \u2018to the failure of the Indians to agree among",
  "themselves\u2019. V. P. Menon, a distinguished Indian political observer, believed that",
  "Britain\u2019s decision to leave India \u2018not only touched the hearts and stirred the",
  "emotions of India ... it earned for Britain universal respect and goodwill\u2019. Howard",
  "Brasted agreed, pointing out that a less sensitive handling of the situation by the",
  "British government could have produced an even more catastrophic bloodbath. On",
  "the other hand, A. N. Wilson believes that there could have been less violence if",
  "Mountbatten had acted differently.Heshould have provided peacekeepingforces to",
  "protect the migrant populations,and he should have taken more care in deciding the",
  "frontiers.Wilson writes,perhapsa trifle unfairly: \u2018By his superficial haste, hissheer",
  "arrogance and his inattention to vital detail ... Mountbatten was responsible for as",
  "many deaths as some of those who were hanged after the Nuremberg trials.\u2019",

  "Although some states, particularly Britain (with the exception of Kenya), handled decolo",

  "there was no simple happy ending. There were some gains for the new states, which now",
  "had muchmorecontrolover what wenton inside theirfrontiers;and there weresomegains",
  "for ordinary people, such as advances in education and social services, and a political",
  "culture which allowed them to vote. However, it soon became fashionable to dismiss the",
  "entire colonial and imperial experience as a disaster, in which European nations, with",
  "supreme arrogance, imposed control over their subject peoples, exploited them ruthlessly",
  ".",
  "and then withdrew unwillingly, leaving them impoverished and facing new problems",
  "Piers Brendon pointsout that this was not really surprising,since \u2018the British Empire\u2019s real",
  "purpose was not to spread sweetness and light but to increase Britain\u2019s wealth and power.",
  "Naturally its coercive and exploitative nature must be disguised.\u2019 The same applied to",

  ".",
  "There is plenty of evidence to support this negative view of colonialism Although by",
  "no means all officials were racist bullies, there is no doubt that most of them treated the",
  "native peoples with arrogance, and considered them to be inferior beings or lesser breeds.",
  "After the Indian Mutiny of 1857, the army vowed to spill \u2018barrels and barrels of the filth",
  "that flows in these niggers\u2019 veins for every drop of blood\u2019 that they had shed. Piers",
  "Brendon shows that \u2018the history of India is punctuated by famines which caused tens of",
  "millions of deaths\u2019. During a severe famine in Bengal in 1942-3, Churchill refused to",
  "divert shipping to take food supplies to Calcutta. The result -over 3 million people died",

  "just for the benefit of the ruling power It sought to globalize not just an economic but a",
