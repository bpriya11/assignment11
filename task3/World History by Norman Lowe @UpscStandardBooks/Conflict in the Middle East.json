  "SUMMARY OF EVENTS",
  "The area known as the Middle East has been one of the world\u2019s most troubled regions,",
  "especially since 1945. Wars and civil wars have raged almost non-stop, and there has",
  "hardly been a time when the whole region was at peace. The Middle East consists of",
  "Egypt, the Sudan, Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Iran, Turkey, the",

  "The creation of Israel in Palestine,an area belonging to the Palestinian Arabs,outraged",
  "Arab opinion throughout the world (other Arab states outside the Middle East are",
  "Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia and Libya). The Arabs especially blamed Britain, who, they",
  "felt, had been more sympathetic to the Jews than to the Arabs; most of all they blamed the",
  "USA, which had supported the idea of a Jewish state very strongly. The Arab states",
  "refused to recognize Israel as a legal state and they vowed to destroy it. Although there",
  "were four short wars between Israel and the various Arab states (1948-9, 1956, 1967 and",
  "1973), Arab attacks failed, and Israel survived. However, the conflict between Israel and",
  "the Palestinians dragged on;even at the end of the first decade of the twenty-first century,",
  "no permanent peace agreement had been reached.",
  "The Arab desire to destroy Israel tended for much of the time to overshadow all other",
  "concerns. However, two other themes ran through Middle East affairs which became",
  "mixed up with the anti-Israel struggle:",
  "(cid:127) the desire of some Arabs to achieve political and economic unity among the Arab",

  "They all speak the Arabic language, they are nearly all Muslims (followers of the religion",

  "(a) Why did the creation of the state of Israel lead to war?",
  "1 The origin of the problem went back almost 2000 years to the year AD 71, when",

  ".",
  "the Romans In fact,small communitiesof Jewsstayed behind in Palestine,andover",
  "the following 1700 years there was a gradual trickle of Jews returning from exile.",
  "Until the end of the nineteenth century, however, there were never enough Jews to",
  "make the Arabs, who now looked on Palestine as their homeland, feel threatened.",
  "2 In 1897 some Jews living in Europe founded the World Zionist Organization at",
  "Basle in Switzerland.Zionists were people who believed that Jews ought to be able",
  "to go back to Palestine and have what they called \u2018a national homeland\u2019; in other",
  "words,a Jewish state.Jews had recently suffered persecution in Russia, France and",
  "Germany,and a Jewish state would provide a safe refugefor Jewsfrom allover the",
  "world. The problem was that Palestine was inhabited by Arabs who were under",
  "\u00ac",
  "standably alarmed at the prospect of losing their land to the Jews.",
  "3 Britain became involved in 1917, when the foreign minister, Arthur Balfour,",

  "After 1919, when Palestine becamea British mandate,large numbersof Jews began",

  "(a) Why did the two sides begin to talk to each other?",

  "and that it was foolish to keep on wasting Egypt\u2019s resources in fruitless wars; but it",
  "took great courage to be the first Arab leader to meet the Israelisface to face. Even",

  "states, Iraq and Syria, would bitterly resent any approach. In spite of the dangers,",
  "Sadat offered to go to Israel and talk to the Knesset (Israeli parliament).",
  "2 The Israelis were suffering economic problems, partly because of their enormous",
  "defence expenditure, and partly because of a world recession. The USA was press",

  "depots; a week later ground troops invaded the territory After 22 days the Israelis called",

  "a ceasefire But damage from the aerial bombardment was indiscriminate and disastrous:",
  "15 out of 27 hospitals were put out of action or destroyed, together with schools, police",

  "stations, mosques,factories and Hamas government buildings About 10 000 small family",
  "farms were destroyed, which badly disrupted food supplies over the next few months. Out",

  "Palestinians were killed and about 5000 injured;50 000 were left homeless, half a million",
  "had no running water and a million were left without electricity. Much of the Gaza Strip",
  "was left in ruins. On the other side, 13 Israelis were killed. Amnesty International later",

  "an end to suicide bombings and rocket fire when it decided to join the Palestinian politi",

  "cal process, and largely stuck to it for more than a year.\u2019",
  "The Israelis blithely ignored the mounting international criticism flooding in from most",
  "parts of the world (except from the USA), calling on them to ease or lift the blockade. In",
  "July 2010 British prime ministerDavid Cameron warned: \u2018humanitarian goodsand people",

  "must flow in both directions Gaza cannot and must not be allowed to remain a prison",

  "\u00ac",
  "oners of the terrorist organisation Hamas. The situation in Gaza is the direct result of",
  ".",
  "Hamas rules and priorities\u2019 Eventually it was Egypt which relented and partially opened",
  "itsfrontier with Gaza,but only for people, not supplies. In February 2011 the UN reported",
  "that Israel had co-operated to some extent between January 2009 and June 2010 by allow",
  "\u00ac",
  "ing fuel and cooking gas into Gaza, but added that this had not resulted in any significant",
  "improvement in people\u2019s livelihoods.",
  "Then in May 2011 there was a dramatic change in the situation: following months of",
  "protest demonstrations and increasing violence, President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt",
  "resigned (see Section 12.7(c)). Not long before this, US president Obama had described",
  "...",
  "him as \u2018a stalwart ally, in many respects, to the United States a force for stability and",
  "good\u2019 in the Middle East. Yet many people had viewed Mubarak as one of the most brutal",

  "dictators in the region One of his main opponents was the Muslim Brotherhood, who had",
  "close associations with Hamas. Egypt immediately opened its border with Gaza",
  "completely. There was great rejoicing as the people of Gaza began to look forward to",
  "better times ahead. But this was somewhat premature: in November 2012 Israel launched",
  "a series of airattacks on Gaza,claiming that theiraction was in retaliation for hundreds of",
  "rockets recently fired from Gaza into Israel. Lasting for eight days, the Israeli attacks",
  "killed over 160 Palestinians, including many children,and destroyed several military sites",
  "in Gaza. Five Israelis were killed. Egypt\u2019s president, Mohamed Morsi, helped to broker a",
  "ceasefire. Both sides claimed victory, but there was still no commitment by Israel to end",
  "their blockade of Gaza. Until that point was reached, it seemed likely that Hamas would",

  "on one side, and France and Russia (who opposed a war) on the other. The resolution did",
  "not give the USA full authority to attack Iraq, but it clearly sent a strong message to",
  "Saddam as to what he might expect if he failed to comply. The Security Council would",

  "that although he would be happy witha second resolution,he did not consider it necessary;",
  "he argued that Resolution 1441 already gave the USA authority to attack Saddam. The",
  "USA, UK and Spain pressed for another resolution, while France, Russia and China were",

  ".",
  "they had done once before in 1953 In November 1979 a party of radical Khomeini",
  "supporters attacked the American embassy in Tehran and took 66 Americans hostage.",
  "Most of them were not released until early in 1981, after long negotiations and a failed",
  "rescue attempt in which eight Americans were killed and six helicopters lost. The two",
  "main characteristicsof Islamic government,at least in Khomeini\u2019s view, were the primacy",
  "of divine law over all citizens, and the principle of democracy. However, in practice this",
  "meant that Khomeini acted as an autocratic ruler and became the symbol of opposition to",
  "the less desirable aspects of Western civilization and culture. Unfortunately most of",
  "Khomeini\u2019s time in power was dominated by the war with Iraq (see Section 11.9), which",
  "lasted from 1980 until 1989. At the end of it Iran was in a sorry state: the economy was in",
  "ruins, vital revenue from oil sales had been lost, much of industry had been put out of",
  "action and inflation was running at over 30 per cent. Khomeini died in 1989, before the",
  "attack on Iraq and the downfall of Saddam Hussein in 1991.",
  "The new president, Ali Akbar Rafsanjani, was able to take some advantage from this",
  "war. It meant that Iraq was removed from the political equation of the region for the time",
  "being, and it enabled Iran to rebuild and recover from the destruction of the earlier war.",
  "He won in the 1992 elections and shared power with the religious leader, Ayatollah Ali",
  "Khamenei. The economy gradually recovered, there were great improvements in public",
  "services,education and literacy and the governmentdid its best toencourage birth control.",

  "possess nuclear armaments, so Iran needed them to act as a deterrent.",
  "The 1997 presidential election was won by Muhammad Khatami, a more moderate",
  "leader than Rafsanjani; Khatami was in favour of liberalization and reform. He brought a",

  "(AEOI) was founded. The Shah insisted that the nuclear programme was for entirely",
  "peaceful purposes, and Iran signed the Non-Proliferation Treaties (NPT) which said that",
  "countries which already had nuclear weapons (the USA, the USSR, China, France and",
  "Britain) could keep them, but no other country could join. In return they would supply",
  "peaceful economic technology and would themselves move towards disarmament. The",

  "shortages and the government was forced to announce a U-turn. But the situation had",
  "changed: following the kidnappings at the American embassy in Tehran in November",
  "1979, the USA imposed economic and military sanctions on Iraq and put pressure on the",
  "International Atomic Energy Association (IAEA) not to get involved with Iran. In 1988",
  "Ali Akbar Rafsanjani, who at that point was chairman of the Iranian parliament, appealed",
  "to Iranian scientists working abroad to come home-it was their patriotic duty to work on",

  "the nuclear programme The government continued to insist publicly that it had no plans",
  "to acquire nuclear weapons.",
  "Nevertheless,asDavid Patrikarakospointsout (in NuclearIran:The Birthof anAtomic",

  "Iran certainly had reason to want a bomb. It was extremely unpopular with one of the",

  "silenceabout Iraq\u2019s invasion and itssubsequent useof chemical weapons,as well as the",

  "about this time",
  "He goes on to explain that during the 1990s the nuclear programme began to concentrate",
  "on uranium enrichment and plutonium production, both classic ways of making a bomb.",
  "The government also resolved that by 2005, at least 20 per cent of Iran\u2019s energy should",
  "come from nuclear power. In 1990 Iran signed nuclear co-operation agreements with",
  "Russia and China. By 2000 the AEOI was secretly well under way with its uranium-",

  "and Germany, encouraged by the USA, demanded that Iran should give up uranium",

  "In fact,although support for the nuclear programme was more or less universal in Iran,",
  "there were disagreements over whether it should concentrate on producing bombs or",
  "whether the priority should be the production of electricity. During the 2009 election",
  "campaign there was criticism of Ahmadinejad\u2019s deliberately confrontational style which,",
  "it was felt, only further antagonized the West. Although he won the election, possibly",
  "fraudulently, many observers felt that he had become isolated and diminished. According",
  "to the IAEA, at the end of 2011 Iran had enough uranium at the Natanz site to make four",
  "nuclear bombs, but it admitted that there was no definite proof that they had actually",
  "produced a bomb. The Iranians insisted that the enriched uranium was intended for",
  "medical isotopes. By February 2012 the IAEA\u2019s tone had changed. An inspection in",

  "According to some observers,contrary to what western political leaders claimed, there",

  "Roberts (who was director of the International Crisis Group\u2019s North Africa Project from",
  "2002 until 2007, and again during the Libyan civil war in 2011) explains how, on 10",

  "March 2011,the International CrisisGroup (ICG) putforward a plan fora settlement This",
  "involved setting up a contact group made up of representativesfrom Libya\u2019s neighbouring",

  "the Security Council voted to take \u2018all necessary measures\u2019 to protect civilians In the",

  "By inserting \u2018all necessary measures\u2019 into the resolution, London, Paris and",
  "Washington licensed themselves, with NATO as their proxy, to do whatever they",
  "wanted whenever they wanted in the full knowledge that they would never be held to",
  "-",
  "account, since as permanent veto holding members of the Security Council, they are",
  ".",
  "above all laws",
  "However, the resolution did also demand a ceasefire and an end to all attackson civilians,",
  "as a prelude to negotiations. Gaddafi, whose forces at that point were on the outskirts of",
  "THENEW WORLDORDER ANDTHEWAR AGAINSTGLOBALTERRORISM 289.",
  "Benghazi, immediately announced a ceasefire and proposed a dialogue As Hugh Roberts",
  "put it: \u2018what the Security Council demanded and suggested, he provided in a matter of",
  "hours\u2019. The offer was immediately rejected by one of the senior rebel commanders,",
  "Khalifa Haftar,on the grounds that Gaddafi could not be trusted, and the Western powers",
  ".",
  "simply accepted this A week later Turkey announced that it had held talks with both sides",
  "and offered to help negotiatea ceasefire.Gaddafi once again agreed, but the NTC rejected",
  "the offer and demanded the resignation of Gaddafi before they would agree to a ceasefire.",
  "Gaddafi offered to call a ceasefire three more times-in April, May and June-and each",
  ".",
  "time the offer was rejected No pressure was brought on the NTC, no doubt because the",
  "mission of the Western powers was regime change.",
  "Even before Gaddafi was so unceremoniously killed, there were disturbing signs for",
  "the West that genuine democracy might not be the outcome of the civil war after all.",
  "When Gaddafi claimed thatal-Qaeda was involved in the uprising, he was probably exag",
  "\u00ac",
  "gerating. But in fact the revolution did stir up and mobilize the Islamists. For example,",
  "when the NTC chairman, Mustafa Abdul Jalil, made his first trip from Benghazi to",
  "Tripoli, he announced that all legislation of the future NTC government would be based",
  "on the Islamic Sharia law.The newly appointed military commander of Tripoli was none",

  "other than Abdul Hakim Belhadj, a former leader of the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group",
  "Thisextremist group had waged a terrorist campaign againstGaddafi and the Libyanstate",
  "throughout the 1990s and had provided hundreds of recruits for al-Qaeda. The worry for",
  "genuine Libyan democrats and for the West, once the war was over, was that the various",
  "factions and militias that had combined to overthrow the Gaddafi regime now battled",
  ".",
  "among themselvesforcontrol By December 2011 the Libyan nationalarmy,commanded",
  "by Gaddafi\u2019s former generals, was finding it very difficult to disarm the militias, each of",
  "which controlled its own area. The militias were intensely suspicious of the intentions of",
  "the NTC, which was dominated by people from the east of the country. The NTC was",
  "acting secretively: although acabinet had been appointed, nobody knew who its members",
  ".",
  "were and its meetings were held in secret When it was announced that the oil and",
  "-",
  "economic ministries were being moved from Tripoli to Benghazi, there were anti NTC",
  "protests across the country. In the background there was the possibility of an Islamist",
  "resurgence, with the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group setting up a Taliban-style govern",
  "\u00ac",
  "ment. There was a long way to go before the Libyan people would be able to enjoy real",
  "democracy. However, during the first half of 2012 the situation became calmer, and the",
  "first elections for over 40 years were able to take place in July 2012. These passed off",
  "reasonably peacefully, except in the east where supporters of a federal state were",
  "demanding more seats in the national congress. Against expectations, the moderate",
  "National Forces Alliance won a comfortable victory,and its leader, Mahmoud Jibril, who",
  "had acted as interim prime minister for a time, became president. This was in marked",
  "contrast to what had happened in Tunisia and Egypt, where Islamists gained control.",
  "Mahmoud Jibril said he wanted to work with all parties in a grand coalition and rejected",
  "claimsfrom some clerics that his party was toosecularfor the Islamists to work with.The",
  "next step was to prepare for parliamentary elections in 2013, and in the meantime the",
  "Jibril government concentrated on gaining control of the various militias still operating",
  ".",
  "outside the law",
  "The difficulties involved in this task were clearly illustrated on 11September 2012, the",
  "anniversary of the al-Qaeda attacks on the USA. A gang attacked the American consulate",
  "in Benghazi with guns and grenades, killing four Americans, including Chris Stevens, the",
  "American ambassador, who happened to beon a visit from Tripoli.It was believed that the",
  "attack was triggered by the showing on YouTube of the trailer foran American film called",
  "The Innocence of Muslims, which was extremely insulting to the prophet Muhammad.",
