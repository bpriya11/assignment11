  "noquick compromisecould be reached,and the talks wenton foranotherfive years.",
  "3 Richard Nixon (1969-74) realized that a new approach was needed, since public",

  "(a) How did Allende come to be elected?",
  "Chile, unlike most other South American states, had a tradition of democracy. There were",
  "three main parties or groups of parties:",

  "(cid:127) the Christian Democrats (also left-inclined);",

  "The army played little part in politics, and the democratic constitution (similar to that of",

  "usually respected. The election of 1964 was won by Eduardo Frei, leader of the Christian",

  "importantexport), whereas the right thought he hadalreadygone toofar. In 1969 there was",

  "more and thereby stimulate the economy. All-round wage increases of about 40 per cent",
  "were introduced and firms were not allowed to increase prices. The remainder of the",

  "each other, for the leadership of world communism To complicate matters further,",
  "Vietnam now supported Russia. When the Chinese attacked Vietnam (February 1979),",

  "(See Sections 10.6 and 18.3for the reasons behind the collapse of communism in eastern",
  ".",
  "Europe )",
  "(b) How were international relations affected?",
  "Many people in the west thought that with the collapse of communism in eastern Europe,",
  ".",
  "the world\u2019s problems would miraculously disappear But nothing could have been further",
  "from the truth and a range of new problems surfaced.",
  "1 The Cold War was over",
  "The most immediate result was that theformer USSR and itsallies were no longer seen by",
  "the West as the \u2018enemy\u2019. In November 1990 the countries of NATO and the Warsaw Pact",
  "signed a treaty agreeing that they were \u2018no longer adversaries\u2019, and that none of their",
  "weapons would ever be used except in self-defence. The Cold War was over, and",
  "Gorbachev must take much of the credit for bringing it to an end. His determination to",
  "workfordisarmament broke thestalemate and impressed Reagan, whoalsodeserves much",
  "credit for responding so positively to Gorbachev\u2019s initiatives. The end of the Cold War",
  "was an enormous step forward. However ...",
  "2 New conflicts soon arose",
  "These were often caused by nationalism. During the Cold War, the USSR and the USA,",
  "as we haveseen,kept tightcontrol, by force if necessary,overareas where their vitalinter",
  ". \u00ac",
  "ests might be affected Now, a conflict which did not directly affect the interests of East",
  "or West would probably be left to find itsown solution, bloody orotherwise. Nationalism,",
  "which had been suppressed by communism, soon re-emerged in some of the former states",
  ".",
  "of the USSR and elsewhere Sometimes disputes were settled peacefully, for example in",
  "Czechoslovakia, where Slovak nationalists insisted on breaking away to form a separate",
  ".",
  "state of Slovakia However, war broke out between Azerbaijan and Armenia (two former",
  ".",
  "republics of the USSR) over disputed territory There was fighting in Georgia (another",
  ".",
  "former Soviet republic) where the people of the north wanted to form a separate state",
  "Most tragic of all was Yugoslavia, which broke up into five separate states - Serbia",
  "(with Montenegro), Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia, Slovenia and Macedonia. Soon a",
  "complex civil war broke out in which Serbia tried to grab as much territory as possible",
  "from Croatia. In Bosnia,Serbs, Croats and Muslims fought each other in an attempt to set",
  "up states of their own. This increasingly bitter struggle dragged on for almost four years",
  "164 PART I WAR ANDINTERNATIONAL RELATIONS.",
  "untila ceasefire wasarranged in November 1995 (seeSection 10.7) So at a time when the",

  ".",
  "units",
  "3 Supervision of nuclear weapons",
  "Another fear, now that the Russians and the USA were less willing to act as \u2018policemen\u2019,",
  "was that countries with what the powers considered to be unstable or irresponsible",
  "governments might use nuclear weapons - countries like, for example, Iraq, Iran and",
  "Libya. One of the needs of the 1990s therefore, was better international supervision and",
  "control of nuclear weapons, and also of biological and chemical weapons.",
  "4 Economic problems",
  "All the former communist states faced another problem -how to deal with the economic",
  "collapse and intense poverty left over from the communist \u2018command\u2019 economies, and",
  "how to change to \u2018free-market\u2019 economies.They needed a carefully planned and generous",

  "backlash,especially in Russiaitself, whichcould be justas threatening ascommunism was",
  "once thought to be.There wasclearly causeforconcern,given the large number of nuclear",
  ".",
  "weapons still in existence in the region There was the danger that Russia, desperate to",
  "raise money, might sell off some of its nuclear weapons to \u2018unsuitable\u2019 governments.",

  "The Poles were very suspicious of a united and powerful Germany, fearing that it might",
  "try to take back the former German territory east of the rivers Oder and Neisse, given to",

  "Poland after theSecond World War Germany alsofound itself providing refugefor people",

  "The disappearance of communism affected relations between the western allies, the USA,",
  "western Europe and Japan. They had been held together by the need to stand firm against",
  "communism, but now differencesemergedover trade and the extent to which the USA and",

  "war in Bosnia, relations between the USA and the states of western Europe became",
  "strained when the USA refused to provide troops for the UN peacekeeping forces, leaving",
