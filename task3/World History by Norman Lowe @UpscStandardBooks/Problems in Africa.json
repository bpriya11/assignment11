  "Kwame Nkrumah ruled Ghana from the time the country gained independence in 1957",

  "(a) His initial achievements were impressive",
  "He was a socialist in outlook and wanted his people to enjoy a higher standard of living,",

  "Nkrumah also gained prestige internationally: he strongly supported the pan African",
  "movement, believing that only through a federation of the whole continent could African",
  ".",
  "power make itself felt As a start, an economic union was formed with Guinea and Mali,",
  "though nothing much came of it, while hisdream of an African federal state quickly faded",
  "(seeSection 24.1(c)).He supported theOrganizationof AfricanUnity(set up in 1963),and",
  "usually played a responsible role in world affairs, keeping Ghana in the Commonwealth;",
  "in 1961 Queen Elizabeth II made a state visit to Ghana. At the same time Nkrumah forged",
  ".",
  "links with the USSR, East Germany and China",
  "(b) Why was Nkrumah overthrown?",
  "He tried to introduce industrialization too quickly and borrowed vast amounts of capital",
  "from abroad, hoping to balance the budget from increased exports. Unfortunately Ghana",
  "was still uncomfortably dependent on cocoa exports, and a steep fall in the world price of",
  "cocoa left her with a huge balance-of-payments deficit. The smelting plant was a disap",
  "\u00ac",
  "pointment because the American corporation that built and owned it insisted on buying",
  "bauxite from abroad instead of using Ghanaian bauxite. There was criticism that too much",
  "money was being wasted on unnecessary projects, like the ten-mile stretch of motorway",
  "from Accra (the capital) to Tema, and some grandiose building projects.",
  "Probably the most important reason for his downfall was that he gradually began to",
  "abandon parliamentary government in favour of a one-party state and personal dictator",
  ". \u00ac",
  "ship He justified this on the grounds that the opposition parties, which were based on",
  "tribaldifferences, werenotconstructive and merely wanted more powerin their own areas.",
  "They had no experience of working a parliamentary system, and as Nkrumah himself",
  "wrote: \u2018Even a system based on a democratic constitution may need backing up in the",
  "period following independence by emergency measures of a totalitarian kind.\u2019",
  "From 1959 onwards, opponents could be deported or imprisoned for up to five years",
  "without trial. Even the respected opposition leader,J. B. Danqua, was arrested in 1961 and",
  "died in prison.In 1964all partiesexcept Nkrumah\u2019s were banned,andeven within hisown",
  "party no criticism was allowed. He began to build up the image of himself as the \u2018father",

  "PROBLEMS IN AFRICA 565better with asingle personality as leader than with vague notionsof the state. All this, plus",
  "the fact that he was believed to have amassed a personal fortune through corruption, was",
  "too much for the army, which seized control when Nkrumah was on a visit to China",
  "(1966). The American CIA gave the coup its full backing, because the USA disapproved",

  "of Nkrumah\u2019s links with communist states",

  "ation. In power in the first place only by permission of the army, he had to produce quick",
  ".",
  "results Yet the problems were enormous - rising unemployment, rising prices, the low",
  "price of cocoa on the world market, and massive debts to be repaid. Canada and the USA",
  "were prepared to wait for repayment, but other countries, including Britain, were not so",

  "Reluctantly Rawlings turned to the IMF for help, and though he had to agree to their",

  "seemed to be working. Production rose by 7 per cent, and early in 1985 inflation was",
  "down to 40 per cent. As Ghana celebrated 30 years of independence (March 1987), she",
  "was still on course for recovery, and Rawlings and his party, the National Democratic",
  "Congress (NDC),evoking memoriesof Nkrumah, were running an apparently successful",
  "campaign to unite the 12 million Ghanaians solidly behind them. In the early 1990s",
  "Ghana was enjoying one of the highest economic growth rates in Africa. Yet for many",
  "people ther.e remained one big criticism: there was no progress towards representative",

  "but Kufuorscored a surprise victory and took overas president in January 2001.The NDC",
  "defeat was probably caused by economic problems- there had been a fall in the world",

  "J PROBLEMSIN AFRICA 567(cid:127)",
  "Nigeria\u2019s tribal differences were more serious than Ghana\u2019s, and although the",
  "constitution was a federal one, in which each of the three regions (north, east and",
  "west) had its own local government, the regions felt that the central government in",
  "Lagos did not safeguard their interests sufficiently. Balewa came from the Muslim",

  "the Ibos of the south and east were constantly complaining about northern domina",
  "\u00ac",

  "(cid:127) To make matters worse there was an economic recession. By 1964 prices had risen",
  "by 15 per cent, unemployment was rising and wages were, on average, well below",
  "what had been calculated as the minimum living wage.Criticism of the government",

  "(c) Recovery after the war was remarkably swift",

  "There were pressing problems: famine in Biafra, inter tribal bitterness, unemployment,",

  ". -",
  "in thisdifficult situation There was no revenge taking,as the Ibos had feared,and Gowon",
  "made every effort to reconcile them, persuading them to return to their jobs in other parts",
  "of the country. He introduced a new federal system of 12 states, later increased to 19, to",
  "give more recognition of local tribal differences; this was a pragmatic move in a country",

  "Unfortunately disappointment was soon tofollow:during 1981 theeconomy got into diffi",
  "\u00ac",
  "culties. The Nigerians had relied too heavily on oil exports; there was a fall in world oil",
  "prices, and the healthy trade balance of 1980 became a deficit in 1983. Although Shagari",
  "was elected for another four-year term (August 1983), he was removed by a military coup",
  "the following December. According to the new leader, Major-General Bukhari, the civil",

  "The new president, Major-General Babangida, began energetically, introducing what",

  "of coffee and cotton doubled and sugar production trebled, while health services and",
  "education expanded. But Nyerere was not happy that Tanzania seemed to be developing",

  "(a) An impressive beginning, 1980-90",
  "Robert Mugabe, prime minister of the newly independent Zimbabwe, had been an",
  ".",
  "uncompromising guerrilla leader with Marxist opinions He soon showed that he was",
  ".",
  "capable of moderation, and pledged himself to work for reconciliation and unity This",
  "calmed the fears of the white farmers and businessmen who had remained in Zimbabwe",
  "and who were necessary for the economy to flourish. He formed a coalition government",
  "between his party, the Zimbabwe African National Union (ZANU), whose main support",
  "came from the Shona people, and Joshua Nkomo\u2019s Zimbabwe African People\u2019s Union",
  "(ZAPU),supported by the Ndebele people in Matabeleland. He kept his promise made at",
  "the Lancaster House Conference (see Section 24.4(c)) that the whites should have 20",
  "guaranteed seats in the 100-seat parliament. Measures were introduced to alleviate the",
  "poverty of the black population - wage increases, food subsidies and better social",
  "services, health care and education. Many commentators felt that in hisfirst few years in",
  "power, Mugabe showed great statesmanship and deserved credit for keeping his country",
  ".",
  "relatively peaceful",
  "Nevertheless there were problems to be dealt with. The most serious in the early years",
  "was the long-standing hostility between ZANU and ZAPU. The Shona people of ZANU",
  "felt that ZAPU could have done more to help during the struggle for black majority rule.",
  "The coalition between Mugabe and Nkomo was uneasy,and in 1982 Nkomo was accused",
  "of planningacoup.Mugabeforced him toresignand had many leading membersof ZAPU",
  "arrested. Nkomo\u2019s supporters in Matabeleland retaliated with violence, but were brutally",

  "power-sharing scheme;",
  "(cid:127) reserved seats for whites in parliament were abolished.",
  "PROBLEMS IN AFRICA 597The other worrying problem was the state of the economy. Although in years of go^",
  "harvests Zimbabwe was regarded as \u2018the breadbasket of southern Africa\u2019, success",
  "depended heavily on the weather. During the 1980s there were more than the usual peri",
  "ods of drought, and the country also suffered from the high world price of oil. It was\u00ac",
  "becoming clear that although Mugabe was a clever politician, hiseconomic skills werenot",
  "so impressive. Since the 1987 Unity Accord, he had been pushing to turn Zimbabwe into",
  "a one-party state. However, this was thwarted when Edgar Tekere formed his Zimbabwe",
  "Unity Movement (ZUM) in 1989. Nevertheless, in 1990 Mugabe was still immensely",
  "popular and regarded as a hero by much of the population because of his vital role in the",
  "struggle for freedom. In 1990 he was re-elected president in a landslide victory overZUM.",
  "(b) The hero's image begins to tarnish",
  "During the 1990s Zimbabwe\u2019s economic problems worsened. After the collapse of the",
  "USSR Mugabe abandoned most of his Marxist policies and attempted to follow western",
  ",",
  "free-market methods. He accepted a loan from the IMF and, very much against public",
  "opinion, agreed to abide by the Economic Structural Adjustment Programme it imposed.",
  "This involved unpopular cuts in public spending on social services and jobs. Difficulties",
  "were compounded in 1992 by a severe drought, bringing a poor harvest and food- short\u00ac",
  "ages. More problems were caused when squatters occupied hundreds of white owned",
  "farms. About 4000 white farmers had stayed on in Zimbabwe after independence, and",
  "between them they owned about half the country\u2019s arable land. The government encour\u00ac",
  "aged the squatters and the police gave the farmers no protection: consequently the areas",
  "occupied by squatters were not cultivated, and this added to the food supply problem.",
  "Unemployment and inflation rose and the spread of AIDS began tocause concern.",
  "By the late 1990s unrest was growing. Mugabe\u2019s intervention to help President Laurent",
  "Kabila in the civil war in the Democratic Republic of the Congo was unpopular, sinceit",
  "was widely rumoured that his motive was to protect his own personal investments in that",
  "country. In November 1998 there were protest demonstrations when it wasannounced that",
  "Mugabe had awarded himself and his cabinet large pay increases.",
