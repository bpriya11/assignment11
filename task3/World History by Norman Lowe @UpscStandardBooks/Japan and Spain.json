  "15.1 JAPAN BEFORE THE SECOND WORLD WAR",
  "(a) In 1918 Japan was in a strong position in the Far East",
  "Japan\u2019s close contact with the West dated back to 1853, when the American Commodore",
  "Matthew Perry sailed into Yokohama harbour with four battleships and demanded that",
  "Japan should open up trade with the USA.Over the next five years Japan had little choice",
  "but to sign trade treaties with several Western countries. It was clear that the Western",
  "powers had imperialist designson Japan,and the signing of these treaties was regarded by",
  "the Japanese as a great national humiliation. Gradually a determination to modernize and",
  "strengthen the country developed. Beginning in 1868 with the restoration of the Meiji",
  "emperor, the Japanese embarked on a policy of building railways, improving the road",
  "system, starting modem industries, like cotton and silk manufacture, and introducing a",
  ".",
  "more democratic parliamentary system, modelled on Germany\u2019s constitution For the first",
  "time in over two and a half centuries Japan became a unified and centralized empire. The",
  "government decided that the best way to prevent the western powers from treating Japan",
  "in the same way as China was to occupy neighbouring territories; first Korea and then",
  "Manchuria were \u2018colonized\u2019, but this caused two wars, first with China (1894-95) and",
  ".",
  "then with Russia (1904-5) Japan was victorious in both wars; in the case of Russia, this",
  "was the first time that an Asian country had defeated one of the European great powers. It",
  "meant that Japan was now the dominant power in the Far East. A military alliance had",
  "already been signed with Britain in 1902,and when the First World Warbrokeoutin 1914,",
  "Japan entered the war on the side of Britain.Their main contribution was to seize German",
  ".",
  "colonies and bases in China Japan was represented at the Versailles peace conference in",
  "1919, became a member of the League of Nations and was officially recognized as one of",
  "- -",
  "the \u2018Big Five\u2019 world powers. Japan now had a powerful navy, a well trained and well",
  "equipped army and a great deal of influence in China.",
  "Japan had also benefited economically from the First World War, while the states of",
  ".",
  "Europe were busy fighting each other Japan took advantage of the situation both by",
  "providing the Allies with shipping and other goods, and by stepping in to supply orders,",
  ".",
  "especially in Asia, which the Europeans could not fulfil During the war years, the exports",
  "of Japanese cotton cloth almost trebled, while their merchant fleet doubled in tonnage.",
  "Politically the course seemed set fair for democracy when in 1925 all adult males were",
  "given the vote. Hopes were soon dashed: at the beginning of the 1930s the army assumed",
  ".",
  "control of the government",
  "(b) Why did Japan become a military dictatorship?",
  "During the 1920s problems developed,as they did in Italy and Germany, which democra",
  "\u00ac",
  ".",
  "tically elected governments seemed incapable of solving",
  "1 Influential elite groups beganto oppose democracy",
  "Democracy wasstill relatively new in Japan;it wasduring the 1880s that theemperor gave",
  "way to the growing demands fora national assembly,in the belief that it wasconstitutions",
  "and representative government which had made the USA and the countries of western",
  "Europe so successful. Gradually a more representative system was introduced consisting",
  "of a house of appointed peers,acabinet of ministersappointed by theemperor,and a Privy",
  "336 PART II THERISEOFFASCISM ANDGOVERNMENTS OFTHERIGHTCouncil whose function was to interpret and safeguard the new constitution, which was",
  "formally accepted in 1889. It provided foran elected lower house of parliament (the Diet);",
  "the first elections were held and the Diet met in 1890. However, the system was far from",
  "democratic and the emperor retained enormous power: he could dissolve the Diet when",
  "\u00ac",
  "- -",
  "ever he felt like it, he took decisions about war and peace, he was commander in chief of",
  "the armed forces, and he was regarded as \u2018sacred and inviolable\u2019. But the Diet had one",
  "great advantage: it could initiate new laws, and consequently the cabinet found that it was",
  "not as susceptible to their will as they had expected.",
  "At first the elite groups in society were content to give the government free rein, but",
  "after the First World War they began to be more critical. Especially troublesome were the",
  "army and the conservatives, who were strongly entrenched in the house of Peersand in the",
  "Privy Council. They seized every opportunity to discredit the government. For example,",
  "they criticized Baron Shidehara Kijuro (foreign minister 1924-7) for his conciliatory",
  "approach to China, which he thought was the best way to strengthen Japan\u2019s economic",
  "hold over thatcountry.The army was itching to interfere in China, which was torn by civil",
  "war, and considered Shidehara\u2019s policy to be \u2018soft\u2019.They were strong enough to bring the",
  "government down in 1927 and reverse his policy.",
  "2 Corrupt politicians",
  "Many politicians were corrupt and regularly accepted bribesfrom big business;sometimes",
  "fighting broke out in the lower house (the Diet) as charges and counter-charges of corrup",

  "When economic problems were added to the political ones, the situation became serious",
  "The great trading boom of the war years lasted only until the middle of 1921, when Europe",

  "began to revive and recover lost markets In Japan, unemployment and industrial unrest",
  "developed,and at the same time farmers were hit by the rapidly falling price of rice caused",
  "byaseriesof bumper harvests.When farmersand industrial workerstried toorganizethem",

  "asdemocratic, butallowed the left to be suppressed,and accepted bribesfrom big business.",
  "4 The world economic crisis",
  "The world economic crisis beginning in 1929 (see Section 22.6) affected Japan severely.",
  "Exports shrank disastrously and other countries introduced or raised tariffs against",
  "Japanese goods to safeguard theirown industries.One of the worstaffected trades was the",
  "export of raw silk, which went mostly to the USA. The period after the Wall Street Crash",
  "was no time for luxuries, and the Americans drastically reduced their imports of raw silk,",
  "so that by 1932 the price had fallen to less than one-fifth of the 1923 figure. This was a",
  "further blow for Japanese farmers, since about half of them relied for their livelihood on",

  "the production of raw silk as well as rice There was desperate poverty, especially in the",

  "Mostof the army recruits were peasants;consequently the rank and fileas well as the offi",

  "early as 1927,many officers,attracted by fascism, were planning to seize powerand intro",
  "\u00ac",
  "duce a strong nationalist government.",
  "5 The situation in Manchuria",
  "Matters were brought to a head in 1931 by the situation in Manchuria, a large province of",
  "China,with a population of 30 million,in which Japan had valuable investmentsand trade.",
  "337",
  "JAPAN ANDSPAINThe Chinese were trying to squeeze out Japanese trade and business, which would have",

  "rians blame Emperor Hirohito who, though he deplored the attack on Manchuria, refused",
  "to become involved in political controversy,afraid to risk hisordersfora withdrawal being",
  "ignored. Historian Richard Storry claims that \u2018it would have been better for Japan and for",

  "the majority of officers would have obeyed him if he had tried to restrain the attacks on",
  "Manchuria and China. When the Second World War began, it seems that the emperor",
  "genuinely wanted to stay out of it, and hesitated over whether or not to sign an alliance",
  "with NaziGermany.However,after theearly successesof the German Blitzkrieg heagreed",
  "to the alliance, and eventually, to the attack on Pearl Harbor (see Section 6.2(c)), thereby",
  "giving the military the chance to achieve their ambition-to continue with the conquest of",

  "China and south-east Asia",
  "The war began successfully for the Japanese: by May 1942 they had captured Hong",
  "Kong, Malaya,Singapore and Burma (all belonging to Britain), the Dutch East Indies, the",

  "way of stopping them. However, it became clear that the attack on Pearl Harbor was not",

  "quite the success it had seemed at first It did not destroy the American aircraft carriers",
  "which were out at sea, and it was the aircraft carriers that were to prove the vital element",
  "in Japan\u2019sdefeat. In June the Americans,using planesfrom three aircraft carriers,inflicted",
  "a severe defeat on the Japanese at Midway Island (see Section 6.3(a)). This proved to be",
  "a crucial turning point in the war, with Japan suffering a series of reverses over the next",
  "over the next three years. It was a long and bitter struggle which ended in August 1945",
  "with the Japanese surrender after the Americans had dropped two atomic bombs, one on",
  "Hiroshima and the second on Nagasaki. Japan\u2019s ambitions of a great empire were dashed",
  "and the country and its economy were largely in ruins.",

  "2 The KoreanWar(1950 3) gave an important boostto Japan\u2019s recovery Japan was",
  "ideally placed to act as a base for the United Nations forces involved in Korea;",
  "Japanese manufacturers were used to provide a wide range of materials and",
  "supplies. The close relationship with the USA meant that Japan\u2019s security was well",
  "taken care of; this meant that Japan was able to invest in industry all the cash that",
  "would otherwise have been spent on armaments.",
  "3 Much of Japan\u2019s industry had been destroyed during the war; this enabled the new",

  "factories and plants to start afresh with all the latest technology In 1959 the",

  "of Catalonia, was banned because it was \u2018not Spanish\u2019. The use of the Galician, Catalan",
