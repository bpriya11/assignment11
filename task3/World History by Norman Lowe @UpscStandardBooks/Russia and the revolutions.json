  "SUMMARY OF EVENTS",
  "In the early yearsof the twentieth century,Russia was in a troubled state. Nicholas II, who",
  "was Tsar (emperor) from 1894 until 1917, insisted on ruling as an autocrat (someone who",
  "rules a country as he sees fit, without being responsible to a parliament), but had failed to",
  "dealadequately with thecountry\u2019s many problems.Unrestandcriticismof the government",
  "reached aclimaxin 1905 with the Russian defeats in the waragainst Japan (1904-5); there",

  "(cid:127) .",
  "the Bolshevik revolution (October/November)",
  "The new Bolshevik government was shaky at first, and its opponents (known as the",
  "Whites) tried to destroy it, causing a bitter civil war (1918-20). Thanks to the leadership",
  "of Lenin and Trotsky, the Bolsheviks (Reds) won the civil war, and, now calling them",
  "\u00ac",
  "selves communists, were able to consolidate their power. Lenin began the task of leading",
  "Russia to recovery, but he died prematurely in January 1924.",
  "16.1 AFTER 1905: WERE THE REVOLUTIONS OF 1917 INEVITABLE?",
  "(a) Nicholas II tries to stabilize his regime",
  "Nicholas survived the 1905 revolution because:",
  "(cid:127)",
  "his opponents were not united;",
  "(cid:127)",
  "there was no central leadership (the whole thing having flared up spontaneously);",
  "(cid:127)",
  "most of the army remained loyal;",
  "(cid:127)",
  "he had been willing to compromise at the critical moment by issuing the October",
  "Manifesto, promising concessions. These included allowing an elected parliament",
  "(Duma); granting basic civil liberties to the population -freedom of conscience, of",
  "speech, of assembly and of association; universal suffrage in elections for the",
  "Duma; no law could begin to operate without the approval of the Duma.",
  "RUSSIA ANDTHEREVOLUTIONS,1900-24 351The Manifesto appeared to grant many of the demands of the moderate liberal reform",
  "\u00ac",
  "ers, so that tsarism now had a breathing space in which Nicholas had an excellent oppor",
  "\u00ac",
  "tunity to make a constitutional monarchy work, and to throw himself on the side of the",

  "moderate reformers However, there were other demands not addressed in the Manifesto,",
  "for example:",
  "(cid:127)",
  "improvements in industrial working conditions and pay;",
  "(cid:127) cancellation of redemption payments-these were annual payments to the govern",
  "\u00ac",
  "ment by peasants in return for their freedom and some land,following the abolition",
  "of serfdom in 1861: although peasants had received their legal freedom, these",
  "compulsory payments had reduced over half the rural population to dire poverty;",
  "(cid:127) an amnesty for political prisoners.",
  "Unfortunately Nicholas seems to have had very little intention of keeping to the spirit of",
  ".",
  "the October Manifesto, having agreed to it only because he had no choice",
  "1 The First Duma (1906) was not democratically elected, for although all classes",
  "were allowed to vote, the system was rigged so that landowners and the middle",
  "classes would be in the majority.Even so,it putforward far-reaching demandssuch",

  "\u00ac",
  "vativeand thereforelasted longer.Though on occasion theycriticized thegovernment,",
  "they had no power, because the Tsar controlled the ministers and the secret police.",
  "Some foreign observers were surprised at the ease with which Nicholas ignored his",
  "promises and was able to dismiss the first two Dumas without provoking another general",
  "strike. The fact was that the revolutionary impetus had subsided for the time being, and",
  ".",
  "many leaders were either in prison or in exile",
  "This, together with the improvement in the economy beginning after 1906, has given",
  "rise to some controversy about whether or not the 1917 revolutions were inevitable. The",
  "traditional liberal view was that although the regime had obvious weaknesses, there were",
  "signs that shortly before the First World War broke out, living standards were improving,",
  "and that given time, the chancesof revolution would have diminished.The strengths were",
  "beginning to outweigh the weaknesses, and so the monarchy would probably have",

  "deliberate flouting of his 1905 promises, there was bound to be a revolution sooner or",
  "later.The situation wasdeteriorating again before Russia\u2019sinvolvement in the First World",
  "War; therefore the inevitable completion of the \u2018unfinished\u2019 revolution of 1905-6 could",
  ".",
  "not be long delayed",
  "(b) Strengths of the regime",
  "1 The government seemed to recover remarkably quickly, with most of its powers",
  "intact. PeterStolypin, prime ministerfrom 1906 to 1911, introduced strict repressive",
  "352",
  "PART III COMMUNISM-RISEANDDECLINEmeasures, with some 4000 people being executed over the next three years. But he",
  "also broughtinsomereformsandmade determinedeffortstowinoverthe peasants,",
  "believing that, given 20 years of peace, there would be no question of revolution.",
  "Redemption payments were abolished and peasants were encouraged to buy their",
  "own land; about 2 million had done so by 1916 and another 3.5 million had",
  "emigrated to Siberia where they had their own farms. As a result, there emerged a",
  "-",
  "class of comfortably off peasants (kulaks) on whom the government could rely for",
  "support against revolution,or so Stolypin hoped.",
  "2 As morefactories came- under the control of inspectors, there were signs of improv\u00ac",
  "ing working conditions,asindustrial profitsincreased, thefirstsignsof a more pros",
  "\u00ac",
  "perous workforce could be detected. In 1912 a workers\u2019 sickness and accident",
  "insurance scheme was introduced.",
  "3 In 1908 a programme was announced to bring about universal education within ten",
  "years,by 1914 an extra 50 000 primary schools had been opened.",
  "'",
  "4 At the same time the revolutionary parties seemed to have lost heart, they were",
  "'",
  "short of money, torn by disagreements, and their leaders were still in exile.",
  "(c) Weaknesses of the regime",
  "1 Failure of the land reforms",
  "By 1911 it was becoming clear that Stolypin\u2019s land reforms would not have the desired",
  "effect, partly because the peasant population was growing too rapidly (at the rate of 1.5",
  "million a year) for his schemes to cope with, and because farming methods were too inef",
  "\u00ac",
  ".",
  "ficient to support the growing population adequately The assassination of Stolypin in",
  "1911 removed one of the few really able tsarist ministers and perhaps the only man who",
  ".",
  "could have saved the monarchy",
  "2 Industrial unrest",
  "There was a wave of industrial strikes set off by the shooting of 270 striking gold miners",
  "in the Lena goldfields in Siberia (April 1912). In all there were over 2000 separate strikes",
  "in that year, 2400 in 1913, and over 4000 in the first seven months of 1914, before war",
  "broke out. Whatever improvements had taken place, they were obviously not enough to",
  "remove all the pre-1905 grievances.",
  "3 Government repression",
  "There was little relaxation of the government\u2019s repressive policy, as the secret police",
  "rooted out revolutionaries among university studentsand lecturers and deported massesof",
  "Jews, thereby ensuring that both groups were firmly anti-tsarist. The situation was partic",
  "\u00ac",
  "ularly dangerous because the government had made the mistake of alienating three of the",
  "most important sections in society - peasants, industrial workers and the intelligentsia",
  ".",
  "(educated classes)",
  "4 Revival of the revolutionary parties",
  "As 1912 progressed, the fortunes of the various revolutionary parties, especially the",
  "Bolsheviks and Mensheviks, revived. Both groups had developed from an earlier move",
  ". \u00ac",
  "ment, the Social Democrat Labour Party, which was Marxist in outlook Karl Marx",
  "(1818-83) was a German Jew whose political ideas were set out in the Communist",
  "Manifesto (1848) and Das Kapital (Capital) (1867). He believed that economic factors",
  "were the real cause of historical change, and that workers (proletariat) were everywhere",
  "-",
  "exploited by capitalists (middle class bourgeoisie); this means that when asociety became",
  "fully industrialized, the workers would inevitably rise up against their exploiters and take",
  "353",
  "RUSSIA ANDTHEREVOLUTIONS, 1900-24.",
  "control themselves, running the country in their own interests Marx called this \u2018the dicta",
  ". \u00ac",
  "torshipof the proletariat\u2019 When this point was reached there would be no further need for",
  "the \u2018state\u2019, which would consequently \u2018wither away\u2019.",
  "One of the Social Democrat leaders was Vladimir Lenin, who helped to edit the revo",
  "\u00ac",
  "lutionary newspaper Iskra (The Spark). It was over an election to the editorial board of",
  "Iskra in 1903 that the party had split into Lenin\u2019s supporters, the Bolsheviks (the Russian",

  "word for \u2018majority\u2019), and the rest, the Mensheviks (minority)",
  "Lenin and the Bolsheviks wanted a small, disciplined party of professional revolu",
  "- \u00ac",
  "tionaries who would work full time to bring about revolution;because the industrial",
  "workers were in a minority, Lenin believed they must work with the peasants as",
  ".",
  "well, and get them involved in revolutionary activity",
  "The Mensheviks,on the other hand, were happy to have party membership open",
  "to anybody who cared to join; they believed that a revolution could not take place",
  "in Russia until the country wasfully industrialized and industrial workers were in",
  "-",
  "a big majority over peasants; they had very little faith in co operation from peas",
  "\u00ac",
  "ants, who were actually one of the most conservative groups in society. The",
  "Mensheviks were the strict Marxists, believing in a proletarian revolution,",
  "whereas Lenin was the one moving away from Marxism. In 1912 appeared the",
  "new Bolshevik newspaper Pravda (Truth), which was extremely important for",
  "publicizing Bolshevik ideas and giving political direction to the already develop",
  "\u00ac",
  "ing strike wave.",
  "The Social Revolutionaries were another revolutionary party; they were not",
  "Marxists- they did not approve of increasing industrialization and did not think",
  ".",
  "in terms of a proletarian revolution After the overthrow of the tsarist regime,",
  "they wanted a mainly agrarian society based on peasant communities operating",
  ".",
  "collectively",
  "5 The royal family discredited",
  "The royal family was discredited by a number of scandals. It was widely suspected that",
  "Nicholas himself was a party to the murder of Stolypin, who was shot by a member of the",
  "secret police in the Tsar\u2019s presence during a gala performance at the Kiev opera. Nothing",
  "was ever proved, but Nicholas and his right-wing supporters were probably not sorry to",
  "see the back of Stolypin, who was becoming too liberal for their comfort.",
  "-",
  "More serious was the royal family\u2019s association with Rasputin, a self professed \u2018holy",
  "man\u2019, who made himself indispensable to the Empress Alexandra by hisability to help the",
  ".",
  "ailing heir to the throne,Alexei This unfortunate child had inherited haemophiliafrom his",
  "mother\u2019s family, and Rasputin was able, on occasion, apparently through hypnosis and",
  "prayer, to stop the bleeding when Alexei suffered a haemorrhage. Eventually Rasputin",
  "became a real power behind the throne, but attracted public criticism by his drunkenness",

  "and his numerousaffairs with court ladies Alexandra preferred to ignore the scandalsand",

  "the Duma's request that Rasputin be sent away from the court (1912)",
  "(d) The verdict?",
  "The weight of evidence seems to suggest therefore that events were moving towards some",
  ".",
  "sort of upheaval before the First World War broke out There was a general strike orga",
  "\u00ac",
  "nized by the Bolsheviks in St Petersburg (the capital) in July 1914 with street demonstra",
  "\u00ac",
  "tions, shootings and barricades. The strike ended on 15 July, a few days before the war",
  "began; the government still controlled the army and the police at this point and might well",
  "have been able to hold on to power, but writers such as George Kennan and Leopold",
  "354 PART III COMMUNISM-RISEANDDECLINEHaimson believed that the tsarist regime would have collapsed sooner or later even with",

  "ine that it could have survived long, even without the war\u2019",
  ".",
  "On the other hand, some recent historians are more cautious Christopher Read thinks",
  "the overthrow of the monarchy was by no means inevitable, and that the situation in the",
  "years immediately before 1914 could have continued indefinitely, provided there was no",

  "(e) War failures made revolution certain",
  "Historians agree that Russian failures in the war made revolution certain, causing troops",
  "and police to mutiny, so that there was nobody left to defend the autocracy. The war",
  ".",
  "revealed the incompetent and corrupt organization and the shortage of equipment Poor",
  "transport organization and distribution meant that arms and ammunition were slow to",
  "reach the front; although there was plenty of food in the country, it did not get to the big",
  "cities in sufficient quantities, because most of the trains were being monopolized by the",
  "military. Bread was scarce and very expensive.",
  "Norman Stone has shown that the Russian army acquitted itself reasonably well, and",
  ".",
  "Brusilov\u2019s 1916 offensive was an impressive success (see Section 2.3(c)) However,",
  "Nicholas made the fatal mistake of appointing himself supreme commander (August",
  "1915); his tactical blunders threw away all the advantages won by Brusilov\u2019s offensive,",
  "and drew on himself the blame for later defeats, and for the high death rate.",
  "By January 1917, most groups in society were disillusioned with the incompetent way",
  "the Tsar was running the war. The aristocracy, the Duma, many industrialists and the",
  "army were beginning to turn against Nicholas, feeling that it would be better to sacrifice",
  "him to avoid a much worse revolution that might sweep away the whole social structure.",
  "General Krimov told a secret meeting of Duma members at the end of 1916: \u2018We would",
  ".",
  "welcome the news of a coup d\u2019etat A revolution is imminent and we at the front feel it",
  "to be so. If you decide on such an extreme step, we will support you. Clearly there is no",
  "other way.\u2019",
  "16.2 THE TWO REVOLUTIONS: FEBRUARY/MARCH AND OCTOBER/",
  "NOVEMBER 1917",
  "The revolutions are still known in Russia as the February and October Revolutions. This",
  "is because the Russians were still using the old Julian calendar, which was 13days behind",
  "the Gregorian calendar used by the rest of Europe. Russia adopted the Gregorian calendar",
  "in 1918. The events which the Russians know as the February Revolution began on 23",
  ".",
  "February 1917 (Julian), which was 8 March outside Russia When the Bolsheviks took",
  "power on 25 October (Julian), it was 7 November elsewhere. In this section, the Julian",
  "calendar is used for internal events in Russia, and the Gregorian calendarfor international",
  "events such as the First World War, until 1 February 1918.",
  "RUSSIA ANDTHEREVOLUTIONS, 1900-24 355(a) The February Revolution",
  "The first revolution began on 23 February when bread riots broke out in Petrograd (St",
  "Petersburg). The rioters were quickly joined by thousands of strikers from a nearby arma",
  ". \u00ac",
  "ments factory The Tsar sent orders for the troops to use force to end the demonstrations,",
  "and 40 people were killed. Soon, however,some of the troops began to refuse to fire at the",
  "unarmed crowds and the whole Petrograd garrison mutinied. Mobs seized public buildings,",
  "released prisoners from jails and took over police stations and arsenals. The Duma advised",
  "Nicholas to set up a constitutional monarchy, but he refused and sent more troops to",
  ".",
  "Petrograd to try to restore order This convinced the Duma and the generals that Nicholas,",
  "who was on his way back to Petrograd, would have to go. Some of his senior generals told",
  ".",
  "Nicholas that the only way to save the monarchy was for him to renounce the throne On 2",
  "March, in the imperial train standing in a siding near Pskov, the Tsarabdicated in favourof",
  "his brother, the Grand Duke Michael. Unfortunately nobody had made sure that Michael",
  ".",
  "would accept the throne,so when he refused, the Russian monarchy came to an end",
  "Was it a revolution from above or below,organized or spontaneous? This has been the",
  "subject of some controversy among historians. George Katkov thought that the conspiracy",
  "among the elite was the decisive factor - nobles, Duma members and generals forced",
  "Nicholas to abdicate in order to prevent a real mass revolution developing. W. H.",
  "Chamberlin, writing in 1935,came to the opposite conclusion: \u2018it wasone of the most lead",
  "\u00ac",
  "erless, spontaneous, anonymous revolutions of all time\u2019. The revolution from below by the",
  "masseswasdecisive,becauseit threw theeliteintoapanic;withoutthecrowdson thestreets,",
  "there would have been no need for the elite to act. None of the traditional liberal historians",
  "thought the revolutionary parties had played a significant role in organizing the events.",
  "Soviet historians agreed with Chamberlin that it was a revolution from below, but they",
  "did not accept that it was spontaneous. On the contrary, they made out a strong case that",
  "the Bolsheviks had played a vital role in organizing strikes and demonstrations. Many",
  "recent Western historians have supported the theory of a mass uprising organized from",
  ".",
  "below, but not necessarily one organized by the Bolsheviks There were many activists",
  "among the workers who were not affiliated to any political group. Historians such as",
  "Christopher Read,Diane Koenkerand SteveSmith haveall shown that workers were moti",

  "outburst of desperation to secure the basic material needsand a decent standard of living\u2019",
  "(b) The provisional government",
  "Most people expected the autocracy of the tsarist system to be replaced by a democratic",
  "republic with an elected parliament.The Duma,struggling to take control,set up a mainly",
  "liberal provisional government with Prince George Lvov as prime minister. In July he was",
  "replaced by Alexander Kerensky, a moderate socialist. But the new government was just",

  "not kept was for land reform-the redistribution of land from large estates among",

  "peasants. Tired of waiting,some peasants started to seize land from landlords The",
  "Bolsheviks were able to use peasant discontent to win support.",
  "4 Meanwhile, thanks to a new political amnesty, Lenin was able to return from exile",
  "in Switzerland (April). The Germans allowed him to travel through to Petrograd in",
  "a special \u2018sealed\u2019 train, in the hope that he would cause further chaos in Russia.",
  "After a rapturous welcome, he urged (in his April Theses) that the Bolsheviks",
  "should cease to support the provisional government, that all power should be taken",
  ".",
  "by the soviets, and that Russia should withdraw from the war",
  "5 There was increasing economic chaos, with inflation, rising bread prices, lagging",
  "wages and shortages of raw materials and fuel. Industry was severely handicapped",
  ".",
  "by a shortage of investment In the midst of all this, Lenin and the Bolsheviks put",
  "forward what seemed to be a realistic and attractive policy: a separate peace with",
  "Germany to get Russia out of the war,all land to be given to the peasants, workers\u2019",
  "control in the factories and more food at cheaper prices.",
  ".",
  "6 The government lost popularity because of the \u2018July Days\u2019 On 3 July there was",

  "it was reported, falsely, that Lenin was a German spy. At this, the popularity of",
  "the Bolsheviks declined rapidly; Lenin fled to Finland and other leaders were",
  "arrested. But about 400 people had been killed during the violence, and Prince",
  "Lvov, who was deeply shocked by the July Days, resigned. He was replaced by",
  "Alexander Kerensky. It is still not absolutely clear who was responsible for the",
  "events of the July Days. American historian Richard Pipes is convinced that",
  "Lenin planned the whole affair from the beginning; Robert Service, on the other",
  "hand, argues that Lenin was improvising, \u2018testing the waters\u2019 to discover how",
  "determined the provisional government was. The demonstration was probably",

  "the Bolsheviks General Kornilov, the army commander-in-chief, viewed the",

  "brought troops towards Petrograd (August). However, many of his soldiers",
  "mutinied and Kerensky ordered Kornilov\u2019s arrest. Army discipline seemed on the",
  "verge of collapse; public opinion swung against the war and in favour of the",
  "Bolsheviks, who were still the only party to talk openly about making a separate",
  "peace. By October they had won a majority over the Mensheviks and Social",
  "Revolutionaries (SRs) in both the Petrograd and Moscow soviets,though they were",
  "in a minority in the country as a whole. Leon Trotsky (who had just become a",

  "Whatever the intentions of the Bolsheviks, there is no doubt that violence and terror",
  "became widespread. The Red Army was used to enforce the procurement of grain from",
  "peasants who were thought to have surpluses. During 1918 the Cheka suppressed 245",
  "peasant uprisings and 99 in the first seven months of 1919. Official Cheka figures show",
  "that during the course of these operations over 3000 peasants were killed and 6300",
  "executed; in 1919 there were over 3000 more executions, but the actual death toll was",
  "probably much higher.Social Revolutionariesand other political opponents were rounded",

  ".",
  "period of the New Economic Policy (NEP) For example, in May 1919 Lenin wrote a",
  "pamphlet in which he explained that the main obstacle to the achievement of socialism in",
  "Russia was the culture of backwardness left over from centuries of tsarist rule. According",
  "to Lenin, the best way to change this was not by forcible means, but by education, which",
  "unfortunately would take a long time.",
  "Other historiansargue that the civil war was one of the influences which brutalized the",
  "communist regime, but that it was not the only one.Christopher Read makes the point that",
  "the Bolsheviks were products of the tsarist environment, which had itself been extremely",
  "authoritarian;tsaristgovernments had never hesitated to use extreme methodsagainst their",
  "enemies. It was only a few years since Stolypin had executed around 4000 opponents. \u2018In",
  "the prevailing circumstances\u2019, argues Read, \u2018it is hard to see why opposition should be",
  "tolerated when the Russian tradition was toeradicateitas heresy.\u2019 Among the older gener",
  "\u00ac",
  "ation of liberal historians,Adam Ulam argued that violenceand terror were an integral part",
  "of communism, and claimed that Lenin actually welcomed the civil war because it gave",
  "him an excuse to use more violence.",
  "There is the same debate about theeconomic featuresof warcommunism: were nation",
  "\u00ac",
  "alization and state control of the economy central to communist aims and ideals, or were",
  "they forcedon thegovernment by the need to harness the economy to the wareffort? Even",
  "Soviet historians differ in their interpretations of this. Some believe that the Party had a",
  "basic plan for nationalizing the major industries as soon as possible: hence the national",
  ". \u00ac",
  "ization of banks, railways, shipping and hundreds of large factories by June 1918 Others",
  "believe that what Lenin really hoped for was a mixed economy in which some capitalist",
  "activity would be allowed. Alec Nove came to the very sensibleconclusion that \u2018Lenin and",
  "his colleagues were playing it by ear. ... We must allow for the interaction of Bolshevik",
  ".",
  "ideas with the desperate situation in which they found themselves\u2019",
  "(g) Lenin and the economic problems",
  "From early 1921 Lenin faced the formidable task of rebuilding an economy shattered by",
  "the First World War and then by civil war. War communism had been unpopular with the",
  "peasants, who, seeing no point in working hard to produce food which was taken away",
  "from them without compensation, simply produced enough for their own needs. This",
  "caused severefood shortagesaggravated by droughts in 1920-1. In addition, industry was",
  "almost at a standstill. In March 1921 a serious naval mutiny occurred at Kronstadt, the",
  "366 PART III COMMUNISM-RISEANDDECLINEisland naval base just off St Petersburg. This was suppressed only through prompt action",
  "by Trotsky, whosent troops across the ice on the frozen sea.",
  "The mutiny seems to have convinced Lenin that a new approach was needed to win",
  ",",
  "back the falteringsupport of the peasants;thiswasvitally importantsince peasantsformed",
  "a large majority of the population. He put into operation what became known as the New",
  ".",
  "Economic Policy (NEP) Peasants were now allowed to keep surplus produce after",
  "payment of a tax representing a certain proportion of the surplus. This, plus the reintro\u00ac",
  "duction of private trade, revived incentive and food production increased.Small industries",
  ",",
  "and trade in their products were also restored to privateownership, though heavy industry",
  "such as coal, iron and steel, together with power, transport and banking, remained under",
  "state control. Lenin alsofound that often theold managers had to be brought back,as well",
  "as such capitalist incentives as bonuses and piece-rates. Foreign investment was encour",
  "\u00ac",
  "aged, to help develop and modernize Russian industry.",
  "There is the usual debate among historians about Lenin s motives and intentions.Some",
  "Bolsheviksclaimed that the Kronstadt mutiny and peasant unrest had nobearingon thedeci",
  "\u00ac",
  "sion tochangeto NEP;thatinfact they had beenon thepointof introducinganearlier version",
  "of NEPwhen the outbreak of thecivil war prevented them.Toconfuse mattersfurther,some",
  "of the other communist leaders, especially Kamenev and Zinoviev, disapproved of NEP",
  "becausethey thought itencouraged thedevelopment of kulaks(wealthy peasants),whowould",
  "turn out tobe theenemiesof communism.They saw itasa retreat from truesocialism.",
  "Did Lenin intend NEP as a temporary compromise - a return to a certain amount of",
  "private enterprise until recovery was assured; or did he see it as a return to something like",
  "thecorrect road to.socialism,from which they had beendiverted by thecivil war?It isdiffi\u00ac",
  "cult tobecertainone way or theother.What isclearisthat Lenindefended NEPvigorously:",
  "hesaid they needed the experienceof the capitaliststoget the economy bloomingagai-n. In",
  "May 1921 he told the Party that NEP must be pursued \u2018seriously and for a long time not",
  "less than a decade and probably more\u2019.They had to take into account the fact that instead",
  "of introducing socialism in a country dominated by industrial workers- the true allies of",
  "the Bolsheviks-they were working in a backward, peasant-dominated society. Therefore",
  "NEPwas not aretreat-it wasan attempttofindan alternativeroad tosocialism in less than",
  "idealcircumstances.Itwouldrequirealongcampaignofeducatingthepeasantsinthebene\u00ac",
  "fits of agrarian co-operatives so that force would not be necessary; this would lead to the",
  "triumphof socialism.Roy Medvedev,adissidentSoviet historian,wasconvinced that these",
  "were Lenin\u2019sgenuine intentions,and that if he had lived another 20 years(to thesameage",
  "asStalin), the future of the USSR would have been very different.",
  "NEP was moderately successful: theeconomy began to recover and production levels",
  "were improving; in most commodities they were not far off the 1913 levels. Given the",
  "territorial losses at the end of the First World War and the war with Poland, this was a",
  "considerable achievement. Great progress was made with the electrification of industry,",
  "one of Lenin\u2019s petschemes.Towards the end of 1927, when NEP began to be abandoned,",
  "the ordinary Russian was probably better off than at any timesince 1914. Industrial work\u00ac",
  "ers who had a job were being paid real wages and they had the benefits of NEP\u2019s new",
  "social legislation: an eight-hour working day, two weeks\u2019 holiday with pay, sick and",
  "unemployment pay and healthcare.The peasants wereenjoyinga higherstandard of living",
  "than in 1913. The downside of NEP was that unemployment was higher than before, and",
  "there were still frequent food shortages.",
  "(h) Political problems were solved decisively",
  "Russia was now the world\u2019s first communist state, the Union of Soviet Socialist",
  "Republics (USSR); power was held by the Communist Party, and no other parties were",

  "The governing body in the Party was known as the \u2018Politburo\u2019 During the civil war,",

  ",",
  "(see Illus. 17.1).",
  "At first it seemed unlikely that Stalin would become the dominant figure; Trotsky",
  "called him \u2018the party\u2019s most eminent mediocrity ... a man destined to play second or third",
  "fiddle\u2019. The Menshevik Nikolai Sukhanov described him as \u2018nothing more than a vague,",
  "grey blur\u2019. Lenin thought him stubborn and rude, and suggested in his will that Stalin",
  "should be removed from his post. \u2018Comrade Stalin has concentrated enormous power in",
  "his hands,\u2019 he wrote, \u2018and I am not sure healways knows how to use that power with suffi\u00ac",
  "cient caution. ... He is too crude, and this defect becomes unacceptable in the position of",
  "General-Secretary. I therefore propose to comrades that they should devise a means of",
  "removing him from this job.\u2019",
  "The most obvious successor to Lenin was Leon Trotsky, an inspired orator, an intel\u00ac",
  "lectual and a man of action -the organizer of the Red Armies.The other candidates were",
  "the \u2018old\u2019 Bolsheviks who had been in the Party since the early days; Lev Kamenev (head",
  "of the Moscow party organization), Grigori Zinoviev (head of the Leningrad party organi\u00ac",
  "zation and the Comintern) and Nikolai Bukharin, the rising intellectual star of the Party.",
  "However, circumstances arose which Stalin was able to use to eliminate his rivals.",
  "THEUSSR ANDSTALIN 1924-53 373",
  ",(a) Trotsky's brilliance worked against him",
  "It aroused envy and resentment among the other Politburo members. He was arrogant and",
  "condescending,and many resented the fact that he had only joined the Bolsheviks shortly",
  "before the November revolution. During Lenin\u2019s illness, he was bitterly critical of",
  "Kamenev, Zinoviev and Bukharin, who were acting as a triumvirate, accusing them of",
  "having no plan for the future and no vision. The others therefore decided to run the coun",
  "\u00ac",
  "try jointly:collective action was better than aone-man show. They worked together,doing",
  "all they could to prevent Trotsky from becoming leader. By the end of 1924almost all his",
  "support had disappeared; he was even forced to resign as Commissar for Military and",
  ".",
  "Naval Affairs, though he remained a member of the Politburo",
  "(b) The other Politburo members underestimated Stalin",
  "They saw him as nothing more than a competent administrator; they ignored Lenin\u2019s",
  "adviceabout removing him. They wereso busy attackingTrotsky that theyfailed to recog",
  "\u00ac",
  "nize the very real danger from Stalin and they missed several chances to get rid of him. In",
  "fact Stalin had great political skill and intuition; he had the ability to cut through the",
  "complexities of a problem and focus on the essentials; and he was an excellent judge of",
  ".",
  "character,sensing people\u2019s weaknesses and exploiting them He knew that both Kamenev",
  "and Zinoviev were good team members but lacked leadership qualitiesand sound political",
  "judgement. He simply had to wait for disagreements to arise among his colleagues in the",
  "Politburo; then he would side with one faction against another, eliminating his rivals one",
  "by one until he was left supreme.",
  "(c) Stalin used his position cleverly",
  "As Secretary-General of the Party,a position he had held since April 1922,Stalin had full",
  "powers of appointment and promotion to important jobs such as secretaries of local",
  "Communist Party organizations. He quietly filled these positions with his own supporters,",
  ".",
  "while at the same time removing the supporters of others to distant parts of the country",
  "Thelocalorganizationschose the delegates to national Party Conferences,and so the Party",
  ".",
  "Conferences gradually filled with Stalin\u2019s supporters The Party Congresses elected the",
  "Communist Party Central Committee and the Politburo; thus by 1928 all the top bodies",
  ".",
  "and congresses were packed with Stalinites, and he was unassailable",
  "(d) Stalin used the disagreements to his own advantage",
  "Disagreement over policy arose in the Politburo partly because Marx had never described",
  "in detail exactly how the new communist society should be organized. Even Lenin was",
  "vague about it, except that \u2018the dictatorship of the proletariat\u2019 would be established-that",
  "is, workers would run the state and the economy in their own interests. When all opposi",

  "Lenin had departed from socialist principles, though whether he intended this as a tempo",
  "\u00ac",
  "rary measure until thecrisis passed is still open todebate. Now the right wing of the Party,",
  "led by Bukharin, and the left, whose views were most strongly put by Trotsky, Kamenev",
  "and Zinoviev, fell out about what to do next:",
  "374",

  "\u00ac",
  "trialized states o! western Europe would help Russia with her industrialization.",
  "Kamenev and Zinoviev supported Bukharin in this, because it was a good pretext",
  "for attacking Trotsky.",
  "2 Bukharin wanted to continue NEP, even though it was causing an increase in the",
  "numbersoi wealthy peasants,kulaks(fists),socalled because they weresaid tohold",
  "the ordinary peasants tightly in their grasp.Some even employed poor peasants as",
  "labourers, and were therefore regarded as budding capitalists and enemies of",
  "communism. Bukharin\u2019s opponents, who now included Kamenev and Zinoviev,",
  "wanted toabandon NEPand concentrateon rapid industrialization at theexpenseof",
  ".",
  "the peasants",
  "Stalin, quietly ambitious, seemed to have no strong views either way at first, but on the",
  "question of \u2018socialism in one country' he came out in support of Bukharin, so that",
  "Trotsky was completely isolated. Later, when the split occurred between Bukharin on",
  "the one hand and Kamenev and Zinoviev, who were feeling unhappy about NEP, on the",

  "Turkey",
  ".",
  "Stalin and Bukharin were now the joint leaders, but Bukharin did not survive for long",
  ".",
  "The following year Stalin, who had supported NEP and its great advocate Bukharin, ever",
  "since it was introduced now decided that NEP must go-he claimed that the kulaks were",
  ",",
  "holding up agricultural progress. When Bukharin protested, he too was voted off the",
  "Politburo (1929), leaving Stalin supreme. Stalin's critics claimed that this was a cynical",
  "change of policy on his part, designed simply to eliminate Bukharin. To be fair to Stalin,",
  "it does seem to have been a genuine policy decision; NEP had begun to falter and was not",
  "producing the necessary amounts of food. Robert Service makes the point that Stalin\u2019s",
  "policies were actually popular with the vast majority of party members, who genuinely",
  "believed that the kulaks were blocking progress to socialism and getting rich while the",
  "industrial workers went short of food.",
  "17.2 HOW SUCCESSFUL WAS STALIN IN SOLVING RUSSIA'S",
  "ECONOMIC PROBLEMS?",
  "(a) What were Russia's economic problems?",
  "I Although Russian industry was recoveringfrom theeffectsof the First World War,",
  "production from heavy industry was still surprisingly low. In 1929 for example,",
  "France, which did not rank as a leading industrial power, produced more coal and",
  "steel than Russia, while Germany, Britain and especially the USA were streets",
  "ahead. Stalin believed that a rapid expansion of heavy industry was essential to",
  "enable Russia to deal with the attack which he was convinced would come sooner",
  "or later from the western capitalist powers, who hated communism.",
  "Industrialization would have the added advantage of increasing support for the",

  "Hundreds of foreign technicians were brought in and great emphasis was placed on",
  "expanding education in colleges and universities, and even in factory schools, to provide",
  "a whole new generation of skilled workers. In the factories, the old capitalist methods of",
  "piecework and pay differentials between skilled and unskilled workers were used to",
  "encourage production. Medals were given to workers who achieved record output; these",
  "were known as Stakhanovites, after Alexei Stakhanov, a champion miner who, in August",
  "-",
  "1935,supported by a well organized team, managed tocut 102 tonsofcoal in asingleshift",
  "(by ordinary methods even the highly efficient miners of the Ruhr in Germany were",
  "cutting only 10 tons per shift).",
  "Unfortunately the Plans had their drawbacks.Ordinary workers were ruthlessly disci\u00ac",
  "plined: there were severe punishments for bad workmanship, people were accused of",
  "being \u2018saboteurs\u2019 or \u2018wreckers\u2019 when targets were not met, and given spells in forced",
  "labour camps. Primitive housing conditions and a severe shortage of consumer goods",
  "(because of the concentration on heavy industry), on top of all the regimentation, must",
  "have made life grim for most workers. As historian Richard Freeborn pointed out (in A",
  "Short History of Modern Russia): \u2018It is probably no exaggeration to claim that the First",
  "Five Year Plan represented a declaration of war by the state machine against the workers",
  "and peasants of the USSR who were subjected to a greater exploitation than any they had",
  "known under capitalism.\u2019 However, by the mid-1930s things were improving as benefits",
  "such as medical care, education and holidays with pay became available. Another major",
  "drawback with the Plans was that many of the products were of poor quality. The high",
  "targets forced workers to speed up and this caused shoddy workmanship and damage to",
  "machinery.",
  "In spite of the weaknesses of the Plans, Martin McCauley (in Stalin and Stalinism)",
  "believes that \u2018the First Five-Year Plan wasa period of genuine enthusiasm,and prodigious",
  "achievements were recorded in production. The impossible targets galvanized people into",
  "action, and more was achieved than would have been the case had orthodox advice been",
  "followed.\u2019 Alec Nove leaned towards a similar view; he argued that, given the industrial",
  "backwardness inherited from the tsarist period, something drastic was needed. \u2018Under",
  "Stalin\u2019s leadership an assault was launched ... which succeeded in part but failed in some",
  "sectors. ... A great industry was built ... and where would the Russian army have been in",

  "THEUSSR ANDSTALIN, 1924-53 377(c) The collectivization of agriculture",
  "The problems of agriculture were dealt with by the process known as \u2018collectivization\u2019.",
  "The idea was that small farmsand holdings belonging to the peasantsshould be merged to",
  "form large collective farms (kolkhoz) jointly owned by the peasants.There were two main",
  "reasons for Stalin\u2019s decision to collectivize.",
  "(cid:127) The existing system of smallfarms was inefficient,and seemed unable to satisfy the",
  ".",
  "increasing demand for food, especially in the growing industrial cities However,",
  "largefarms, under state direction,and using tractorsand combine harvesters, would",
  ".",
  "vastly increase grain production, or so the theory went",
  "(cid:127) He wanted to eliminate the class of prosperous peasants (kulaks), which NEP had",
  "encouraged, because, he claimed, they were standing in the way of progress. The",
  "real reason was probably political: Stalin saw the kulaks as the enemy of commu",
  "\u00ac",
  "nism. \u2018We must smash the kulaks so hard that they will never rise to their feet",
  "again.\u2019",
  "The policy was launched in earnest in 1929,and had to be carried through by sheer brute",
  ".",
  "force, so determined was the resistance in the countryside It proved to be a disaster, and",
  "it took Russia at least half a century to recover. There was no problem in collectivizing",
  "landless labourers, but all peasants who owned any property at all, whether they were",
  "kulaks or not, were hostile to the plan, and had to be forced to join by armies of party",
  "members, who urged poorer peasants to seize cattle and machinery from the kulaks to be",
  "handed over to the collectives. Kulaks often reacted by slaughtering cattle and burning",
  "crops rather than allow the state to take them.Peasants who refused to join collectivefarms",
  "were arrested and taken to labourcamps,or shot. When newly collectivized peasants tried",
  "to sabotage the system by producing only enough for their own needs, local officials",
  "insisted on seizing the required quotas. In this way, well over 90 per cent of all farmland",
  ".",
  "had been collectivized by 1937",
  "In one sense Stalin could claim that collectivization was a success: it allowed greater",
  "mechanization, which did achieve a substantial increase in production in 1937. The",
  "amount of grain taken by the state increased impressively and so did grain exports: 1930",
  "and 1931 were excellent yearsforexports,and although theamountsfellsharply after that,",
  ".",
  "they were still far higher than before collectivization On the other hand, so many animals",
  "had been slaughtered that it was 1953 before livestock production recovered to the 1928",
  "figure, and the cost in human life and suffering was enormous.",
  "The truth was that total grain production did not increase at all (except for 1930)-in",
  "fact it was less in 1934 than it had been in 1928. The reasons for this failure were:",
  "(cid:127) The best producers-the kulaks-were excluded from the collectivefarms. Most of",
  "the party activists who came from the cities to organize collectivization did not",
  "know much about agriculture.",
  "(cid:127) Many peasants were demoralized after the seizure of their land and property; some",
  "of them left the kolkhoz to look for jobs in the cities. With all the arrestsand depor",

  "The governmentdid not at first provide sufficient tractors;since many peasants had",

  "\u00ac",

  "ment had been driven underground Although his personal dictatorship was complete,",
  "Stalin did not feel secure; he became increasingly suspicious, trusted nobody and seemed",
  "to see plots everywhere. The main political issues during these years were:",
  "1 By the summer of 1930, the government\u2019s popularity with the general public had",
  "fallen sharply because of collectivization and the hardships of the First Five Year",
  "Plan. There was growing opposition to Stalin in the Party;a document known as the",
  "\u2018Ryutin Platform\u2019 (after one of the Moscow party leaders) was circulated,advocating",
  "THEUSSR ANDSTALIN,1924-53 379.",
  "Revisionist historians have tried to shift the blame to some extent away from Stalin J.",
  "Arch Getty argues that the Purges were a form of political infighting at the top. He plays",
  "down the role of Stalin and claims that it was the obsessive fears of all the leaders which",
  "generated the Terror. Sheila Fitzpatrick suggests that the Purges must be seen in the",
  "context of continuing revolution; the circumstances were abnormal - all revolutions are",
  "faced by constant conspiracies designed to destroy them, so abnormal responses can be",
  "expected.",
  "Some of the most recentevidence toemergefrom the Sovietarchivesseems to bear out",
  "the traditional view. Dmitri Volkogonov came to the conclusion that Stalin simply had an",
  "evil mind and lacked any moral sense. It was Stalin who gave the orders to Nikolai",
  "Yezhov, head of the NKVD (as the secret police were now called), about the scale of the",
  "repressions,and it was Stalin who personally approved long listsof people to be executed.",
  "After he had announced the end of the Terror, Stalin made Yezhov the scapegoat, accus",
  "\u00ac",
  "ing him and his subordinates of going too far. Yezhov was a \u2018scoundrel\u2019 who was guilty",

  "Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan had declared themselves independent and soon showed",
  "themselves to be anti-Bolshevik. Stalin, who was appointed commissar (minister) for",
  "nationalities by Lenin,decided that these hostile states surrounding Russia were too much",
  "of a threat; during the civil war they were all forced to become part of Russia again. By",
  "1925 there were six Soviet republics -Russia itself, Transcaucasia (consisting of Georgia,",
  "Armenia and Azerbaijan), Ukraine, Belorussia, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan.",
  "The problem for the communist government was that 47 per cent of the population of",
  "theUSSR were non-Russian,and it would bedifficult to hold them all together if they were",
  "bitterly resentful of rule from Moscow. Stalin adopted a two-handed approach, which",

  "(cid:127)",
  "on the other hand, it had to be clearly understood that Moscow had the final say in",

  "Moscow.",
  "When the Ukrainian Communist Party stepped out of line in 1932 by admitting thatcollec",

  "people who benefited from it These included all the officials in the party state bureau",
  "\u00ac",
  "cracy and trade unions, the new managerial classes and key industrial workers - the",
  "new elite. The social historians suggested that to some extent these people were able to",
  "show \u2018initiatives from below\u2019, and even negotiate and bargain with the regime, so that",
  "they were able to influence policy. A further twist occurred during the 1980s when a",
  "group of historians, notably J. Arch Getty, claimed that the \u2018totalitarian\u2019 historians had",
  "exaggerated Stalin\u2019s personal role; they suggested that his system was inefficient and",

  "chaotic",
  "The \u2018totalitarian\u2019 writers criticized Arch Getty and his colleagues on the grounds that",
  "they were trying to whitewash Stalin and to gloss over the criminal aspectsof his policies.",
  "The latter in turn accused the totalitarianists of Cold War prejudice-refusing to recognize",
  "that anything good could come out of a communist system.",
  "From the new evidence emerging from the archives, it is now possible to arrive at a",

  "(a) A hard life",
  "Although the ideals were impressive,all the evidence suggests that the most striking point",
  "about everyday life in the early 1930s was that everything, including food, seemed to be",
  "in short supply. This was partly because of the concentration on heavy industry at the",
  "expense of consumer goods, and partly because of famine and bad harvests. In 1933 the",
  "average married worker in Moscow consumed less than half the amountof bread and flour",
  "consumed by his counterpart around 1900. In 1937, average real wages were only about",
  "- .",
  "three fifths of what they had been in 1928",
  "The rapid growth of the urban population - which increased by 31 million between",
  "1926 and 1939-caused serious housing shortages. Local soviets controlled all the hous",
  "\u00ac",
  "ing in a town; they had the power to evict residents and move new residents into already",
  "occupied houses. It wascommon for middle-classfamilies living in large houses to be told",
  "that they were taking up too much space and to find their home transformed into a",
  "\u2018communal apartment\u2019 as perhaps two or three other families were moved in. Kitchens,",
  "bathrooms and toilets were shared between families, and most large houses had people",
  ".",
  "living in corridors and under staircases Even lessfortunate were the workers who lived in",
  "barracks. In the new industrial city of Magnitogorsk in 1938, half the housing consisted of",
  "barracks, which was the usual accommodation for unmarried workers and students. City",
  "conditions generally were poor; most of them lacked efficient sewage systems, running",
  ".",
  "water, electric light and street lights Moscow was the exception - here the government",
  "made a real effort to make the capital something to be proud of.",
  "One of the most annoying aspects of life for ordinary people was the existence of",
  "specialelite groupssuch as party members,governmentofficials in the bureaucracy (these",
  "were knownasnomenklatura),successful membersof theintelligentsia,engineers,experts",

  "dachas (country houses).This resulted in a \u2018them and us\u2019 attitude,and ordinary peoplefelt",
  "aggrieved that they were still the underdogs.",
  "(b) Signs of improvement",
  "In a speech in November 1935 Stalin told his audience of Stakhanovites: \u2018life has become",
  "better,life has become more joyous\u2019.This was notentirely wishful thinking:foodsupplies",
  "384 PART III COMMUNISM-RISE ANDDECLINE.",
  "improved and all rationing wasabolished in 1936 The provision of cheap mealsin factory",
  ".",
  "canteens and free work clothes was a great help Education and healthcare were free, and",
  "the number of schools and medical centres was increasing. The government worked hard",
  "at the concept of state paternalism - the idea that the population were like children, who",
  ".",
  "must be looked after, protected and guided by the state, which acted as a sort of guardian",
  "The state provided more facilities for leisure: by the end of the 1930s there were close on",
  "30 000 cinemas, there were sports facilities for players and spectators, and there were",
  "public gardens and culture parks. The largest and most famous was Gorky Park in",
  "Moscow, named after Maxim Gorky,one of Stalin\u2019s favourite writers. Most towns of any",
  "size had a theatre and a library.",
  "Another important aspect of the state\u2019s role was to encourage what the Russians called",
  "kul\u2019turnost\u2019 - \u2018culturedness\u2019. This involved taking care over one\u2019s appearance and",
  "personal hygiene. Some industrial enterprises ordered that all engineers and managers",
  "should be clean-shaven and have their hair neatly cut. Conditions in barracks were",
  "improved by the use of partitions, so that each person had his own space. Other signs of",
  "culture were sleeping on sheets, eating with a knife and fork, avoiding drunkenness and",
  "bad language and not beating your wife and children. According to Stephen Kotkin, the",
  "cultured person was one who had learned to \u2018speak Bolshevik\u2019: he knew how to conduct",
  "himself in the workplace, stopped spitting on the floor, could make a speech and propose",
  ".",
  "a motion; and he could understand the basic ideas of Marxism",
  "\u2018Culturedness\u2019 was extended to shopping: at the end of 1934 over 13 000 new bread",
  "shops opened across the country; the assistants wore white smocks and caps and had",
  ".",
  "lessons in how to be polite to customers Strict new sanitary regulations were brought in",
  "and loaves had to be wrapped. This campaign for \u2018cultured trade\u2019 spread to every shop in",
  "the country, from the largest Moscow department store to the smallest bread shop.",
  "(c) The state, women and the family",
  "The 1930s were a difficult time for many families because of the \u2018disappearance\u2019 of so",
  "many men during collectivization, the famine and the Purges. There was a high desertion",
  "and divorce rate, and millions of women were left as the sole breadwinner in the family.",
  "During the rapid industrialization of the 1930s more than 10 million women became wage",
  "earnersfor thefirst time; the percentage of women at work rose from 24 per cent to 39 per",
  "cent of the total paid workforce. By 1940 about two-thirdsof the workforce in light indus",
  "\u00ac",
  "try were women and many were even engaged in heavier jobs such as construction,",
  "lumbering and machine-building, which were traditionally thought of as men\u2019s work.",
  "The government faced the dilemma that it needed women to provide much of the work",
  "\u00ac",
  "force for the industrialization drive, while at the same time it wanted to encourage and",
  "strengthen the family unit. One way of coping was to build more day-care centres and",
  "nurseries for children - the number of places doubled in the two years 1929-30. In the",
  "mid-1930s new laws were passed encouraging women to have as many children as possi",
  "\u00ac",
  "ble; abortion was made illegal except in cases where the mother\u2019s life was in danger;",
  "maternity leave of up to 16 weeks wasallowed and there were to be various subsidies and",
  "other benefits for pregnant women. Even so, this placed a heavy burden on working-class",
  "and peasant women, who were expected to producechildren, take jobs,increaseoutputand",
  ".",
  "look after the household and family",
  "Things were different for wivesof the elite,and for educated women,either married or",
  "single, who had professional jobs. They were seen by the state as part of its campaign to",
  "\u2018civilize\u2019 the masses. The Wives\u2019 Movement, as it became known, began in 1936; its aim",
  "was to raise the culturedness of the people the wives came into contact with, particularly",
  "those in their husbands\u2019 workplaces.Their main duty was to makeacomfortable home life",
  "THEUSSR ANDSTALIN, 1924-53 385.",
  "for their husbands and families Towards the end of the 1930s,as war began to seem more",
  "likely, the Wives\u2019 Movement encouraged women to learn to drive lorries,shoot,and even",
  "to fly planes, so that they would be ready to take men\u2019s places if they had to go to war.",
  "(d) Education",
  "One of the greatest achievements of the Stalinist regime was the expansion of free, mass",
  "education. In 1917 under half the population could be described as literate. In January",
  "1930 the government announced that by the end of the summer, all children aged 8 to 11",
  ".",
  "must be enrolled in schools Between 1929 and 1931 the number of pupils increased from",
  "14 million to around 20 million; it was in rural areas, where education had been patchy,",
  "that most of the increase took place. By 1940 there were 199 000 schools, and even the",
  "most remote areas of the USSR were well provided. Many new training colleges were set",
  "up to train the new generation of teachers and lecturers. According to the census of 1939,",
  "of people aged between 9 and 49, 94 per cent in the towns and 86 per cent in rural areas",
  "were literate. By 1959 these percentages had increased to 99 and 98, respectively.",
  "Of course the regime had an ulterior motive-education was the way by which it could",
  "turn the younger generation into good,orthodoxSoviet citizens. Religion and other \u2018bour",
  "\u00ac",
  "geois\u2019 practices were presented as superstitious and backward. Ironically, the education",
  "experts decided that a return to traditional teaching methods would be better than the",
  ".",
  "experimental, more relaxed techniques tried in the 1920s These had included theabolition",
  ".",
  "of examinations and punishments, and an emphasis on project work This was now",
  "reversed: teachers were given more authority and were to impose strict discipline, exami",
  "\u00ac",
  "nations were brought back and more teaching time was to be spent on mathematics and",
  ".",
  "science",
  "(e) Religion",
  "Lenin, Stalin and the other Bolshevik leaders were atheists who accepted Marx\u2019s claim",
  "that religion was merely an invention of the ruling classes to keep the people docile and",
  ".",
  "under control - the \u2018opium of the masses\u2019 Lenin had launched a savage attack on the",
  "Orthodox Church,seizing all its lands,schoolsand church buildings,and having hundreds",
  "of priestsarrested. After Lenin\u2019sdeath the regime became more tolerant towards religious",
  "groups. Many priests were sympathetic towards communist ideals, which, after all, do",
  "have some similarities to Christian teachings about the poor and oppressed.There seemed",
  "agood chance of complete reconciliation between Church and State;with careful handling",
  "the Churchcould have been usefulin helping tocontrol the peasants.However,many mili",
  "tant young communists continued to believe that religion was a \u2018harmful superstition\u2019. A\u00ac",

  ".",
  "Relations deteriorated disastrously during Stalin\u2019s regime Many priests courageously",
  "opposed collectivization, so Stalin secretly instructed local party organizations to attack",
  ".",
  "churches and priests Hundreds of churches and cemeteries were vandalized and literally",
  "thousands of priests were killed. The number of working priests fell from about 60 000 in",
  "1925 to under 6000 by 1941. The slaughter was not confined to Christians: hundreds of",
  "Muslim and Jewish leaders also fell victim. The campaign was relentless: by 1941 only",
  "one in 40 church buildings was still functioning asa place of worship. For the Bolsheviks,",
  "communism was the only religion, and they were determined that people should worship",
  ".",
  "the communist state instead of God",
  "-",
  "The anti religious campaign caused outrage, especially in rural areas where priests,",
  "386 PART III COMMUNISM-RISE ANDDECLINEmullahs, shamans and rabbis were p.opular and respected members of the local communi\u00ac",
  "ties. During the Second World War State and Church were to some extent reconciled. In",
  "1942, with the war going. badly lor the Russians, and both Leningrad and Moscow under",
  "attack from the Germans Stalin decided that religion had a role to play after all,as a force",
  "tor patriotism. An understanding was reached with Christians,Jews and Muslims that past",
  "differences would be forgotten in their joint struggle against the invader. Churches,",
  "mosques and synagogues were allowed to reopen, and by most accounts, the religious",

  "groups played a vital role in maintaining morale among the general public",

  "The years 1928 to 1931 became known as \u2018the Cultural Revolution\u2019 when the regime",

  "some RAPP members failed to respond to thisclear warning, Stalin disbanded both RAPP",
  "and the new AUSW. replacing them with one organization -the Union of Soviet Writers,",
  "chaired by Maxim Gorky, whose works Stalin admired. Andrei Zhdanov emerged as the",

  "Stalin, like Lenin, considered that film was probably the most important form of commu",
  "\u00ac",
  "nication; he loved films and had a private cinema in the Kremlin and one in his dacha. He",
  "demanded that Soviet films should be \u2018intelligible to the millions\u2019, telling a simple but",
  "powerful story. In 1930 Boris Shumyatsky was given the job of modernizing the film",
  "industry; he aimed to make films which were genuinely entertaining as well as being full",
  "of \u2018socialist realism\u2019.Unfortunately,he was hampered by thearrival of soundfilms-these",
  "were more expensive to make, and there was a language problem in a country where so",
  ".",
  "many different languages were spoken Another difficulty was the almost impossible",
  "demands of the regime, which wanted film-makers to incorporate so many different and",
  "sometimes contradictory themes into their work - proletarian values, classless Soviet",
  "nationalism,the problemsof ordinary people, the heroicexploitsof the revolutionariesand",

  "the glorious communist future",
  "In 1935 Shumyatsky went to Hollywood to look for new ideas; he decided that the",

  "the government refused to provide the necessary finance and the project never got off the",
  ".",
  "ground Stalin was not satisfied with Shumyatsky\u2019s progress, and in 1938 he was arrested",
  "and shot. In spite of all these problems, over 300 Soviet films were made between 1933",
  ".",
  "and 1940, some of which were of high quality There was a huge increase in the number",

  "of cinemas during the same period-from about 7000 to around 30 000",
  "Not all of these films found favour with Stalin, who became so obsessed that he vetted",
  "many scripts himself. He had to be satisfied that they successfully put over the message",
  "that life in the USSR was betterand happier in every way than anywhere else in the world.",

  "(a) The aftermath of the war",
  "The Soviet victory in theSecond World War was only achieved by enormous sacrificesof",
  "human life,far in excessof the lossesof all the other participants put together.There were",
  "6.2million military personnel dead, 15 million wounded,and 4.4million capturedor miss",
  "\u00ac",
  "ing. On top of that there were about 17 million civilian deaths, giving a total Soviet war",
  "dead not far short of 25 million.The areas occupied by the Germans were left in ruins; 25",
  "million people were homeless. In effect, the entire modernization programme of the Five",
  "Year Plans had to be started all over again in the western parts of the country. Stalin saw",
  "the victory as the ultimate vindication of his entire system of government; it had passed",
  "389",
  "THEUSSR ANDSTALIN, 1924-53.",
  "the sternest test imaginable - total war As far as he was concerned, the Russian people",
  "now faced another challenge-the battle to rebuild the Soviet Union.",
  "(b) Stalin's last battles",
  "Any Soviet citizens who were expecting more freedom and a more relaxed way of life as",
  "a reward for their superhuman efforts during the war were quickly disillusioned. Stalin",
  "was well aware of the growing unrest and the desire for radical change. Peasants were",
  "disgusted with the tiny wages paid on the collectives and were beginning to take land",
  ".",
  "back and farm it for themselves Industrial workers were protesting about low wages and",
  "rising food prices. People in the newly acquired areas - the Baltic states and western",
  "Ukraine (see Map 17.1)-bitterly resented Soviet rule and resorted to armed resistance.",
  "Stalin was utterly ruthless: nationalist risings were crushed and about 300 000 people",
  "deported from western Ukraine. The population of the labour camps more than doubled",
  "to about 2.5 million. Peasants and industrial workers once again came under military-",
  ".",
  "style discipline",
  ".",
  "Stalinsawenemies everywhere Soviet soldiers who had been captured by the Germans",
  "were seen as tainted, potential traitors. It seems beyond belief that 2.8 million Red Army",
  "soldiers, who had survived appalling treatment in Hitler\u2019s prison camps, returned to their",
  "homeland only to be arrested by the NKVD.Some were shot,some were sent to the Gulag",
  "and only about a third were allowed home. One of Stalin\u2019s motives for sending so many",
  "people to labour camps was to ensure a constant supply of cheap labourforcoalminesand",
  "other projects. Another category of \u2018tainted\u2019 people were those who had come into Allied",
  "hands during the final months of the war. They were now suspect because they had seen",
  "that life in the west was materially better than in the USSR. About 3 million of them were",
  "sent to labour camps.",
  "Thetask of rebuilding thecountry wastackledbythe FourthFiveYear Plan(1946-50),",
  "which,if the official statistics are to be believed,succeeded in restoring industrial produc",
  "\u00ac",
  "tion to its 1940 levels.The outstanding achievement wasconsidered to be the explosion in",
  "Kazakhstan, in August 1949, of the first Soviet atomic bomb. However, the great failure",
  "of the Plan was in agriculture: the 1946 harvest was less than that of 1945, resulting in",
  "famine, starvation and reports of cannibalism. Peasants were leaving the collectives in",
  "droves to try tofind jobsin industry.Production of all agricultural commodities wasdown.",
  "-",
  "Even in 1952 the grain harvest reached only three quarters of the 1940 harvest. As Alec",
  "Nove commented: \u2018How could it be tolerated that a country capable of making an atomic",
  "bomb could not supply its citizens with eggs?\u2019",
  "Stalin also launched the battle to re-establish control over the intelligentsia, who,",
  "Stalin felt, had become too independent during the war years. Beginning in August 1946,",
  "Zhdanov, the Leningrad party boss, led the attack. Hundreds of writers were expelled",
  "from the union; all the leading composers were in disgrace and their music banned. The",
  "campaign continued into the early 1950s, though Zhdanov himself died of a heart attack",
  ".",
  "in August 1948 After Zhdanov\u2019sdeath, Stalin carried out a purge of the Leningrad party",
  "organization, who were all arrested, found guilty of plotting to seize power, and",
  ".",
  "executed",
  "The final act in the drama was the so-called Doctors' Plot. In November 1952 13",
  "Moscow doctors, who had treated Stalin and other leaders at different times, were arrested",
  ".",
  "and accusedof conspiring to kill theireminent patients Sixof the doctors wereJewish and",
  "this was the signal for an outburst of anti-Semitism. By this time nobody felt safe. There",
  "is evidence that Stalin was working up to another major purge of leading figures in the",
  "party, with Molotov, Mikoyan and Beria on the list. Fortunately for them, Stalin died of a",
  "brain haemorrhage on 5 March 1953.",
